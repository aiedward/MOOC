The course is well planned and easy to follow. The profs deliver the course material in a fresh and simple way to get students thinking. The videos are great and guest interviews extremely helpful. I've learnt lots in just a few weeks and have already passed on some of this thinking - especially ways of studying - to others. A must course to take!!!</review><course_id>36404</course_id><course_title>The Science of Everyday Thinking</course_title><reviewer_id>29137</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-04-20</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>As far as MOOCs go, this course is the best.

A great experience and a wonderful way to learn, too! Arguments were introduced in an interesting and involving manner, suiting all learning styles, with many possibilities to review material - especially those complex concepts that I'm still struggling with! If anything, it has given me a real thirst to question the world and myself and the world I live in, and a desire to share what I've learned with everybody – to my wife’s chagrin! P.S. I've already signed up for another MOOCs course!</review><course_id>36404</course_id><course_title>The Science of Everyday Thinking</course_title><reviewer_id>36946</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-06-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Jason, Matt, Emma - you did a superbe job. With this course you set a benchmark for future courses that I will follow. The quality of the scientists you spoke to, the quality of the videos, they way you moderated the course, the quizzes, learn more and progress sections - all top quality. This topic was extremely insightful. I love I would have had a similar course offer during my studies some 20 years ago. Thumbs up! Now celebrate and relax. You changed the world.

And that must be good , right? And not merely the retailing of old shibboleths, in some brand-new, "scientific" terminology. Why do we think? How? Do the strange, strangulated sounds first made by a (mostly) hairless ape several thousand years ago have a logical structure inherent in them, and if so, why? Aristotle thought so: most modern logicians disagree. But what is science, if not the systematic application of these sounds to "laws" it thinks it discerns in the world around us? And the assumption that language itself is transactional, not ambiguous, multivalent and poetic in nature: that real thought is and always has been, poetic because it makes the reality it describes, just as the instrument in quantum physics determines the outcome of an experiment. Still I'm thinking that anything 80,000 people follow must be an entertaining spectacle, even if it's just like Homer picked apart by Plato. But I'm haunted by the Ray Bradbury short story in which academic dinosaurs from Venus think they've discovered the secret of a long- vanished earth's death wish. "Look at the mindless violence! The relish of gratuitous pain! The brainlessness!" they say, showing an old Walt Disney cartoon.

It delves into our subconscious while showing how our perceptions and memories can be false.

On one hand they rightly warned about false thinking and pointed out where people often go wrong. but on the other hand they were failing to be critical of many scientists who are just as prone to weak thinking, poorly designed experiments, poor understanding of statistical methods and application and a whole host of other failings including often 'adjusting' findings to suit the interests of their funders. Those climate change deniers who are scientists and many scientists in the health industry too are good examples where 'adjustments' of 'scientific findings' are rife. Just because someone wears a white coat and talks in a scientific language doesn't mean they actually follow a 'scientific method'. This was especially noticeable in the health section (about which I know a fair deal) where the 'scientists' Jason &amp; Matt interviewed were fairly ignorant and arrogant about areas about which they clearly understood very little. Just because something quacks like a duck doesn't mean it is a duck, it is just as likely to be a hunter trying to catch some prey – in this case Jason &amp; Matt who fell head over heels for the half-lies and/or 'scientific' misconceptions. Yes, 'alternative medicine' can be extremely dangerous but so can 'scientific medicine' as the hundreds of thousands of deaths a year due to 'scientific medical mistakes' will attest. As a senior analyst throughout nearly all my working life (I am retired now) I am very well used to people seeing the failings in other people's arguments but totally missing the failings in their own arguments. I am sorry to say that Jason and Matt fall into this category, rightly seeing other people's failings but totally failing to see their own failings. I have been doing some research for a few years now (for personal interest) in the areas covered by the course and can confirm that in general the course is on the right track, the problem is just with the presenters / lecturers and their comments. The course is worth running again but either new lecturers are needed or Jason &amp; Matt really need to get their act together, stop being hypocrites and wise up to the severe errors and failings of the so-called 'scientific method', great in theory but having serious failings in practice.</review><course_id>36404</course_id><course_title>The Science of Everyday Thinking</course_title><reviewer_id>35802</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-06-19</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>There were the usual retellings of the classic experiments and a number of good examples for the points they were trying to make. Perhaps the biggest negative for me was their biased presentation, they wanted to make some general "cultural" commentary as well as helping others learn to think better. In other words, when you believe what they believe, you're a pretty good thinker and if you don't believe as they do, well, you're clearly making one of these errors and until you think as they do you will continue to be error prone. Oh yeah, with the insincere disclaimer thrown in that each of us need to make decisions for ourselves, they just need to be considered in light of evidence. Which means think as they do. I was not impressed with the pompous presentation even though I have encountered most of the research previously and find it to be good. But even the best ideas can be presented in a biased manner, and this is an example. An adequate introduction for those completely new as long as they take in the propagandist undertones as such and then move on to other presentations of the same or similar ideas. But please, don't let these guys be the end of your learning in this area, you'll be doing a great injustice to both the researchers who were covered and the ideas they formed.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>36404</course_id><course_title>The Science of Everyday Thinking</course_title><reviewer_id>116888</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-12-20</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I've taken more than 10 MOOC's and this was one of the best.

Then, I found the questions more interesting than the answers. There's much we don't know about the process of thinking, so most of the answers provided here are to show us how limited our perceptions are. True, probably, and a bit discouraging too, seeing a lifetime devoted Nobel prize admit he doesn't quite believe we can do much better. So the scientific method is the only thing we know on how to test our assumptions.

I personally have worked the instruction in a different way summarizing the main concepts and working on metaphors to explain the main underlying idea behind the concept and have added the complete interviews with the different experts as an extra material. Additionally I would have included inter chapter not graded tests helping the understanding and memorization of the concepts and better assimilate and learn the material. The chapter graded test was sometimes tricky in relation to wich of the assertions better described the question and I think this is nonsensical from a pedagogical point of view, sometimes they were unclearl to me as a foreign students and some questions were rated inadequately sometimes, because there could be more than one answer. The discussion part simply didn't work properly I would have set a random peer review per student which should have been more fruitful. I am most grateful to the teachers and experts participating in the project for their time and effort. Thank you very much indeed. I hope to revisit the content in order to better memorize the aspects I have found most interesting.

This was my first. The Science of Everyday Thinking was fascinating, well presented, and a unique learning experience. I took this course to see if I could learn on line. I could but found it to be as demanding as any course I have taken. I took this course to learn new ideas that would be valuable in my everyday life. I learned many and have discovered that reading the paper has become a different experience and ideas explored easily come up in everyday conversations with friends and family.

If Harvard's "quintessential" course is CS50, UQ's is Think101. Take the course and you'll have a good foundation on whatever you'd do next (in your education/learning plan, in your work, or just in your day-to-day). Content: The pacing and progression was well thought out. Topics are interesting and thought-provoking. Insightful comments from the best in the field. What can be improved: Discussion can be more streamlined (but it's something that edX courses have in common as it's largely due to the forum's design) Instructor: They know what they're talking about. They seemed passionate about what they want to share (tools to improve your everyday thinking). No dull moment from the two instructors. I like how they seem to be just having a conversation. Provider: I've taken another course from UQ and it also didn't disappoint when it comes to content and production quality. You can feel that UQ actually prepared things for you and took the delivery of content seriously even though the course is free (unless of course you go for verified). I rarely give reviews, so this is something. Least I can do for the efforts put into this course.

But there is a conveat: the themes aren't neutral, they dwell heavily on topics that are polemical and with much financial interests behind, so that it loses much of its credibility. It is as though the intructors try and change our opinion in the appropriate sense according to some industry. I dropped out because I felt I was manipulated.</review><course_id>36404</course_id><course_title>The Science of Everyday Thinking</course_title><reviewer_id>119216</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-03-09</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>This course was poorly taught. Instructors should have used a more traditional lecture format. The terms that they wanted to teach should have put on screen. In video quizzes should have been included in each lecture. The conversations did not work, nor did switching to other locations. These proved that both instructors do not know how to learn or how they learn. Quizzes were also poorly developed. The questions were sometimes difficult to understand. Furthermore some of the questions were silly. Although it is true that the silly questions provided free points, clearly written cogent questions would have been better. Most of the terms were about similar concepts, so they were difficult to learn. More distinctions would have been helpful. The learning platform is primitive.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>36404</course_id><course_title>The Science of Everyday Thinking</course_title><reviewer_id>119161</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-03-07</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>i really enjoyed the course but the last bit about making a video and uploading etc I didn't have the technology to do so didn't do it and now I don't know if that has classed me to finishing the course???

With this a necessary order that everyone should know regardless of their interpretations related to human consciousness is established, this issue is difficult to manage because many of the beliefs today have support in science. Therefore this step is necessary to confront ideas that are very widely acceptable as placebo that is in a moment of understanding that can lead to the definitive assessment of a new paradigm of genetic biology or continuity of the parameters set effect Darwinian evolution.

I felt as if everything was explained perfectly, for me, a newbie to any of this subject matter. It didn't talk down, nor was it so lofty that those with no experience would feel as if it was in a different language.

Before this course I had no idea my subconscious was so active, I fell victim to poor thought processes, and many heuristics. The tools I took from this course have seriously changed my life, my whole process of thinking is better, I analyze things and demand evidence, I don't have as much trouble with the planning fallacy anymore either and whenever I make decisions I look inward as to "whats causing me to make this decision?" as opposed to being on auto pilot. Anyone with ADD or ADHD should take this course.

This course should be part of the curriculum in Australian public secondary schools, giving the next generation the tools to sort fact from fiction and to use reason and scientific method in their decision making process. The content is well thought out and flows cleanly throughout the modules allowing the student ample time to absorb and understand the material. It challenges your thinking processes and forces you to re-evaluate your methods of reasoning. Most importantly it gives you extremely powerful tools to take away with you. I don't have the word to clearly express my gratitude and respect for the people that have put this brilliant course together.... you have changed my world for the better.

Of course just doing a course and getting excited about it is one thing, practising it another. A simple question I always ask..."Is where is this information coming from, and what do they have to gain?"</review><course_id>36404</course_id><course_title>The Science of Everyday Thinking</course_title><reviewer_id>114465</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-10-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Really enjoying this course and learning such a lot.

I ONLY listened to the online presentations and took the chapter quizzes immediately after I finished the corresponding online episode. I am not interested in a certificate. I found the course very interesting and informative. The only thing I do not understand is the EMPHASIS that is put on the NAMES of the theories or hypotheses both in chapter quizzes and the final exam. My question to you is the following: If I understand the process or the theory and learn how to avoid an associated pitfall, why should I care to know what it is called (heuristic representation, heuristic availability or multitude of other terms you used for different effects)? or who said what in his or her interview? I give you an example to help you understand where I am coming from. I am an engineer and think if a 5th grader knows c.(a+b)=ca+cb, it makes NO difference if s/he knows it is called distributive property or commutative property or associative property for multiplication. Even if s/he calls this property with a WRONG name, it makes ABSOLUTELY no difference practically as long as s/he uses the property correctly. But similar to your course, in math courses from 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, .....to 12th grade and well into university math, the student is tested on whether s/he knows the name of the property and more importantly her/his ability to perform the actual multiplication is wrongly evaluated based on knowing or not knowing the NAME of this or that property. I am POSITIVE you have a reason (or some reasons) for what you are doing and tried to see them. I guess you might be thinking since some people are taking this course for a certificate they have to distinguish one theory from another by name. You may be thinking ............ Overall, I would like to thank you for all your hard work and congratulate you for a meaningful course from which I benefited.

I had no idea what to expect but the description intrigued me and the reviews of other students hooked me. Of course, in this course we are told to be careful about testimonials without testing the evidence. Having taken the course I can say it truly opened my eyes and my mind. At age 59, I'm coming to this material rather late in life but am so grateful to have discovered this now. The techniques and concepts have relevance to many important issues that affect us as human beings and as a society.I like to think of myself as being fairly broad-minded but this course showed me a great deal more. I just wish The Science of Everyday Thinking was taught in all our schools because it could revolutionize how we view education.

The explanation of heuristics and how they influence our judgments and beliefs was fascinating. I must take issue though with what I perceive to be the empirical philosophy of the course. The idea seems to be expressed that if you "know more" ie everything, you can understand fully. I believe on the contrary that not all of our universe falls into a causally determined closed circle. Universal concepts such as beauty can't be measured or fully understood. Human consciousness, the existence of life, logic, mathematics, Plato's essences, God (though not the all powerful, all knowing, all loving father figure often meant by this term) all seem to me to lie outside the circle. In the survey we have God listed right along with voodoo and I feel this suggests a point of view with which I cannot agree. For more than a thousand years before Christ people have had personal experiences with Spirit that, at their core seem remarkably similar. Not everything can be measured and weighed.</review><course_id>36404</course_id><course_title>The Science of Everyday Thinking</course_title><reviewer_id>113834</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-10-02</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Possibly one of the best online courses currently available for free.

While it is not a standard introductory psychology course, it teaches you, in a very interactive way, how your mind is often deceived to biases and heuristics that you usually don't recognize. It also teaches you how you can use scientific reasoning to evaluate other people's claims and, more importantly, how YOU think about how the world works. It is more than a course, it is a journey of self-discovery and self-improvement.</review><course_id>36404</course_id><course_title>The Science of Everyday Thinking</course_title><reviewer_id>41935</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-07-14</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is an excellent course to help you to think on your feet :) There is a big emphasis on the scientific method, which is a essential skill to posses nowadays.

The academic framework was intelligible and appealing and also useful for construction and wider application. I completed the units in a rush having started very late but found the information so interesting that I needed to force myself to space and interleave the learning (following advice in one of the units!). So why only 4 stars? Should have been able to give it 4 and 3/4 stars really. Well, it seemed at times that the presenters may have also fallen into one of the cognitive traps with some of the refutation or perhaps derision of some myth busting for which the evidence remains unclear.</review><course_id>36404</course_id><course_title>The Science of Everyday Thinking</course_title><reviewer_id>37447</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-07-02</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Wow what a brilliant course.

For a long time I have been trying to convince people around me to become rational and stop being superstitious and irrational. The result? only few successes. I used to wonder why people reject logic for irrational beliefs! But, this course pinpointed the cause and gave me tools that I did not have. Now I am effectively using these tools and have already been successful at a greater rate. I am grateful to prof Jason and Matt and other staff for this wonderful gift of knowledge. My view is that this course should be mandatory for all freshers in universities and a briefer version should be taught in schools as well. In my country, India, this is not going to happen very soon as we already have 'astrology' being taught as science and homeopathy being promoted by govt. I hope some day it will change when more people become rational thinkers.</review><course_id>36404</course_id><course_title>The Science of Everyday Thinking</course_title><reviewer_id>37398</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-07-01</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I enjoyed this course.

I began this course on one of our school district's storm days, when I was virtually "snowed-in", thinking that it was about time I went back to school. I wasn't sure what to expect. Not only did I learn from Think 101, but I was entertained, and I had the opportunity to feel connected in a way that I did not generally feel in my university lectures (counter-intuitive, I know). There was a sense of momentum to this course, and a feeling that people all over the world were intrigued and excited. Of the EdX courses I registered for, this has been far and away the best, and I would suggest that the model for other successful courses may be here (at least for the social sciences). I have recommended the archived course to my students, and I will look forward to any new courses from this team.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>36404</course_id><course_title>The Science of Everyday Thinking</course_title><reviewer_id>36989</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-06-28</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>It was a great course!fun and interesting at the same time!!!!

Though I was aware with Edx and even remember its start, this was my first class from Edx. I am glad I took it. Though I was busy with life of course (who is not) i did read and watched all lectures. Some of them I even downloaded to my phone and listened when commuting to work. The class was well designed and uniquely presented. Thanks to this class, I questioned many of my earlier untested beliefs and searched for answers. I put to test some of the ideas presented. I can't say I have answers for all of them, but at least now I am aware of it. Overall, the topic was new to me and very abstract, but I am glad I took it and I learned a lot. I thank both Jason and Matthew (yes I believe I can call them by their first name) for well researched, well presented and very interesting class. I would also like to thank all the experts and the guests that contributed to the success of this class. And of course, my fellow students wherever you are thank you.

The links to the ted talks were very informative. I found the "change the world" idea at the end rather arrogant and overambitious. Throughout history, those who have tried to change the world have brought about great suffering to pursue their own agenda.

I'm sorry that it ended so quickly. Twelve weeks was not enough to cover the range of topics that we could of explored in more depth. I hope they continue on adding to this course. It definitely left me wanting more. The course showed us how our thoughts and feelings affect how we view our world and affects our actions. It delves into our subconscious while showing how our perceptions and memories can be false. It encourages scientific experimentation to test our beliefs and mostly encourages us to "Think". this course is the best. It has made me see the world differently in just a few weeks.

If you take this course we will learn why people believe weird things, how we form and change our opinions, why our expectations skew our judgments, and how we can make better decisions. It debates topics such as medical diagnosis, paranormal phenomena, placebos, miracles, and more. You will learn how to evaluate claims, make sense of evidence, and understand why we so often make irrational choices. The course provides tools for how to think independently, how to be sceptical, and how to value data over personal experience. We will examine the mental shortcuts and rules-of-thumb that people use and misuse, and apply this knowledge to everyday situations to help make better decisions.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>36404</course_id><course_title>The Science of Everyday Thinking</course_title><reviewer_id>36785</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-06-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Amazing course!!

The information and techniques I learned will be immensely helpful as I continue to take more edX courses. I only wish this course had been available to me before I went to university 10+ years ago. My newfound, and rediscovered, knowledge will also help me in my everyday thinking, as the name of the course implies. I had started to slack on my questioning of news sources despite training and experience in journalism. Think101 has re-lit my fire to discover and uncover the truth. It has also prompted me to simply take time to ponder and research not only what I am told but also question my own beliefs to ensure they are grounded in science. Finally, the resources Jason and Matt shared will be immensely helpful in future research. I am particularly excited to delve into the Cochrane Library.

An excellent introduction to the workings of "the mind". Any high school student would benefit from seeing the week 5 lecture on "Learning to Learn" and then discussing it with their teacher. I am certain that an honest application of the techniques discussed there would raise any student's marks noticeably. For graduating students going off to university and thinking about taking Psychology as an option or as a programme, Psych 101 just became a whole lot more understandable. Parents trying to help their kids learn and think more successfully will benefit from the opportunity to think about how the mind works and will gain much information and insight which they can pass on.

Being a science student, I was automatically attracted to this course as I was scrolling down the Edx page and lo and behold, I have learnt a lot from this course. I have even started using some of the terminologies in my everyday conversations with my colleadues, such as the confirmation bias, regression to the mean, availability heuristics and others. I say congratulations to the Think101x team.</review><course_id>36404</course_id><course_title>The Science of Everyday Thinking</course_title><reviewer_id>36633</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-06-23</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I have thoroughly enjoyed taking this course. I took this because I was bored and wanted something to challenge me. The course was enlightening, it made me look at things differently, it made me share what I learnt with others. This course really opened my eyes in many ways, it made me actually change some my beliefs. I thoroughly enjoyed how it was taught, the guest speakers, and the wide variety of subject matters. I would love more from Jason and Matt.</review><course_id>36404</course_id><course_title>The Science of Everyday Thinking</course_title><reviewer_id>36632</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-06-23</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>What an excellent class on thinking.

The course material was also divided into very interesting topics making a possibly esoteric and dry subject, wonderfully engaging and practical and real. I really looked forward to coming back for each Episode and looked forward to taking the time out to indulge in this course. My reason for taking the course was an interest in learning, improving myself and my mind, and simply - curiosity and fun. I found it fascinating to have this insight into thinking about how we think. To know that so many experts are doing so much research in this field.   I'm just pleased that I know more than I did.  I'm also excited that hopefully, I will "catch" myself and be "smarter" with my thinking! I am a bit sad that the course is over because of the attachment I had developed to it - coming back and listening and sometimes re-listening.

Well organized with interesting in-depth interviews with a variety of important thinkers. My one criticism is that often only one main view point was presented on key concepts. For example the slow and fast thinking (systems one and two) championed by Daniel Kahneman has been the object of some push back by thinkers such as Gerd Gigerenzer. OVerall a great course - one of the more illuminating I have taken in the MOOC format.</review><course_id>36404</course_id><course_title>The Science of Everyday Thinking</course_title><reviewer_id>36594</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-06-23</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Really enjoyed all aspects of the course, the content new and interesting and format was great, activities and quizzes were challenging.

You do not have to "suffer" any slides with academic expressions, overviews, and so on. The scientific content comes along somehow "undercover" and has to be "detected" by you. The first quiz will show you something about learning :). You will also get "Six Leads" to question every kind of information, which is useful and usable. I have taken two courses with similar content, but more "scientifically" styled  as mentioned above. They informed me, but they did not change my awareness and my thinking. This course did. As learned here, I also question the "academic value" of some of the information given in the course.

La estructura de actividades me pareció buena, motivadora, los felicito pues fueron pocas las palaras que no entendí, sino al escuchar, leyéndolas. Si bien el tema de las supersticiones ha sido relevante en comentarios, eso reafirma lo mostrado en el curso, se realza un punto particular de muchos otros que sí tienen apoyo. De todas maneras, me hubiese gustado en ese tema una opinión a favor. b. Al tomar el curso esperaba "recetas" para enfrentar la vida diaria. Recibí herramientas para analizar las situaciones de la vida diaria. Estoy contento. c. En la presentación del curso decía 2-3 hours/week pero creo que se requiere mucho más si se pretende meditar antes de responder las preguntas y aprovechar todo el material complementario. Las sesiones mayores a 7-8 minutos son agotadoras, especialmente para quienes no somos de habla inglesa. No me pareció "fair play" que las últimas evaluaciones tuvieran más o menos preguntas que las 10 de las evaluaciones anteriores. Eso cambió los porcentajes. d. El curso cumple con el objetivo de hace pensar y traspasarnos a cada uno la tarea de vivir la vida pensadamente.

The course is well planned and easy to follow. The profs delivered the course material in a fresh and simple way to get students thinking. The videos are great and guest interviews extremely helpful. I've learnt lots in just a few moths and have already passed on some of this thinking to my family, friends, especially ways of studying. thinking ability in decision making and to others who is interested. It is a must course to take for all especially African leaders who intends to lead their people right!!!I hope something better is coming in future. Keep it up.

While perusing the additional learning sections in some of the episodes, I found out that the material was often rather complex. So thanks for your effort, and also I am grateful to you for the knowledge that when a task appears daunting, it may be a 'desirable difficulty'. The only suggestion I would like to make, is to try and present both sides of the really controversial topics such as the Milgram Experiment more clearly. I do agree that some of the so called 'controversies' aren't really an argument but some truly are. Also, for EDx staff, can you make this website a little light?? I am from India, and the net connection is not very fast and the site takes forever to load.</review><course_id>36404</course_id><course_title>The Science of Everyday Thinking</course_title><reviewer_id>36034</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-06-20</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I recommend it.

The lessons that were the most helpful would include: Daniel Kahneman's theory of two systems (thinking fast and slow), the techniques for better learning, the Cochrane Library and 6 leads of opinion change. I do have an objection to some of the content. At the onset of the course we were taught to slow down our thinking and always look for the evidence to any claims. I didn't appreciate some of the guests making quite injudicious claims without presenting any scientific evidence to back those statements up (e.g. Ian Frazer about vaccines Jimmy Botella on GMOs...).</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>36404</course_id><course_title>The Science of Everyday Thinking</course_title><reviewer_id>36030</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-06-20</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I thought I was well informed on how to lead a better life.

Be warned though, it will change the universe you live in, or at least your perception of it! It may not always prove comfortable as you will start to perceive the world hopefully through a clearer window, but it will also make you realise how the window also distorts the view.

It gave me the motivation that I needed to apply for a psychology and philosophy BA course here in Malta.

I did not know what to expect from this course when I register but it is by far the best MOOCs I've ever followed. I am really delighted to have been part of this course as it was so creative and exciting. I used to discuss about most of the concepts with friends or family and I must confess that we all miss the course and the debates!

I wish there was a sequel, because I really enjoyed it. I found out about many interesting psychological phenomena and learned to connect it with real life around me. The videos are great, and the people who participated are all professionals in their fields so it was a great idea to include them in the course.

Upoznavanje s tipičnim greškama u razmišljanju, percepciji, sjećanju, učenju, procjenjivanju i donošenju odluka, kao i prepoznavanje tipičnih pokušaja iskorištavanja istih od strane svega i svačega.

Covers misconceptions about memory &amp; thinking, "thinking fast &amp; slow", cognitive biases and fallacies, effective learning techniques, evaluating evidence, health claims, and more. Tip 1: Read up more about the cognitive biases, fallacies, and heuristics. Tip 2: Don't put much time into the forums.

There was a lot of very good information, and many links to additional resources. This was my first MOOC so I wasn't sure what to expect, and overall feel positive. The negative involves the discussion forum/format. When there are 10,000++ comments each week it quickly becomes a bit of nonsense. There is no way to truly 'participate' as there are too many comments and it is a daunting task to review even a fraction. For me it quickly became a bit of a black hole where I felt like I was putting a note in a bottle and sending it off with the thought that maybe someone, someday would find it and read it - and knowing that I would never know. I wish that part of the class could be improved, but with so many people enrolled, I do not know how it could be done!</review><course_id>36404</course_id><course_title>The Science of Everyday Thinking</course_title><reviewer_id>35861</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-06-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>One of the best courses that I have ever taken .

It describes the kind of biases in thinking that you cannot discover on your own. Knowing how these thought processes operate gives you with a much keener perspective on what's happening around you, why much of it is that way, and how to deal with it. Furthermore, the videos (basically conversations with experts in field) are well presented and enjoyable to watch.</review><course_id>36404</course_id><course_title>The Science of Everyday Thinking</course_title><reviewer_id>35849</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-06-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Very informative and engaging.

The conversational format and the various locations of the videos, the sequence in which the material was presented, the Learn More section, and the interviews with experts all combined to make this an extremely enjoyable learning experience. The topic was fascinating and I feel that I learned a great deal about my own and other's thinking. As someone who has been out of school for 40+ years the Learning to Learn episode was especially valuable because so much has changed. I loved every minute of this course and found myself looking forward to each week's lesson.

It is getting more interesting towards the end. Although i am towards my 50's, i learned a lot and hopefully improved my everyday thinking. The improvement came from two ways: In some areas, the scientific studies presented by the course helped me to clear the foggy vision i had. In some other areas i learned new concepts i was not aware of.

Others are diatribes against chiropractic care (a theme that the teachers revisit in at least 3 lessons) The quiz structure features too many of the several-answers-are-correct type. Multiple choice quizzes are poor assessment tools to begin with and when they are poorly written, they become irritating. All-in-all, I took this class to learn something and I did learn new things. I highly suggest that the class concentrate on thinking and that the anti-chiropractic discourse be removed from future editions of this class.</review><course_id>36404</course_id><course_title>The Science of Everyday Thinking</course_title><reviewer_id>35762</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-06-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This has been a real eye opening fun fantastic course.

Major topics include illusions and cognitive biases, intuition, learning, experimentation, belief and how scientific thinking can improve decisions. The course consists of 12 modules that each focus on a particular theme with a series of video lectures interspersed with interviews of experts. Each section concludes with a 10-question quiz, an invitation to participate in the discussion forums and a video showing some of the work of on-campus students. The course videos are well done, both in terms of content and the quality of the video footage itself. In most MOOCs I find guest lectures to be of little value: they are usually tacked on as bonus content that is not always directly relevant to the main lectures. This is the first MOOC I've seen where guest speakers fit well into the flow of the main lecture content and enhance the overall course experience. On the downside, I did not care for the quizzes because they ask too many questions that require you to remember specific lines, facts or definitions from the lecture videos. I also felt that the course tapers off a bit at the end: the final 4 weeks were not quite as interesting as the first 8. Still, the science of everyday thinking is a very good course that provides interesting insights into the human thought process without a major time commitment.</review><course_id>36404</course_id><course_title>The Science of Everyday Thinking</course_title><reviewer_id>34641</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-06-06</review_date><review_value>5</review_value><review>This course will change the way you comprehend the world .

Sequenceing is logical, various learning techniques are utilised, quality of the videos is superbe, conversations and interviews are easy to follow yet very informative ... and much more. The only part to be improved: the discussion forum, which is not used to full extent, mainly just to show mere responses to the dicussion questions. Participation in the dicussion forum seems to be a burden for many, something "you have to do" to obtain a certificate. Yet overall a five star course.</review><course_id>36404</course_id><course_title>The Science of Everyday Thinking</course_title><reviewer_id>30906</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-05-06</review_date><review_value>1</review_value><review>Is it just me, or am I completely missing something here? There are people actively reviewing the course and its content, but how on earth are they seeing anything if there is no access to the class? I must confess, my first blush with edX isn't as enjoyable as my classes have been with Coursera. Perhaps there needs to be some sort of better communication as to when the class actually opens (give a specific time, regardless of what time zone, and not just a date)? Or an email sent out to students who are enrolled so they know when class is truly in session? I get that this class is being offered in an "experimental format" but so far, it's more like a gong show and not a class.</review><course_id>36404</course_id><course_title>The Science of Everyday Thinking</course_title><reviewer_id>30768</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-05-05</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Fun course, could have had more depth, but very entertaining and informative for most students.

Some edX courses are difficult to sit and concentrate on, either because the level of information I have to digest is too much for my schedule…or sometimes, I just get disinterested. I've been particularly busy with my personal schedule lately, but I don't want to give up on finishing this class. I love the videos, I'm fascinated by the studies &amp; guest interviews, and I find myself really wanting to learn and hear what new topic they will discuss next.

They are very well-organized and wonderfully arranged for both online and offline classes equally. Thus, even I've been taking this course online through edX but I really feel like I am with them in UQ. It is just like a well-made documentary from National Geographic Channel so often I had a feeling like that I am not just taking a course of a University but I feel like to joyfully watch a good knowledge documentary of a TV program.

I love the examples but sometimes I'd like the content to be shorter and denser, as well as having more everyday concrete examples. It could be even better if there were a kind of summary at the end of each course, catching the key concepts seen in the chapter, that we could access after taking the quizz (which does that as well, but in a less formal summary-like way). Congrats anyway I can't wait for the next episodes.</review><course_id>36404</course_id><course_title>The Science of Everyday Thinking</course_title><reviewer_id>29704</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-04-21</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>very beautiful narration and awesome experience learning , as far as MOOCs are concerned very engaging and easy to follow .

It has also been fascinating to me to know the discussions are from all over the world from a wide variety of worldviews. I haven't had much experience on other courses but this has been a really good one from my limited experience. Despite all the work done on biases, I don't think the added awareness is going to stop us having them, not at the deeper level where it really matters anyway. I think we really need outside help for those, but there really isn't much I don't like about this course.</review><course_id>36404</course_id><course_title>The Science of Everyday Thinking</course_title><reviewer_id>29204</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-04-21</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Extremely well produced and engaging videos.

I've taken a number of courses at both Coursera and edX. Think 101 has given me a lot to think about (duh). But seriously, I love the way Jason Tangen and Matthew Thompson keep you engaged in the material they present. The guest lecturers are tops and I like getting a glimpse of a real class. I keep having information from the class pop into my thinking during the day. I think I am more aware of how people (including myself) are rational or irrational. Knowing the difference helps me make better informed choices in my life. I recommend this MOOC to everybody!!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>36404</course_id><course_title>The Science of Everyday Thinking</course_title><reviewer_id>29163</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-04-20</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>We don't realize the complexity of everyday thinking until you go through this course.

Most current MOOC offerings based on R are Statistics or Data Analysis courses where R is just the computational tool of choice. In such courses formal and systematic introduction to R is not provided. An exception is the JHU 'R Programming' course, definitely oriented toward the language itself. However the JHU course requires programming background and is actually fast-paced, it also assumes that students are capable to fill gaps on their own when needed. DAT204x is like 'R Programming' in that it's only interested in the language. Unlike 'R Programming', though, it doesn't require programming background. The goal is not to teach R programming, but rather to teach in a gentler manner R essentials. The subject is organized around the basic R data structures: atomic vectors, matrices, factors, lists, and data frames. A last module on graphics (with base R) can be considered as an appetizer to get a minimal familiarity with the powerful support provided by R regarding graphics. Weekly modules consist of a series of short lectures, quizzes (intended to test the understanding of lecture materials) and short Labs to put in practice what has been learned. Labs are to be done on the excellent DataCamp interface, a well-known and well-regarded platform for R training, which free students from installing R or RStudio on their machines. Materials are very well design to fulfill the main objective. In my opinion, this is actually the most remarkable feature of the course. R is a peculiar language. A sound foundation onto R data structures can avoid annoying problems in the future. Going directly to data frames without having a sufficient knowledge of vectorized operations, different ways of indexing (including indexing via logical vectors and indexing over lists), factors, automatic coercion, etc. is not the way to learn R. Obviously, R is much more than its data structures and I hope future courses that complete the whole picture. I highly recommend this course as a sound first course on R for non-programmers.</review><course_id>46985</course_id><course_title>Introduction to R Programming</course_title><reviewer_id>112017</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-08-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>A very great course to start R programming!

I highly recommend it to anyone willing to get acquainted with R, or in need of a refresher. The exercises are not very engaging, since they consist mostly in direct applications of the material. I think that's what they are supposed to be. Functions are introduced implicitly. Since functions are so paramount in R, they may deserve a quick introduction of their own. All in all, the course does precisely (and well) what it purports to do : introduce to the R language — not to data analysis nor computer programming.</review><course_id>46985</course_id><course_title>Introduction to R Programming</course_title><reviewer_id>112190</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-08-30</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Very good introduction to the R language.

The basics of R are taught from the very beginning, so it's ideal for people who are as new to R as they are to programming. More seasoned coders will probably prefer to look somewhere else. Don't expect being able to code full programs after doing this course, but you will get a thorough introduction (with very well designed practical exercises) to the basic -and most used- commands of R.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>46985</course_id><course_title>Introduction to R Programming</course_title><reviewer_id>120227</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-04-11</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Excellent course for the beginners. well structured content.Nice platform to learn R programming ,,,Nicely organized lab and quiz sessions to improve the knowledge.</review><course_id>46985</course_id><course_title>Introduction to R Programming</course_title><reviewer_id>120219</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-04-10</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>It is great beginner course to understand the basics of R!

The review questions are so-so, but the labs are excellent and complement the videos well. I thought a few lecture review questions should be worded better. I also wished that the videos had presented the technical side a little more and sooner in the course. Often, we do not get an explanation of why we must follow a certain syntax other than this is just how it is. For example, how we use = to specify an argument and how this is different from &lt;- for assignment (the command rm(list = ls()) may not make sense given the things we know from the first chapter), and how we can use ? to ask R for help on using a routine (the ? wasn't presented and used in labs until the very last chapter on graphing).

Lab assignments are my favorite part: they are interesting, detailed and often straightforward enough that you don't have to scratch your head reading the instruction. Their built-in R environment means you don't have to worry about particulars of R installation or that you might be using a different version than instructor/other students. One minor flaw is that they don't have an exam at the end of the course to test all the concepts you've learned in the course. This is the first MOOC of this kind (provided not by a college, but by a company or an institution) I have taken and I am impressed.</review><course_id>46985</course_id><course_title>Introduction to R Programming</course_title><reviewer_id>115464</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-12</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I highly recommend this course for anyone getting started with R.

The course builds upon the prior chapters and teaches you through a series of easy-to-apply exercises. Some of the other R classes I took would just simply lay out one concept and move to the other one. I would often be asking myself what I really learned, where I was and how and why it all mattered. So being able to apply the concepts through the mini-exercises was great. My only reservation is related to the grading of the problems. Often times (as a fairly unexperienced R user) I would get to the right answer, but my path would be longer, take more intermediate steps or variables. So my final outcome would be correct, but I would still get no credit for the problem. Overall, I think the Datacamp guys did an awesome job.</review><course_id>46985</course_id><course_title>Introduction to R Programming</course_title><reviewer_id>114697</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-10-24</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course was very well structured, the content was well planned, the quizzes were very well composed, asking things that a learner was most likely to gloss over (I had to even re-watch the video lectures sometimes) and the lab exercises helped in learning concepts that seem daunting to a beginner.

The experience and exposure to Programming and computer science that this course gave me was phenomenal: from the instructor, to the handouts, to the "Lab Exercises"; everything in the syllabus was well structured and thought out so that the content was not too easy nor too overwhelming. The aspect of this course that i loved best were the interactive lab exercises(these are called "problem sets" on most other courses) on the DataCamp which were extremely fun even though they were challenging. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone looking for a great introduction into the wonderful statistical programming language called R</review><course_id>46985</course_id><course_title>Introduction to R Programming</course_title><reviewer_id>112404</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-09-01</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Really good course allowing you to get a good grasp of the basics of R.

The videos, quizzes and labs are organized into well thought out chunks that build on the knowledge and don't feel too heavy or light. The best part is that there is no installation of R IDE or software and the entire experience is browser based and I was able to pick up from where I left, regardless of whether I was logging in from office or home. The labs work well, but sometimes the automatic grader is a little quirky in how it assesses results, all told a great pathway into a prized field and I am glad to have completed this for a verified certificate.</review><course_id>46985</course_id><course_title>Introduction to R Programming</course_title><reviewer_id>112378</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-09-01</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>This is a great course.

It is a vast improvement on other R courses geared towards beginners, at least. The course was not at a breakneck pace, where your focus became more on meeting a weekly deadline instead of actually learning the material. You was not presented with an over abundance of information, 15 lecture videos per lecture, that leads to information overload, and not retaining what you are suppose to learn. Datacamp is an awesome learning environment, but there is always room for improvement. The auto-grading process becomes a frustrating guessing game, lost of data when having to constantly refresh the datacamp console when if get's stuck loading results, and only copying and pasting reproducible documents and when data is not provided for download. Beyond that, this was an awesome course, i learned and relearned a lot about R capabilities. I hope an intermediate course will be followed up in this same vein..</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>46985</course_id><course_title>Introduction to R Programming</course_title><reviewer_id>112341</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-09-01</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>i had a wonderful time learning this course! definitely lots to learn and a skill which are of an asset to have at this time.

I saw a comment about Coursera's class that I felt was true: They give you a five minute explanation on how to swim, then throw you in expecting you to survive. This class explained how to swim, sat with you as you practiced your newly learned strokes, helped you clarify what you didn't quite understand, and eased you into the deep end. This is a very very excellent class and I only hope there are more to come. I am between jobs now (I was laid off as a Database Administrator) so I don't know if I'll use R in my next job.

I enjoyed the classes and exercises from day1. All the classes and exercises are very well organised. Luckily, I never encountered some of the problems with browser and scores as mentioned by some students on the forum. I have enrolled and unenrolled in other R courses offered by other MOOCs but this is the best. I am excited that I could pass the course with 98% and will be receiving my first verified certificate. I am looking forward to take more courses on datacamp and I thank Filip, Jonathan, atopos and edX team for putting forward such a great intro course.

Gets you introduced into R the way an introductory course should. Simple by taking it one step and command at a time, without going into too much detail. The only issue was that some questions in the lab weren't really expressed in a way to help you understand what was being asked. But this is just a minor flaw.

The exercises are a bit easy, but given the course level, they get you to the intended level of knowledge. Instructions are to the point, no excentric or off-topic examples to confuse your learning experience. All in all, this is, in my opinion, a course that must be taken by anyone that is starting in data science. Of corse there is much more to R, but we have to begin somewhere, and DAT204x is a very gentle first step.</review><course_id>46985</course_id><course_title>Introduction to R Programming</course_title><reviewer_id>112078</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-08-28</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>The course content is great for beginners, appropriately pitched for those of us without background in programming.

This is actually the 3rd basic R programming course I've taken online, the first was downright terrible, the second was just too demanding for people with no experience, and this one was the "Baby Bear" of the 3 - just right! I sincerely hope Microsoft and datacamp team up again and offer the intermediate course here on edx.org, I'll sign up for it immediately - and if not, I think I'll have to get an account on their website and keep going through the rest of the courses they offer.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>46985</course_id><course_title>Introduction to R Programming</course_title><reviewer_id>111974</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-08-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Very nice introduction to R.

Most other courses on R were loaded with jargon and quite intimidating. The other courses covered much more ground in a similar time period as well. The pace and content were just right. I was able to complete modules without over-stretching myself- in previous courses I dropped out as I was unable to devote enough time due to work pressures. That all labs were due on September 1st also helped reduce anxiety. Overall, I learnt a lot.

Most things very quite obvious and thus easy to do. Unfortunately there where some things they considered too obvious in some exercises so didn't even bother mentioning them, which gave many people a hard time.

The way it addresses each of the issues, which have very interesting interviews. Each theme puts you new challenges, you can access all the information that is provided through the links provided. Small questionnaires that arise at the end of each topic or end of each workweek are very good because they allow us to see which subject we lacked a better understanding and thus focus on it. Discussion forums are an important tool because they allow connecting with different people from different parts of the world and everyone with a very particular point of view, this way you can exchange experiences. I personally would have liked a little more than deepen the issue of global warming which is having major effects on our planet and in our daily lives.

The only way to change the world we are living in for the better is to be aware of what needs to be changed- and this course specialized in that! Although some facts were hard to hear, i knew the knowledge would only help me and inspire me to spread my knowledge and make a change. I'm proud to say I am completely obsessed with environmental science and desire to get a major in it when I go to college which is coming soon. This class was my answer to what I want to do in my life. Thank you!

I graduated quite a while ago so the field has changed substantially, but the variety of topics covered was good. It took time and concentration, but given that I work full time and have a family I was glad it was not too challenging to allow me to complete it. This was my first MOOC and I was favorably impressed. Definitely the field trips added to the experience, even if the dialogue was sometimes a bit goofy. It was good to see ENVS theories in action and have a change of presenter. I will take more classes and definitely recommend this one!</review><course_id>36320</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Environmental Science</course_title><reviewer_id>73618</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-03-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Great course!!

On-site field trips and locations used as backdrops facilitated down-to-earth, rather than purely theoretical, understanding of the material. Quizzes and self-check questions served to reinforce learning, and prompted discussions were designed to help the student relate topics to his/her own life.

Highly recommend this to anyone wanting to get their feet wet and gain some practical knowledge of environmental science. The course moved through each section smoothly and just enough time was provided to go through each section. It was interesting to read student feedback as students were from around the world and from different walks of life. More people need to complete this course. I already had an interest in environmental science but taking this course has armed me with the language to talk to others about these very important issues. The practical knowledge I’ve gained through the course will be useful to me as I move toward a more environmentally efficient lifestyle.

I think the course provided insight into the world of environmental science, and without hysteria, provided the message that our environment can be studied and understood. I knew of global warming, but not of the breakdown of the different greenhouse gasses and how they are generated. I knew sea levels were rising, but not that it was from land ice melting and the expansion of the sea from temperature increase.

CO2, while providing an intellctual discussion, is less of an environmntl problem than pm2.5, o3, and hg are.

Unfortunately, this negative impact in some way influences on global warming. I initially begins by analyzing my diet which consists mainly by industrial agro products that use a large amount of fertilizers and oxidizers. If I take for example the products exhibited in the super markets besides soft and alcoholic drinks. Nowadays it is very difficult for people who live in cities do not use energy, regardless of its source and the use they have made. I personally, as a journalist (video producer) I use energy at least 15 hours a day which is quite normal because my business depends. Apart from my personal activities at home such as: Radio, TV, AC, Microwave, Refrigerator etc. I use energy 24 hours a day to run my studio and keep the units has a constant temperature because I live in a tropical country it is very hot. As is usually the case, I often moves me to cover events, this requires that uses one or two vehicles that emit at least 2/3 of CO2. With this in mind, I begin to consider alternatives to help me change my lifestyle. Anyway it's not too easy when you live in an underdeveloped country like Haiti with very limited resources. I intend to base myself on many good experiences already in the works in countries like India in order to reduce my negative impact on global warming.</review><course_id>36320</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Environmental Science</course_title><reviewer_id>73462</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-03-15</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Je ne pensais jamais que comportement avait un impact direct sur l’environnement. Cet impact malheureusement négatif influence en quelque sorte sur le réchauffement de la planète. Je commence tout d’abord par analyser mon régime alimentaire qui est constitué en majeure partie par des produits agro industriels qui utilisent une très grande quantité de fertilisants et d’oxydants. Si je prends par exemple les produits exposés dans les super marchés sans compter les boissons gazeuses et alcoolisés. De nos jours il est très difficile pour les gens qui habitent dans les villes de ne pas utiliser de l’énergie, peu importe sa source et l’usage qu’ils en ont fait. Moi personnellement, en tant que journaliste (vidéo Producer) j’utilise de l’énergie au moins 15 heures par jour qui est tout a fait normale puisque mes activités en dépendent. A part mes activités personnelles a la maison par exemple : Radio, TV, AC, Microwave, Refrigerator etc, j’utilise de l’énergie 24 heures par jour pour faire fonctionner mon studio et garder les appareils a une température constante parce que je vis dans un pays tropical il fait très chaud. Comme c’est le plus souvent le cas, je me déplace souvent pour couvrir des événements, cela nécessite qu’on utilise un ou deux véhicules qui émettent au moins 2/3 de CO2. Fort de ce constat, je commence à envisager des alternatives pouvant m’aider à modifier mon style de vie. De toute manière ce n’est pas trop facile lorsqu’on vit dans un pays sous développé comme Haïti avec des ressources très limitées. Je compte me baser sur plusieurs bonnes expériences déjà mises en œuvres dans des pays comme l’Inde afin de pouvoir réduire mon impact négatif sur le réchauffement de la planète.</review><course_id>36320</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Environmental Science</course_title><reviewer_id>73459</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-03-15</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I can get a lots of knowledge and perspective from this course.

The topics were all extremely interesting and they highlighted many different issues. This course has really changed my perspective on Earth and on what we can do NOW in order to change this dramatic scenario. I'd like to learn more, to study more about Environmental Science, and I would certainly follow other courses. A ENVX 2 is needed, because this course was wonderful and well-structured. Moreover, it gave us the great opportunity to get in contact with one of the best American colleges and to get closer to U.S. education, which is unique.

However, the assessments were terrible. It consisted of nuanced multiple choice question with __no coding__. Completing the "suggested" coding projects in no way helped with answering these assessments as most were esoteric questions from the documentation. I saw through the discussion boards many people felt the same and just dropped the course. I'm just one of those stubborn people that like to finish what I start.

The instructor does his job. I just don't like the presentation. Instead of feeling stimulated by the information I feel frustration. I don't think it is an interesting presentation of the material and is quite frankly boring. The main reason for this is that most of the content in week 1 is not displayed in videos. I think it is very interesting to learn about how to make the web more accessible. I just wish it would be fun to do so. But I suppose I am spoiled by interactive websites like codecademy.com and by the formats of other MOOC's like CS50x here on Edx or Rice University's Interactive Python, or Michigan State's programming for Everybody in Python.

Knowing that there is a way to make every single component accessible to screen-readers and how to design very limited layout just to address several kinds of cognitive disabilities and similar use cases is pointless for most of HTML5 interfaces.</review><course_id>45260</course_id><course_title>HTML5 Part 1: HTML5 Coding Essentials and Best Practices</course_title><reviewer_id>116515</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-12-08</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>amazing course very recommended for everyone. also the exercises are very good. you should take this course for sure.</review><course_id>45260</course_id><course_title>HTML5 Part 1: HTML5 Coding Essentials and Best Practices</course_title><reviewer_id>116514</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-12-08</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Amazing course, very recommended for everyone ,it is one of the best html course i have ever taken but you need to apply a lot and practice on the optional projects at the end of every section</review><course_id>45260</course_id><course_title>HTML5 Part 1: HTML5 Coding Essentials and Best Practices</course_title><reviewer_id>116273</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-12-01</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is a great course. It has just the right amount of information on the new HTML5 elements and attributes to help you get started. On top of that, it has a plethora of links to external resources on each topic for those who wish to learn more. Not all of the lessons are accompanied by videos. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. I, personally, prefer text-based classes because it's easier to go back and search for some concept by just using the browser's search bar. That's simply not possible with videos. On top of that, I'm sure you will love Mr Buffa's awkward sense of humor. On another note, I have to agree with some of the other reviewers who say that the assessments are too easy.</review><course_id>45260</course_id><course_title>HTML5 Part 1: HTML5 Coding Essentials and Best Practices</course_title><reviewer_id>116096</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Thoroughly enjoyed the course. Michel has been very active in the Discussion areas ensuring that we trainees gain full 'value' from our efforts, sorting-out misunderstandings, helping with practical work, etc; whereas in (too) many of the MOOCs I've attended, trainees were left-alone to sink-or-swim or abandoned in to the hands of "TAs" who lacked consistency with the course materials. Not only learned new material but was 'forced' to consider areas which seemed less relevant at first glance. Material is presented in logical sequence and with humor. Plenty of references to external materials. Good choice of tools, particularly to develop solutions, share them with others, and to be able to seek assistance. This is a practical course. Offered in a practical manner. Highly recommended!

The instructional materials are designed in a way that is engaging and very clear to understand. As a complete beginner I found the course challenging as there was a lot of information to assimilate in a short period of time but at the same time the course provided me with the opportunity to do plenty of exercises, to see others exercises, review and design my own. This helped me to understand the new concepts. I can say I gained many skills and strengthen many others. The best? Not only the course is well structured, but the Instructor Michel Buffa is the best teacher you can imagine, it is possible to "see" how much he likes what he does, how much he cares, he is a 'natural born" teacher, additionally his videos are easy to follow and I was amazed he personally motivates you even if this is a cyber space. I am very thankful and ready to continue the next course.</review><course_id>45260</course_id><course_title>HTML5 Part 1: HTML5 Coding Essentials and Best Practices</course_title><reviewer_id>116005</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-23</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review># Strengths: The strength of this course lies in the live examples given (in JSBin, codepen, etc), live coding videos, optional projects, and extremely helpful instructor. You will know good coding practices and web resources even beyond course materials. The optional project, even though not graded, is where you really learned a lot, since you have to figure out how things work and code them your own. In these projects you can discuss your coding problems and somebody, especially the instructor, will lend help. # Limitations: The course will not teach you how to code (as in other similar courses). It assumes you already have working knowledge/skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript (hence the Intermediate requirement) that you are expected to work autonomously. In plenty of APIs work, JavaScript is inevitable; I suggest you prepare your JavaScript skills for more benefits from the course. The course moves in fast-pace, I couldn’t submit all the optional projects within the time frame. It also lacks references to real-world industrial-scale examples on where HTML5 elements are being used. Such as, who incorporate Canvas element into their web design or apps? Which web sites stream videos with WebVTT? etc. I understand that there is no limit to our imagination but these kind of examples do help a lot.</review><course_id>45260</course_id><course_title>HTML5 Part 1: HTML5 Coding Essentials and Best Practices</course_title><reviewer_id>115946</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-22</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Awesome MOOC!

The assignments were probably a bit too easy, and answers sometimes obvious. The course seemed a bit too rushed for 6 weeks, and could function better if it was stretched to 8-10 weeks. Loved the games and projects, but these were facultative, and few people had time for that. Quizzes were perhaps too easy even if you didn't go through the lectures, but the material itself is quite difficult if there's no prior JS knowledge. It could function better if the series was joined with a JS intro (although, if you have previous experience, it should be easy). Codebin examples were nice, but we spent a little time coding and much time on theoretical background, perhaps there should be an equal amount of theory and practice, and introduce these facultative projects as peer-reviewed ones. It's a nice course, but it seems less like a course, more like an interactive version of w3c.org.</review><course_id>45260</course_id><course_title>HTML5 Part 1: HTML5 Coding Essentials and Best Practices</course_title><reviewer_id>115466</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-12</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Amazing course!</review><course_id>45260</course_id><course_title>HTML5 Part 1: HTML5 Coding Essentials and Best Practices</course_title><reviewer_id>115434</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-11</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course is surprisingly good, the materials are presented in a very organized fashion and the instructor was great.

Just an idea: many students from a developing countries can't afford to pay $99 for a certified course, but what could edex perhaps do is to partner up with a businesses and nonprofits worldwide that need web design or redesign work. Students who come up with the best solutions (code) for the business will be rewarded with an official verified certificate paid by those same businesses. It could be a win win situation for all: Students getting a real hands on experience and a chance to work with a real life business and plus a verified certificate; Businesses for getting a very cheap good quality code and boost in social responsibility department; Edx and its tutors would get paid for their time and effort....

There was a good amount of material each week. Except for the last week, each topic had good practice questions. Each week had an exercises to check understanding and the last week added some questions from past weeks. I liked that there were a mix of multiple choice, true/false and fill in the blanks. I was happy to see that this course was fully accessible. The text of the videos was prominently featured next to them. There was almost lots of text below each so I chose to use that more than the videos. I wish I had more time to participate tin the discussion forums.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45496</course_id><course_title>Transforming Business, Society, and Self with U.Lab</course_title><reviewer_id>115780</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is a must of our times.

For last year’s session, there were about 10,000 participants, and often as many as 6,000 participants in the live sessions, which were real time tweeted. Conversations and meditation and connection actually happened during the live events. Think about it - conversations, meditation and connection between 6,000 different people from, and in, 182 countries. Simultaneously. And yes, it was as amazing as it sounds. During the six weeks of participation, I felt like I was cocooned in a world of those who want to make a difference, those who want to see a more just world, a more verdant world and a more generative, giving world. If you have any interest in these areas and have 2 – 5 hours to spend each week for the next several weeks, I strongly recommend taking part in this potentially life-changing, no-cost opportunity.</review><course_id>45496</course_id><course_title>Transforming Business, Society, and Self with U.Lab</course_title><reviewer_id>119224</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-03-09</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The most effective part of the program has been establishing connections with other people worldwide and having the opportunity to discuss not only the content, but our lives and how we live them.

For anyone who considers themselves to be a change maker, whether in business, in your community or within NGO's. I would make a special recommendation to you if you work within the education, government or healthcare sectors. This course exceeded my expectations in that it successfully brings forth the methods for action and integration post learning. This is something I often find to be amiss in most courses. It therefore promises sustainability and results. It's the perfect method and direction to adopt, to completely transform your way of working and communicating with others. It ignited the creative fire within me, allowed the space within which to see my vision clearly and has taught me a new, intelligent language of connecting to others. A connection that is deeper, more relevant and develops real solutions. An absolute MUST!

The content, readings, videos, and support materials that this course offers are well thought, well researched, very moving and nicely integrated with the U.Lab philosophy. The revolutionary concept of the U Theory has been brought by Otto Scharmer and the U.Lab team to a technology for social change that aims to the transformation of the world's future. Nothing less than that. However, that technology surprises by its practicality and the courses emphasises the learning by doing of the Ulabers. I want to express my appreciation to the U. Lab team for giving me and other 40.000 like minded Ulabers the opportunity to have participated in this experience, that for me is life changing.

The course touches subjects that inspire, for it invites us to first look inside ourselves, then observe the world around us and finally act upon that which we feel our heart wants to help with - not only as individuals but as a collectivity.

Todos escuchamos todo el tiempo, pero lo hacemos instintivamente. Al integrar un método, somos conscientes de nuestros errores, de los "ruidos" que se interponen entre nosotros y los demás, de los grados de profundidad que requiere escuchar profundamente a nuestro entorno. Esto nos permite dominar nuestra manera de escuchar, mejorarla, ponernos de manera profunda y sistemática en el lugar de aquellos que son distintos y con quienes, sin embargo debemos lograr convivir por el bien del conjunto de nuestra sociedad y de las generaciones que vendran.

U-Labs builds on MITs great tradition of organisational development – but with a step change – Otto Scharmer’s Theory U gets right to the core of our real problems – humanity’s disconnect with ourselves, our society and our planet. It exposes the toxic bubbles we’ve created and tracks the cause to its source – our blind spot, consciousness itself. From this spot, Theory U builds a picture of how an increasingly aware humanity can build the resilient and sustainable solutions we need in every area of life. And U-Labs provides a rich toolkit for participants to structure these solutions in their lives, their enterprises and societies. I work now in a social enterprise incubator in Bristol, and 20 people joined the course here, creating a real buzz. U-Labs is becoming an operating system (uOS?) for innovation hubs, resulting in transformation of communities – rather than ‘just’ more growth for corporations. The course text ‘Leading from the Emerging Future’ is a clear guide to our problems, and the steps to the solution. And the course helps individuals and groups structure these steps. Theory U is a huge synthesis – and U-Labs makes it practical. It’s hard to imagine anything more positive for humanity, or to recommend it highly enough...</review><course_id>45496</course_id><course_title>Transforming Business, Society, and Self with U.Lab</course_title><reviewer_id>115649</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is the first time I have taken a MOOC.

Breadth of vision, care and deep preparation is evident in all the materials. These are folk who 'talk their walk'. The materials and the approach encourage a reflective and engaged approach to personal and professional development. There is a continual focus on how we connect with our work and with the world. I have known and worked with these ideas for a while, but the course helped me deepen, strengthen and extend my understanding. For me, it worked well having local hubs where we could practise the skills and learn from each other. This course has helped me hone my plans for my 'true work' and to consider deeply what I need to learn and let go of in a continual conversation between myself and the world. I am deeply appreciative and recommend this course to anyone willing to shift your ways of being and working, to listen to what is emerging in your life and co-create your future with others and with the world.</review><course_id>45496</course_id><course_title>Transforming Business, Society, and Self with U.Lab</course_title><reviewer_id>115416</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-11</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Exceptional design and implementation!

Brain and Paul are great teachers and listening to them speak about the universe was really enjoyable. However the math required to complete this is beyond me and I would need to be in a classroom to ask questions and receive help face to face. Its very disappointing I had to drop this course because the universe is something which keeps me up at night and wanting to learn more is a passion for me. This course should have some more details or examples of the work required because it would be better to know that it would be quite difficult and beyond my level beforehand rather than me having to stop it which is quite demotivating and disheartening.</review><course_id>34642</course_id><course_title>Greatest Unsolved Mysteries of the Universe</course_title><reviewer_id>115590</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-15</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>It's fun and awesome.

The instructors were fun, engaging, and clear (most of the time). And if you were confused, you could post your questions, and have them answered by other students, course staff, or even the instructors, who were always gracious and open-minded, even when students were criticizing them. They even had a special overlay, a "mystery" which was great fun and gave the students who already knew much of the material something to play with, and the rest of us something to wonder at. In the end, though, you only needed the material presented in the videos and exercises to pass the class. Some of the exercises were devilish, because the idea was to get you to think like an astrophysicist, but they were always do-able in the end. I cannot recommend this class enough!</review><course_id>34642</course_id><course_title>Greatest Unsolved Mysteries of the Universe</course_title><reviewer_id>36227</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-06-23</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I am a matured student, a financial professional who had successfully completed the course ANU-ASTRO1x. My engagement in amateur Astronomy and the thirst for knowledge, especially astrophysics made me take up this fine course. Early studies in engineering I had given up halfway helped me to easy understanding of the subject matter and try to go a bit deeper when required. The course was conducted in an excellent manner. The simulated universe, as intended, gave us an exposure to an environment of scientific research. A successful approach to teaching of subjects that hangs at the very edge of knowledge, the student was drawn into the core of the subject matter as a silent participant to a conversation between eminent scientists, To Dr. Paul Francis and Dr. Brian Schmidt, and to their support staff, whose interest, care and dedication had made our studies a very pleasant, memorable experience for years to come, we are greatly and gratefully indebted. The decision not to mention the passing grade in the certificate, however, is regrettable. In my opinion, it constitute a negative incentive for all to do their best and especially seriously counterproductive in diluting the interests of the budding scientists among the young students to strive hard.

Much more deeply rewarding than watching Cosmos or reading popular books on cosmology. You really get to sink your teeth into black holes, the expansion of space-time, the Big Bang, supernovae and more. You also can taste what it is like to do science, through trying to solve a wonderfully crafted mystery about the structure of an alternative universe.

It is rather lightweight (if you have some basic knowledge of math and some average knowledge of physics - your mileage may vary though). You can either view just the videos and treat it as a documentary that goes deeper in detail than the ones you see on tv, or try to do the exercises &amp; homeworks (in which case it takes about a couple of hours per week - maybe a little bit more if your physics is rusty) The main selling point for this course is the chemistry between Paul &amp; Brian and the way the explain really interesting problems in a very simple and understandable way. They simplify the problems enough so that they avoid complex math, but they don't oversimplify them so that you still get the big picture. Compared with other online courses I have taken this was by far the most enjoyable &amp; fun.

It answered quite a few things I was interested in learning, such as how do we know the mass of the universe, its age, how did the original elements form, what were the stages of universal expansion, what is the future, what is dark matter and dark energy and how do we know it exists, etc. The course takes a fair amount of time and effort. There is quite a lot of math - high school level but a bit complex at times, especially if you haven't done this type of math in a long time, so you may have a re-learning curve. But I would definitely recommend this course. Both Paul Francis and Brian Schmidt are excellent teachers and their taking time to do these lectures is a real valuable gift to anyone who wishes to devote themselves to this work.</review><course_id>34642</course_id><course_title>Greatest Unsolved Mysteries of the Universe</course_title><reviewer_id>35329</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-06-14</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Why, what and were are we?

The "mystery universe" included in the curriculum is a great way to learn what it must be like to research the complete unknown and to apply what we learned in the class by solving the mystery. Some of the students really got deep into solving the mystery.

You try to stop the car, press the break, to your astonishment it did not work, you keep on trying again and again, otherwise these workers will surely die, but it's of no use. So, you feel absolutely desperate. Until, just before you were about to hit the workers. who are absorbed in some repair work and can't hear you screaming, you notice there is another track to the right, which you can turn to, but sadly there seems to be one worker on that side of the track, Will you turn the wheel ?! Is it the right thing to so ?!! In this course we discuss questions of distributive justice, and of moral desert, controversial issues like Military conscription, Affirmative action and Gay marriages. In this course you will read, and understand, Bentham, J Locke, Kant, J Rawls, Aristole and free experts from Micheal Sandal's book. This course is essential for anyone who want to be well-rounded, and think for himself. The course is accessible for anyone who has a good grasp of English language(even if not, check the subtitles option). The lectures are enjoyable and engaging.

While some of the moral dillemas need an effort in abstraction, specially from people coming from a legal profession background as is my case, it makes you feel that you can escape the more commonplace conceptions that tend to dominate ordinary discourse about issues such as affirmative action and military conscription. I enjoyed the course and I would recommend it to people from all backgrounds, as the kind of reflections this course brings can be of use to any kind of professional - specially those that have a say in decision making - which in liberal democratic societies should be all of us.</review><course_id>34704</course_id><course_title>Justice</course_title><reviewer_id>117736</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-01-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>An excellent course! It passes trough a lot of great philosophers and help us to build an understanding of the ways of thinking our society and how it evolved over history.

His lectures are short, precise and clear, even when they leave you questioning your own belief system many times. Thank you to Harvard, edX and Prof. Sandel for this transformative experience. I understand now how little I really understood about justice. This time, I know that it is the process of questioning and going through the "back-and-forth" that we are able to gain an ever-improving notion of justice. The learning never stops. This was a good start.

We skimmed over a bit of Philosophy here and there, as well as Criminal Law, but even though the discussion about what is just or unjust was recurring, I always felt I (and most of my colleagues) needed a bit of solid ground to start from. We often read advanced essays and books and critiques on those, but I always found it hard (for obvious reasons) to critique a theory without having a more solid grasp of the theory itself. In a nutshell, any argument about Justice must take into account what has been already said about the subject throughout human History. I eventually dropped out of Law School, but my curiosity about this subject (to be specific, Political Philosophy), kept growing, and I felt I needed to build some ground before going any further. Harvard's Justice fit my needs perfectly. Sandel's lectures require basically no specific background, being suitable for anyone beginning their studies on Philosophy. The content is presented in a very organized fashion, and you can always clearly see where you came from and where you're going. Besides the lectures, the course has two types of readings: excerpts from Sandel's "Justice: What's the Right Thing to do?" and Philosophy texts. The latter, albeit optional (that is, reading them is not required to pass the course), are at a higher level than the rest of the material: they were mostly written over a hundred years ago, so the language may be an issue at times, and they all delve deeply each into their own subjects, much deeper, doubtlessly, than Sandel's lectures. This brings me to a small problem, so to speak, of the course. If you, like me, pick up Sandel's book at a library or bookstore, you'll find that reading through it won't take you over two weeks, and will give you a very satisfying time. But if you do that, you'll probably find (like me) that watching the lectures becomes a bit pointless: the book and the lectures are way too similar, to the point of Sandel writing/saying some exact same sentences at both of them. Since I read the whole book a bit prior to the course start, that led me to not watch the lectures in full, only a handful of them. Needless to say, the book gives you just as much as the lectures, so you can read it or watch those alternatively and still do well enough in the Quizzes/Final Exam to earn a certificate (I actually only got one question wrong, finishing the whole thing at 96%). In fact, to be honest, it seems to me that the multiple-choice format of testing doesn't work too well for Humanities as it does for Sciences, but this is the kind of trade-off you face when doing online courses: you get a broader audience, but you can only give each person so much attention - computers can't read and analyze written essays (yet), after all.</review><course_id>34704</course_id><course_title>Justice</course_title><reviewer_id>44304</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-01-27</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I passed this class by taking all the tests on the last day of the class and barely looking at the material provided by the course.

He is an outstanding speaker and his enthusiasm held my attention throughout all of the lectures. The course is very polished and well-organized -- much more than any other course I have taken either online or at the University. The course does a great job of explaining basic concepts and also showing real life examples. I have a very strong background in biology but I learned many things I didn't know about the Human Genome Project and the history of genetics. I think anyone involved in teaching biology at any level should take this course for professional development but also for enjoyment and to rekindle your excitement for the subject. It is not an easy course, but if you listen to all the lectures and take all the quizzes before the deadlines you should have no trouble passing - just don't expect to get a perfect score! This is an outstanding course and I have told all my friends how much I enjoyed it.

The course was extremely effective in conveying both the wonder and excitement of the field, and the sometimes difficult technical details. I have taken a number of MOOCs, and this course is way ahead of anything else I've seen. In part, this is due to Professor Lander's great skill and gift for teaching and his position at the leading edge of research in the field. I came away from each lecture feeling inspired and energized - something I haven't encountered since my time at MIT in the late 70s. The excellence of the course is also due to the quality of the supplementary materials, especially the explanatory videos by graduate students and the lab demonstrations. But most surprising to me was how well the online medium has been harnessed in providing tools for learning and skill development as well as in testing in the homework assignments, midterms and final exam. I wonder at the amount of thought and effort that has gone into producing the course. 7.00x demands demands substantial effort and time input, and for someone new to the field, it is difficult. But it delivers the authentic MIT experience.</review><course_id>14099</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Biology - The Secret of Life</course_title><reviewer_id>29857</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-04-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This was the very first course I took on the edX platform, and is the reason why I am now a regular user.

They weren't easy to use. The quiz/exam questions actually quite often didn't seem to go along with the material presented in the lecture.

Scientific learning methods is adopted to enhance the learning process, such as flash cards, interactive genetics "lab" by using VGL, Protein structure display by using JSMOL and etc. Prof Lander is not hurry in flooding us with tons of knowledge but instead, creating an impact (the actual purpose/history of particular area) in our mind prior the insertion of the related knowledge. To me, this has virtually fueled my confidence and passion and I have since can't stop myself trying the quizzes even though they are tough. edX is a great platform but I have dropped my star to 4.5 due to inability to access this course in mobile devices's apps. Hopefully this will be implemented in the future.</review><course_id>14099</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Biology - The Secret of Life</course_title><reviewer_id>113453</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-09-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I can't wait until MIT reopen the course, it's a great introductory course that I would love to have.</review><course_id>14099</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Biology - The Secret of Life</course_title><reviewer_id>113004</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-09-14</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This was the first course I took on edx and I can honestly say it ruined all other courses for me!

The lectures are filmed from the on campus course. The lecturer is phenomenal and the lab/homework unbelievable. This course is rated easy - it is not easy if you do all the homework. I ended up with 83% for the course - the lowest mark I have had on the EdX platform. It isn't the hardest MOOC I have done - that goes to Introduction to Systems Biology on Coursera by Ravi Iyengar I enjoyed the framework used in the course which linked together the 3 strands of biology and added an historical perspective. I have done over 30 MOOCS and this rates in the top 3 - as Professor Landers says this is a dynamic field and you will be learning material that is at the leading edge of what is emerging - be prepared to put in the hours and be fascinated.</review><course_id>14099</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Biology - The Secret of Life</course_title><reviewer_id>41218</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-07-11</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Took this course when it was first offered.

I didn't have a clue on how to do it, this has been the first course I have taken on Android and even then I was able to code the app and get it finished. I mean: from zero to my app!!! To me it's unbelievable and the only explanation is that this course is very, very good. Thanks to all the staff from edX and to professor Morelli. It's been a really good course. I'm just waiting to see if you are going to release more Android courses like this to take them. Thanks again: I hope to see you again soon.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45509</course_id><course_title>Mobile Computing with App Inventor – CS Principles</course_title><reviewer_id>116540</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-12-08</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Excelente recurso y herramienta para el desarrollo de aplicaciones móviles.

Yet I watched almost all videos, did amost all projects and loved it even though I didn't really have the time to do it. I loved it for at least three reasons : 1. A very well paced course, with a well thought progression from easy to more difficult, from theorical to practical. The instructor was just great. 2. Very interesting computer science themes. I especially loved the 4 bit computer part. It helped me understand a lot. The content was great. 3. I learned by doing : Creating the projects along with the instructor was a great way to learn. And when it was time to go by myself for the final project I was suprised by the ease if it. Even if you are not interested in android apps, I would tell you to enroll in this Mooc just to learn about computer science.</review><course_id>45509</course_id><course_title>Mobile Computing with App Inventor – CS Principles</course_title><reviewer_id>116520</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-12-08</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Excellent!

The course deals with more technical aspects of IHR (the various dimensions of discriminations, the notion of absolute rights, etc.) I believe that it provides a good overview of this important topic in international relations and may be useful for the learners in relation to their professional life. As this kind of course is "massive", I consider the involvement and dedication by the instructors (Olivier and Matthias) quite a challenge and I can imagine how difficult it may be to facilitate such a course, with such an amount of learners, with various backgrounds and expectations. I would conclude asking edx to improve the platform, in order to make it more user-friendly and to support better interaction among learners (these long lists of contributions are really hard to read and to analyze). Thank you for this opportunity to know better on IHR and I'm excited to embark other courses on edx.

This was my first MOOC and it couldn´t have been a better experience for me. Make no mistake this course is challenging, especially if you are coming from a non-legal background like myself (I failed the first exam, and quite badly). However, don´t get disheartened if you find the content difficult - one of the things I liked most about this course is that you could really feel your skills and knowledge develop over its duration as you become more familiar with legal language and terminology and more acquainted with the human rights conventions and mechanisms. By the end of the course I was doing much, much better in the exams and was finding the readings a great deal easier. The course covers a lot of ground, but is very well structured and the insights provided by Dr Schutter, the other staff members, the exercises and the course materials is invaluable.

After taking this course it has filled that knowledge gap The course was well- organized and the teaching team showed flexibility, fairness and technical competence by improving the grading system midstream in response to concerns raised by other students. The one concern I have is that it is heavy with reading and light on lectures. I spent far more time on this course than any other MOOC because of all the reading material and you must do the readings to do well on the exams because many questions are based on the readings. In short the course does what it says it will do, it provides a very solid and thorough understanding of the international system for the protection of human rights, but you have to work hard for it.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>34664</course_id><course_title>International Human Rights</course_title><reviewer_id>119966</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-03-31</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>It has been a wonderful experience studying International Human Rights with UCL via Edx.

Mid term was easy it took only 3 hours to solve , Final term is little bit tougher than mid term . You will surely enjoy the discussion forum because of the following reasons. 1\. Your queries are answer by smart students and with new way to think about the problem . 2\. Your ideas will be appreciated if useful. 3\. You will learn new tricks to solve the difficult problems Important points: 1\. As I have read other reviews , people are saying that course involve more mathematics than electronics it is not true , even if you don't understand the mathematics which is not important for the course , you will definitely enjoy building circuits in virtual Lab environment. 2\. They will teach you mathematics part only for 1 or 2 weeks that's it not big deal 3\. Mathematics part only contains how to solve Linear differential equations and they will also teach you to solve differential equations in intuitive way so don't worry and enjoy the course</review><course_id>48839</course_id><course_title>Circuits and Electronics 1: Basic Circuit Analysis</course_title><reviewer_id>435</reviewer_id><review_date>2012-11-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is, hands down, the best on-line course I've taken so far. Maybe it's the first-love effect, since this course first introduced the great interface now being used by edX, or perhaps because I really felt I learned a very difficult load of material driven by the thirst of green ticks. The lectures are long but very interesting and the exercises are challenging and engaging. The provided book is also very good, and a rarity in on-line courses. Finally, the virtual laboratory was just simply great, and the forums even better than the current edX. But the course is not for anyone; there's a lot of math(differential equations), and it takes a lot of work to pass it. Nevertheless, it is definitely worth it and I strongly recommend it with a 5/5.</review><course_id>48839</course_id><course_title>Circuits and Electronics 1: Basic Circuit Analysis</course_title><reviewer_id>1953</reviewer_id><review_date>2013-06-13</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>6.002x will be a classic in the field of online learning.

It was, quite simply, one of the best courses I have ever taken. It was hard work, and very challenging, but because of the care and skill of the instructors, as well as the encouragement of my fellow students on the forum, I was always able to overcome my difficulties and ultimately emerged feeling triumphant. This course requires a significant commitment of time and energy: for me it amounted to about 15hrs per week for 3.5 months. But if you are able to make that commitment, you'll emerge with a good understanding of the basics of circuits and electronics, and hungry for more.</review><course_id>48839</course_id><course_title>Circuits and Electronics 1: Basic Circuit Analysis</course_title><reviewer_id>110859</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-08-06</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Very high quality content.

I wish I could say as much for the way it was administered. I am in the middle of renovating my house and had to stay up very late to get Assignment #2 done in time and did. Because of the two tiered submission system you have, I apparently submitted it to the wrong place. After establishing that you had, in fact, received it--after trying to complete the peer reviews and finding out that Assignment #2 was incomplete--I was then told that I would have to take an incomplete even though the assignment had been submitted in time. I will not be bothering with the rest of the course or any other offerings from your university. Your handling of this has been shameful and I want nothing further to do with your organization.</review><course_id>47058</course_id><course_title>Climate Change: The Science</course_title><reviewer_id>115589</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-15</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>MOOC’s have come a long way since I last used them and this course is the first that will have been worth my while to actually finish. Indeed, the subject matter, course materials, and lecturer are of such high quality, and the seamless use of the edX platform so good—that this rivals most of the real world classes from university I took in terms of how much I have learnt.

This is the first MOOC I have done, and is easily one of the best courses I have ever done. It was more in depth than I expected, so be prepared to devote a large portion of time to this each week. The videos were excellent, very well produced with good graphics, Prof. Slingerland made arcane texts accessible, understandable and relevant to the modern world. I especially like the way it was connected to modern research in psychology, neuroscience and philosophical issues. Each video had a self test quiz to help you embed the things you had just learned, and a quiz at the end of each module, plus an optional peer reviewed assignment which I also completed and enjoyed doing. There were also comprehensive further reading lists and links provided. Prof Slingerland and the teaching team were active on the discussion boards answering questions and Prof Slingerland provided a weekly wrap up video answering questions that had come up in the discussion threads. I looked forward to the new videos being released each week and it was one of those courses that I didn't want to end!</review><course_id>45520</course_id><course_title>Chinese Thought: Ancient Wisdom Meets Modern Science - Part 1</course_title><reviewer_id>61365</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-12-23</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is a superb course from one of the leading experts in the field.

It was the first MOOC I took and it has spoiled me. I have since taken a couple of ChinaX courses through HarvardX and they just don't live up to this one. I really enjoyed Prof. Slingerland's video lectures and the guest lecturers. It was always fascinating and very informative. The videos were very well edited and the pictures and clips inserted during the lectures were very entertaining. The length of Prof. Slingerland's video lectures was perfect. I found other courses' videos that ran in the 2 to 5 minute range to be much too short and chopped up. I found that there were many participants who made very thoughtful and pertinent comments in the discussion boards and the interactive discussions made me feel like a part of the class. Thanks to Prof. Slingerland and team for putting the effort into producing this great course.

After taking this course, I examined similar/other social psychology courses related to the subject of the soul (psyche) and I found they pale in comparison. This course gives a solid, structured treatment of the subject of the soul and related topics, such as evolutionary psychology. Most learners take this course because of an interest in China. My interest, however, is in philosophy and psychology. Overall, I felt that it was worth paying for the verified certificate, and I recommend the course to anyone with an interest in the subject.</review><course_id>45520</course_id><course_title>Chinese Thought: Ancient Wisdom Meets Modern Science - Part 1</course_title><reviewer_id>114642</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-10-22</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>5 Stars! Professor Slingerland is passionate about Chinese history and philosophy. I can even go so far to say he emits 'De' when he lectures. The TAs Robin and Daniel were very helpful in providing clarifications to our questions on the forum. The weekly review of the highlights of the Discussion are definitely a highlight. Even if you are not interested in this course, please check out Prof Slingerland's book, 'Trying not to try' on amazon.

Obviously, a lot of effort went into producing quality, lively lectures. If you have any experience with video production, you will know that that effect takes a lot of effort to achieve. Prof. Slingerland really deserves to be commended for it. This is an introductory course, so if you already have spent some time on these topics, you will probably want a little bit more depth than the course is able to deliver, but there is a rich bibliography section to point you to further reading.</review><course_id>45520</course_id><course_title>Chinese Thought: Ancient Wisdom Meets Modern Science - Part 1</course_title><reviewer_id>114259</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-10-13</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I loved this course.

I have no basis to judge the Chinese scholarship offered here. But the content would be still more riveting (from my perspective) if it explored a few of the fascinating resonances with contemporary management thinking (such as Tom Malone on Collective Intelligence, Ed Schein on Culture, John van Maanen on Organizational Socialization, Donald Schön on Reflective Practice, Pearce and Littlejohn on Moral Conflict, and so on).</review><course_id>45520</course_id><course_title>Chinese Thought: Ancient Wisdom Meets Modern Science - Part 1</course_title><reviewer_id>61157</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-12-08</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course was challenging in that a lot of material was covered (I have exactly 100 pages of notes!) but it was well worth it.

That's all from my end.. best of luck everyone.</review><course_id>45484</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Operations Management</course_title><reviewer_id>113899</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-10-04</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course is very reach in content and the Instructor made it comprehensive with the manner of instruction, illustration, examples, exercises etc. It has helped me in understanding a lot about Operations and has prepared me welĺ for an entrance test for a program i want to do.</review><course_id>45484</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Operations Management</course_title><reviewer_id>113883</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-10-03</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>A course for connecting Academics to industries and Industries to Academics with Latest Trends in Operations Management.

This is the first MOOC I have done, and is easily one of the best courses I have ever done. It was more in depth than I expected, so be prepared to devote a large portion of time to this each week. The videos were excellent, very well produced with good graphics, Prof. Slingerland made arcane texts accessible, understandable and relevant to the modern world. I especially like the way it was connected to modern research in psychology, neuroscience and philosophical issues. Each video had a self test quiz to help you embed the things you had just learned, and a quiz at the end of each module, plus an optional peer reviewed assignment which I also completed and enjoyed doing. There were also comprehensive further reading lists and links provided. Prof Slingerland and the teaching team were active on the discussion boards answering questions and Prof Slingerland provided a weekly wrap up video answering questions that had come up in the discussion threads. I looked forward to the new videos being released each week and it was one of those courses that I didn't want to end!</review><course_id>45521</course_id><course_title>Chinese Thought: Ancient Wisdom Meets Modern Science - Part 2</course_title><reviewer_id>112106</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-12-23</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is a superb course from one of the leading experts in the field.

I came to the course hoping learn more about Laozi and the Daodejing. Overall the course far exceeded my wildest expectations. I loved its depth and the breadth: making complicated things simple without dumbing them down. I only wished the course could have gone on and on. Seven weeks is far too short for such a meaty topic. I have no basis to judge the Chinese scholarship offered here. But the content would be still more riveting (from my perspective) if it explored a few of the fascinating resonances with contemporary management thinking (such as Tom Malone on Collective Intelligence, Ed Schein on Culture, John van Maanen on Organizational Socialization, Donald Schön on Reflective Practice, Pearce and Littlejohn on Moral Conflict, and so on).</review><course_id>45521</course_id><course_title>Chinese Thought: Ancient Wisdom Meets Modern Science - Part 2</course_title><reviewer_id>112102</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-12-21</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Brilliant course taught be a most inspiring professor.</review><course_id>45521</course_id><course_title>Chinese Thought: Ancient Wisdom Meets Modern Science - Part 2</course_title><reviewer_id>112101</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-12-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I had no idea that I would be presented with so much material and that I would be inspired to learn more.

There are already a lot pages on the web, documentation like w3schools, MDV etc., specifications and a mass of blogs for sure but it is rather painful to go through all this. They often come without concrete examples, frequently reflecting personal preferences and just don't give a good, structured overview of all the new tools, apis and features of HTML5. So this is what makes this course so great. It's just goes through all the new stuff. It includes and guides you to put into practice your ideas based on the examples learned in the course. The trainer/coach Michel Buffa is very motivated to help out in the discussion forum and gives good feedback every time someone shares his own examples. That's motivating and fun.

I have been able to discover new aspects of styles I didn't (and in some cases still don't) like at all, but undoubtedly, I understand much better now.

I am a writer, and was suffering from exhaustion. To have this wonderful exposure to jazz music, to be given the opportunity to cross the threshold on which I have hovered for decades, immersion thanks to cerego in the wordless glory of jazz music, was just what I needed. Amazing how that confusing jumble of oft-heard but unrecognizable names and songs, eras and instruments, got teased out and reconstituted into knowledge, thanks to the excellent lectures, and sheer enjoyment of the music thanks to cerego ... I usually chose to listen right through the piece despite recognizing it in the first few seconds.. My course has just finished, and I am plugged into youtube whenever I read emails or write, have just heard through Kind of Blue, and love my Baker and Mulligan, and of course, hard boppers Art Blakey and Horace Silver. Now can add the newer ones to my repertoire, Spalding, Potter, Fusion pianists ... Did I omit Brubeck? Monk? The Duke? And perhaps the most fun of all, Satchmo? I now recognise many of them when Youtube plays on to a random track, what glee! Prof Hellmer's closing sentiment that things learned here can be applied to other musical genres has already come to pass - I am listening to classical music with more focus and recognition. I'll be revisiting cerego for a while - must get all those memories up to level 3! Thanks, prof Hellmer for a gift which will lighten the burdens of old age ... as long as my hearing holds out ...

Their approach is different from other linear algebra courses by sharing MATLAB algorithms that eliminate most of the programming challenges working with matrices - dealing with element indices. They call the approach "slicing and dicing" and it helped work through a lot of problems. Both instructors very responsive to questions posted on discussion board. Both instructors speak clearly in their numerous videos.

I knew linear algebra a bit but did not get time to map it to programming. This course fulfilled that thirst. These are the main points that I want to point out: 1\. Slicing and dicing matrices - Viewing the matrix as a collection of vectors and applying vector operations to matrices made matrix manipulation a lot easier. It not only helped to get insight into the mathematics behind matrix manipulation but also changed the way we write programs for matrix operations. 2\. Extended deadlines: Though at the beginning the course had strict deadlines, realizing that it is delivered online to people with various levels of commitment, deadlines were extended. I think, this is important for such a MOOC, especially a MOOC related to mathematics. This is because mathematics requires (at least for me) a lot of time to understand. It is not the case that you view the videos, review some solved problems, and then go and do the homework. What I found important while doing this course is, if you understand the concept well and if you are able to get insight into it, then it is very easy to solve any problem based upon that topic. For example, if you are able to understand linear transformations, then it is very easy to understand linear dependence and independence which in turn makes it easy to understand orthogonality. It also makes programming easier. 3\. The FLAME library: The algorithms that were discussed in the course helped me to map theory to practice. The best part I liked about the FLAME library is - you have to focus only on the problem at hand i.e. what you want to actually do. Though I never used any math library until now, I think FLAME notation is a revolutionary approach for solving problems related to linear algebra. In short, what I think is, though there are some issues with the course, the content and the approach with which the course is delivered largely outweigh them. ...will be looking forward for other such great courses from Prof. Robert and Prof. Maggie. Thanks to both professors and their team.</review><course_id>45481</course_id><course_title>Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers (LAFF)</course_title><reviewer_id>33900</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-05-28</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course operates at three levels, I think. First, it helps you get some important principles around computational science and why efficient algorithms are fundamental to computation. Second, it gives you the rationale, foundations, and logic about the principles of matrix manipulation. And third, certainly not least, you get to learn the mathematics and specific practical skills to work with matrices and linear algebra. Having said all of that, I suggest that to get maximum benefit you a) do allocate the 8 hours per week, b) use this time to practice problems and review as you go, and c) delve into the enrichment problems, and they are where the gold is. Having said all of that, it is a course I will personally go back and review when I have more time, and that has additionally inspired further questions. While I have not done a math course of this type for 30 years, and then at a similar level, Robert and Maggie (you do feel you know them at the end!) have excelled in providing a learning standard for this area and level and fulfilling most or all of the likely student needs of someone doing this course. In short, it made sense, is was achievable and it assisted in understanding the application of linear algebra to the world around me.</review><course_id>45481</course_id><course_title>Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers (LAFF)</course_title><reviewer_id>74947</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-05-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Very clear, nice teachers and an easy approach to linear algebra for beginners.

This course stands into the latter. Professors Robert and Maggie not only presents the course masterfully as also interact and respond every single question posted in the forums. Also, you will find most of the exercises and demonstrations very well written and many of those with videos in which the instructors themselves guide you step-by-step. I took this course as a refresher, since I had a previous undergraduate course in Linear Algebra but, not only I was able to review many of the topics I wanted, as also I was presented to some techniques (Flame notation, slicing and dicing...) that really improved my knowledge. There is only one negative aspect of the course in my opinion, and that is their choice to use matlab in the programming assignments instead of python from the last offering. However, even with that, the material is well documented and there are examples in python as well (but I really hope they change back to python in the next editions) Anyway, it was an amazing course and I really recommend it to anyone willing to learn or review the topics of a undergraduate course in Linear Algebra.</review><course_id>45481</course_id><course_title>Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers (LAFF)</course_title><reviewer_id>74560</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-05-09</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I learned Linear Algebra before in school but didn't understand what I was doing. I just recited the calculations (Linear equations, LU, SVD, eigenvalues) and wrote it on the exam papers. It didn't left much or made some changes in my mind after the exam After I graduated from school and found LA is really really really important (Can't express the importance, it's just the language of some subjects). Therefore I took this course, the course well covers the foundations of Linear Algebra which you can find out from typical textbook (except Det) and most importantly, it will teach you how to think and make sense of concepts such as matrix, vector, factorization, eigenvalue, SVD, LU, QR factorization. This course builds my solid foundation and I can go further based on these 12 weeks. The course is easy to follow, self-paced [no deadline except final which is excellent policy for worker] As Robert wrote, A typical undergraduate linear algebra course offering includes a sequence of three classes: 1 Introductory Linear Algebra. [This course] 2 Applied Linear Algebra. 3 Numerical Linear Algebra.

The videos were broken up so it wasn't one giant boring lecture, but rather broken up via theory, practice, examples, and applications. They implemented iPython notebooks. That was an interesting development for a MOOC. I enjoyed them as someone that has computer programming experience, but they were very basic so great for either a rookie or someone who was rusty with reading and writing code. The pace was great, all of the assignments were due initially three weeks after being released, but then a few weeks in the instructors made everything due at the end of the MOOC. The notes were my favorite part. They explained everything first hand before I had to watch the video. And the examples were also in the notes, I rarely had to write anything down myself besides doing the work for the exercises. I wish they had done more for the iPython notebooks in the notes though. Overall, I hope the instructors do more mathematics courses like this. I would love for them to do something similar for Calculus, Multivariable Calculus, Differential Equations.</review><course_id>45481</course_id><course_title>Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers (LAFF)</course_title><reviewer_id>33786</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-05-27</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers is an introductory linear algebra course that teaches linear algebra in the context of computing. If you don't have any familiarity with programming or python, the computing component is going to be hard to follow. You can, however, skip all of the programming parts and just go through the lecture videos and quizzes. Topics include vectors, linear transformations, matrix vector operations, matrix multiplication and inversion, vector spaces, orthogonal projection and bases and eigenvalues and eigenvectors. LAFF requires a major time commitment. Unless you are already familiar with some of the topics, you'll probably spend 5-8 hours a week. It is clear that a tremendous amount of effort went into producing the materials for this course. There are multiple homework exercises after almost every video and most weeks have one or more programming exercises where you implement and visualize linear algebra functions using tools the instructors have created. The instructors were also active on the forums, which was nice to see. If I were to judge this course solely on the amount of content and quality of exercises, it would be 5/5. That said, I didn’t find the instructor engaging on a human level. Math can be boring; instructors that are excited about the topics they teach can go a long way toward mitigating the dryness. The instructor was robotic in his presentation and I often found the lectures hard to follow. When I decided to watch some of Salman Khan’s linear algebra videos on Khan Academy to review for the final, I found his presentation of the same concepts more engaging and easier to understand. I came out of this course feeling like I didn’t learn as much as I could have because the material is not always presented in a way that is easy to follow and my interest waned from time to time. LAFF provides everything you need to build a solid foundation in linear algebra—if you are able to remain attentive despite the dry presentation.</review><course_id>45481</course_id><course_title>Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers (LAFF)</course_title><reviewer_id>31833</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-05-12</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>My lack of linear algebra was beginning to show in my stat classes.

(Actually some of the subjects did not exist when I first took linear algebra in college.) The linear algebra review included in the machine learning course was not adequate. This course, however, more than adequately prepared me to take the machine learning course. In fact, several of the subjects included in this course were described as advance linear algebra subjects by Dr. Ng in the machine learning course. In addition, I now feel quite comfortable with matrix notation and even Matlab vectorization. Previously I had tried to relearn linear algebra with Dr. Strang's book and lectures, but the lack of "homework" problems with good feedback was not adequate. This course covers the material well and has good online homework with excellent backup material.

The theory is very well presented and explained. MatLab is used for practical exercises. Prof. Robert van de Geijn and Maggie Myers were answering themselves every question posted on discussion forums. Probably that was the reason I learned a lot useful information from discussion forums. I also appreciate flexible due dates, there was only one final due date, so I could work on my own pace and successfully complete the course. There is also the textbook available made by course instructors which was extremely helpful. It's probably between best LA textbooks I've seen.

I have an Honours Bachelor of Science degree (Biology/Forensics) but did not really have any linear algebra exposure beyond high school. I have recently developed an interest in statistics and computer programming and thought it would be useful to learn more about linear algebra, so I signed up. I’ll admit that I was intimidated at first, but after only a short time, I realized that this course was made for people like me with very little prior experience in this field; the concepts are carefully presented so that each builds upon the previous work with plenty of opportunities to reinforce the material through homework assignments, two midterm exams and a final exam. It is both challenging and yet, surprisingly intuitive, which I believe is because of how well the material is presented and also, the array of tools that are used to help visualize the concepts (Spark, PictureFLAME, Timmy, MATLAB). The emphasis is on truly learning and understanding the material rather than just achieving a passing grade; the instructors offer unlimited tries for every question and comprehensive answer keys are provided with each question so the student has the ability to try solving the problems as many times as necessary without penalty and is never left wondering how to find the answer. The instructors are active on the discussion board and always willing to answer questions. It was an amazing opportunity to be able to complete this course for free, and I would highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in the STEM-related fields (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), but especially to women, since we are underrepresented in all of those fields - try it out! If you complete every assignment and watch every video (which I recommend doing), the estimated 8 hours/week time commitment was accurate, but it IS absolutely worth your time to LAFF with them. -Kathy D.-</review><course_id>45481</course_id><course_title>Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers (LAFF)</course_title><reviewer_id>53356</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-09-01</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I took this course to build a solid understanding of Linear Algebra and this course delivers on it. The beauty of this class is that it starts with the the most basic definition, "What is a vector?" and "What is a linear transformation?" and builds everything logically, step by step, on it. (In this regard it is like Euclid's Elements). It is this spirit/way of teaching of the course that makes this course so profound in its impact in giving the right understanding of linear algebra. (For example, now I know why matrix multiplication is defined the way it is defined) I did the class by downloading the pdf from http://www.ulaff.net/ and read the book while doing the videos embedded in the pdf To the instructors: I am thankful to the instructors for the phenomenal amount of effort they put in preparing the book, embedding the videos, back link from answers to the text, and preparing all those slides (they are all made in latex, I guess). It is a true labor of love. If you ever want to improve this class add more real world examples of application of linear algebra, particularly for the second part of the course. Disclaimer: I already have a PhD so my experience with the class might or might not be representative of experiences of other. I listened to most of the video at 1.5x speed.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45481</course_id><course_title>Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers (LAFF)</course_title><reviewer_id>34582</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-06-03</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The most fun course I've ever completed.

The material wasn't made in advance, which left the instructors playing "catchup" the whole time. Without much time on their hands, the quality was greatly diminished. For instance, the transcripts and videos were often mismatched so I was seeing transcripts from week 1 on videos from week 12! The format of the lectures was basically the instructor drawing on slideshows (which contained many mistakes and were hard to understand). They contained 2D visuals which were helpful and 3D visuals containing up to 10 vectors which were impossible to decipher. Certificates from this course are completely meaningless because not only do they give you the whole course to complete assignments (exams included), but they even gave you an infinite number of submissions for each problem (exams included), they also let you see the answers at anytime and answer the questions after viewing the answers (exams included)! So anyone can 100% the course without learning a single bit of linear algebra. In the introductory video they say: "In this course you will learn all the standard topics in an undergraduate linear algebra course." At the end of the course, they wrote: "Twelve weeks is not enough time to cover all topics." No surprize when they spent the first 5 weeks covering matrix-matrix multiplication! They LAFF software worked fine for the first 7 weeks or so but after that, I was unable to access any of the software past week one!

Video snippets followed by examples and exercises was more conducive to learning that an hour of reams of alpha-numerics on a whiteboard. I enjoyed the way you partition matrices when implementing algorithms. I just completed the matlab version but I am interested in looking over the iPython notebooks.

However, this course here is something else. It really made me understand what Linear Algebra is; what are the meaning of the things I've always used blindly just to solve problems without really understanding what is going on. The contents are smoothly put, the instructor is very good, he just takes you step by step to master the topic. Although the course I've attended hadn't a serious grading, the homework helped me a lot to understand the materials and to understand not memorize the properties of special matrices for example. I recommend this course for anyone who didn't like Linear Algebra but realized its importance and cannot find the right place to learn it; this is what you're looking for.</review><course_id>45481</course_id><course_title>Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers (LAFF)</course_title><reviewer_id>113418</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-09-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I did linear algebra longtime back in the college and also got exposure of the subject in econometrics and statistics course. But always I felt some gaps - this course provides a good link between usual approach plus programming intuition and why ? Stuff like Matrix Vector Multiplication, LU Decomposition and QR Decomposition , orthogonal projection etc. The course has been developed with a lot effort and research, it starts with simple intuition and builds up the concept very well and every exercise has been chosen for a specific purpose - to introduce a concept in the latter stage. Another unique part of the concept mainly emphasized by Robert is "understanding" matrix and vector by slicing and dicing - which gives an extra edge in visualization, why is happening and why. I would say anybody want to pursue econometrics , statistics and machine learning should start with this. After this course you will be a good position to pursue those subjects at ease.</review><course_id>45481</course_id><course_title>Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers (LAFF)</course_title><reviewer_id>113387</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-09-24</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is a Linear Algebra course that takes you - as promised - from foundations to frontiers. What you get from the course depends on whether your initial knowledge is closer to foundations or frontiers. I can only speculate - as I'm no beginner - that the course is very useful to every beginner who is at least slightly ambitious and self-disciplined. There are a lot of lessons with good explanations and tons of exercices. Some of them require a rigorous, more or less difficult proof - or a reasonable guess, but most are fairly simple and provide ample opportunity for training. Often the questions are designed to make you look for a pattern or a way to reuse a previous result. If you're closer to the frontier, the course may look less interesting, as it is being approached very late and possibly never reached. (Well, that's by design!) At the beginning, depending on your country, you may feel that you know most from school, but even during the earlier lectures a new teacher and perspective may give you exciting insights. During the last lectures I learnt some new stuff, which had not or only very superficially treated in my own numerical mathematics course (destined for physicists and engineers) at university (SVD, SVD &amp; OLS estimators). Even if "foundations to frontiers" is slightly exagerated: it starts from zero and goes beyond the level of many university-level courses. Thanks to Maggie Myers and Robert van de Geijn for offering this course!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45481</course_id><course_title>Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers (LAFF)</course_title><reviewer_id>113353</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-09-23</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The content was excellent, particularly for anyone with a computer science tilt. I particularly enjoyed two aspects of the course. The first was the focus on core principles that I had failed to learn previously taking linear algebra- two examples being that matrix-vector multiplication is *defined* as to represent a linear function / transformation and that matrix-matrix multiplication is *defined* as to represent linear function composition. The second aspect was the focus on proof writing- specifically in proving the correctness of algorithms.

Split into 12 weeks, the first 8 weeks introduce you gently, and the final 4 weeks pick the pace up with juicy topics such as basis transforms and eigenvectors. Each week has an enrichment section to put the new knowledge in context and offer some more advanced applications. The lectures are very well put together, they are usually short and interspersed with homework questions to check you understood the video. This instant correction is really valuable. The exams have a practice exam first with video proofs which really help fill in gaps in knowledge. Having taken about 10 MOOCs, I was really impressed with how much time Robert and Maggie spent answering questions and helping out on the forums.</review><course_id>45481</course_id><course_title>Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers (LAFF)</course_title><reviewer_id>113097</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-09-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I took this course in the summer 2015 offering and I am very glad that I did. Even though I found the material challenging as I am in the declining years of my life, it was still worth the effort and it was very pleasing to be able to complete it. The course is nicely structured and presented in a student friendly style with (short) videos and accompanying script. There is also a pdf of the material available as well which contains some material additional to the video material. It is advisable to watch/read both. The videos are short enough for the student to absorb without being overwhelmed with new information. The material is organised into 12 sections. The first eight of these involved getting used to the FLAME notation and routines developed at UT Austin and putting them into practice in doing vector-vector operations, matrix-vector operations and matrix-matrix operations using Matlab. I found that having to program the operations deepened my understanding of them. The remaining four sections were a step up in complexity, covering vector spaces, linear independence, bases, orthogonality, orthonormal bases, orthogonal projection, eigenvalues, eigenvectors and diagonalisation. In each section there were online exercises to be done. Apart from programming exercises there were also calculation and multiple choice exercises. These latter were cleverly designed to elicit the properties of vectors, matrices and their operations. In addition there were two midterm and one final exam. Preparing for these helped to consolidate the material. I found that I had to ask myself such questions as: How do you go about LU factorisation? How do you find a basis for the column space of a matrix? row space? null space? How do you go about QR factorisation? How do you handle an underdetermined system? an overdetermined system? How do you project onto a column space? How do you find eigenvalues? eigenvectors? How do you diagonalise a matrix? There was also a discussion forum where one could ask questions, make comments etc. The presenters Robert and Maggie were very prompt in replying. Their open-minded approach enhanced the feel good factor one got from this course.</review><course_id>45481</course_id><course_title>Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers (LAFF)</course_title><reviewer_id>112906</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-09-13</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Great course! It starts very simple but step by step it develops to college level or under graduate math. By using Matlab (free time limited student license for use during the course) you get a good insight in computations with matrices. But…programming, even with an easy and intuitive programming language, can be time consuming. It's not necessary but I could not resist to do all the assignments. The 8 hours a week became about16 hours. Many extra material is offered for those who like practical applications and have an interest in math papers. For those with an interest in Quantum Physics: this course introduces matrix calculations, vector spaces, shifting to another orthogonal basis, and in the last week explores matrices with eigenvalues and eigenvectors. It's a nice course to start with linear algebra, or refresh your memory and extent your knowledge.</review><course_id>45481</course_id><course_title>Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers (LAFF)</course_title><reviewer_id>112869</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-09-11</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The amount of work these professors and their teams put into creating this course is amazing. I have never taken and hardly even seen matrices in my past. It was a challenging and gratifying course. This course is one that really sets a high bar not only for MOOC courses, but offline courses as well. Massive amounts of slides where the professor walks you through the logical progression of the content. The two profs who put the course together really know how to get the relevant points across. If I were to make one suggestion, it would be to have a lengthier video earlier on in the course explaining the block matrix notation by itself, since so much of the course (and algorithms) depend on the student being able to connect the notation with what it would mean on matrices of different sizes. Well done to the Profs, everyone who put the course together, and University of Texas. This will serve as a foundational piece of my future studies.</review><course_id>45481</course_id><course_title>Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers (LAFF)</course_title><reviewer_id>112867</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-09-11</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Great Course densely packed with knowledge and well taught.

I had previously taken an Intro to Linear Algebra course that was strictly for math majors with no programming involved. It had been several years and I had only used linear algebra once since then. This course was perfect for me, because I also have a CompSci minor, so the focus on the algorithms for programming was very interesting to me. Note that the programming part is optional, you can do the course without doing the programming exercises (there is an option to skip those, and I had to skip them nearer the end due to time constraints). Also, this course simply helped me tie together the concepts much better than my first introduction to linear algebra, and covered topics that I don't even remember covering in my first class. I highly recommend to anyone interested in learning about linear algebra. Another note: although I had prior experience, I believe that the way the subject is presented would be quite good for a first time exposure to the subject. Excellent video lectures, materials, and solutions!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45481</course_id><course_title>Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers (LAFF)</course_title><reviewer_id>112737</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-09-08</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>I'm afraid I couldn't get past the first week of the course.

I have taken some linear algebra before, but it wasn't very practical. For example, about a year ago, I tried to write a program to solve a very large matrix with cramers rule. Needless to say, it didn't work out very well. If I had taken this course first, I could have easily made a program to solve that matrix in an efficient manner. Overall, I feel this course taught the theory extremely well, while grounding that theory in practical programming. The last few chapters are a little rushed, but I suppose that's to be expected with an already-long course. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting a very solid understanding of basic linear algebra, and exposure to many of the more advanced topics.

Absolutely The Best Learning Experience I Have Ever Had. The best in all respects; The best professors; clear, concise, knowledgeable, interesting, interested, concerned, leading edge contributors, expert presenters, easy to understand, provide a deeper view than in an ordinary course in this subject area. Prof v. d. Geijn’s participation level in the discussions board is amazing. A great subject: of current topical interest to me, inherently interesting in and of itself, lends itself well to a MOOC format and schedule flexibility. The algorithmic emphasis is very valuable to me both here and beyond the course area – a new way to see the light in areas where it may have been neglected in our rush for answers. A great course philosophy; to meet the needs of different students with differing objectives, needs, backgrounds. A complete integrated learning system; outstanding lectures as well as complete background and supporting materials for mainstream/core and enrichment topics. Interesting homework/exercises; which support the learning and are much more than rote application of formulas. Some are quite challenging (at least to me). The process of interleaving the lectures and the homework is very powerful. The sequence of questions also brings insights. Access to outstanding tools; MATLAB, FLAME, Spark, Timmy. Access to MATLAB alone is worth the price of the course. I wish I could justify a personal copy.</review><course_id>45481</course_id><course_title>Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers (LAFF)</course_title><reviewer_id>111701</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-08-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course is very good at tackling simple matrix and vector operations. The many ways of slicing and dicing matrices and vectors aided my understanding of the material, and this perspective of slicing and dicing improved my grasp on the properties of matrices. Furthermore, coding on MATLAB also provided an excellent test of my understanding. The course offers many excellent exercises to show the properties of special matrices like upper, lower, diagonal, symmetric, and the identity matrix, and are supplemented by simple proofs in many notations like the FLAME notation. In the second part of the course, applications of matrix operations using slicing and dicing were given such as the QR factorization. Even though LAFF is just an introductory course, I learned a lot even though I haven taken an introductory undergraduate course in linear algebra in the past. The enrichment activities and readings also made me appreciate linear algebra techniques. For those who are totally new to linear algebra, it helps to go over the notes, exercises, and answers.</review><course_id>45481</course_id><course_title>Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers (LAFF)</course_title><reviewer_id>111606</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-08-14</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course is a very solid foundation for future work with linear systems.

It is obvious that a lot of thought and hard work went into creating this course, and I am very grateful to the instructors for all their hard work.

This professor really wants you to understand fundamental concepts rather than just memorizing techniques that could be misapplied if one doesn't understand the fundamentals. The professor goes out of his way to create explanations for the quizzes/homework ... including recording short videos to explain it, posting downloadable explanations, etc. This iteration of the course also includes a license of Matlab for the duration of the course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45481</course_id><course_title>Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers (LAFF)</course_title><reviewer_id>34033</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-06-01</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Thanks Robert and Maggie.

It builds concepts one atop another in a very logical, systematic way. The programming segments might be difficult for someone with no programming experience, but someone like me who has not worked with Python before but has worked with other programming languages should be able to manage fairly easily. The highlight of this course was the enrichment material covering computational complexity and how linear algebra software libraries can decrease the number of memory operations. I would very much like to take a more advanced EdX course on linear algebra or vector calculus taught by the same professors. For instance, this course rarely used complex-valued vectors or matrices and completely omitted calculus topics, like Jacobian matrices, both of which I would like to study further.</review><course_id>45481</course_id><course_title>Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers (LAFF)</course_title><reviewer_id>33566</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-05-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Congratulations to Robert, Maggie and the LAFF team for putting on a superb course.

I hated it. It was too easy to make tedious simple arithmetic mistakes and get the final answer wrong. So I took this course the way I wanted to with the following personal objectives: 1\. Understand how to use modern tools such as Octave, R, NumPy, Lapack, understand the linear algebra semantics and apply them appropriately in real world engineering and big data settings. 2\. Get some familiarity with how to do the hand calculations (maybe do it a few times), but I don't want to dwell on this. (I discovered LU decomposition in Octave does not necessarily give the same answers as the course, so I automated the steps of the hand calculations the course way, in python, to get the same answer using the same steps. Did the same for row echelon form to avoid the tedium of writing on paper.) 3\. Get some familiarity of the semantics from the proofs and derivations, but again a secondary concern. 4\. Have some awareness of computational cost of operations. (This is where the course is novel for me, and I appreciate it, esp. since I work in the software field.) Also, I appreciate a robust introduction into slicing and dicing, since this is a practical consideration when things may not all fit into memory, or the need to split up the job into for parallel computation. Because of the availability of modern tools (Python, Octave), I felt the course could've spent more time with higher level abstractions, perhaps in the second half of the course, such as eigen decomposition, SVD, with a focus on meaning and appropriate application rather than the mechanics of hand calculations. Having now done both Cousera and EdX formats, I felt EdX was ideal for this course. EdX seems to allow for very small lectures, on a single topic, followed immediately with small exercise. And there are lots of these. It is much more fine grained in feedback than Coursera, and in some ways ideal for this course.</review><course_id>45481</course_id><course_title>Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers (LAFF)</course_title><reviewer_id>32966</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-05-14</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>If you want a course that is friendly but at the same time challenging, well this is the course.

The information is presented in a clear way through diagrams and supporting text which is available for downloading for future reference. However, I found the first quiz a little confusing - why are there questions about the gallblader and which organ is the first to receive nutrients when, as far as I can see, these are not even mentioned in the content? Or have I simply missed an important component of the course? It seems like students are quizzed on matters that haven't been taught as yet.

The content was thorough and well presented. I liked that there were visuals presented via the animated videos. I liked the professor's sense of humor and it was clear he was really knowledgeable about nutrition and the issues surrounding nutrition. I especially liked the interviews with other nutrition experts who have been in the field for a long time. The peer assessment final exam was very well done and an important part of learning. The area where I would recommend making changes is in the quizzes and section exams. Many questions were awkward or ambiguous and it was hard to determine the correct answer. I suspect that these questions may have been created and written by someone whose first language was not English. Perhaps review and edit and make the questions and responses easy to read and understand. I'm a native English speaker and I struggled making sense of many of the questions.

I learned a lot, and the material was presented in an engaging way. I was surprised at how much one-on-one contact there was between the professor, the staff, and the 34,000 students - I don't know how they had the time to answer all our questions, but they did (at least, they answered all of mine, and I saw plenty of others being answered too). I would take a follow-up course from this team on this topic again.</review><course_id>20346</course_id><course_title>Nutrition and Health Part 1: Macronutrients and Overnutrition</course_title><reviewer_id>73767</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-03-23</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>This course was good. It was slightly more in depth than other MOOCs that I have taken, which is a good thing for me because I am currently studying nutrition at university and used this course as revision.

I just finished the course and I thank you for giving me the opportunity to learn new topics in the field of nutrition . In recent years I attribute a lot of importance to food, especially the quality of the food and its content . Therefore, this course has been very educational for me, because the subjects were treated in a scientific manner and Professor Sander Kersten helped me to debunk many preconceptions .

The text that runs alongside the videos needs proof-reading, e.g. the spoken word 'fraught' comes out as 'fraud' in the text, and some of the grammar is a bit odd. An interesting revision for me as I studied science to degree level about 40 years ago, and some useful updating.

The real value of EDx MOOC's is that in an online world full of contradictory and bad information EDx will bring you information from the worlds top universities that you can rely on or see in the right perspective.

And it seems like some rated it based on their expectation alone. I am taking the course and I can say it's neatly designed.

However, to understand better about health and nutrition, a complex problem as the course said, I would recommend other more comprehensive courses which are also available on edX.</review><course_id>20346</course_id><course_title>Nutrition and Health Part 1: Macronutrients and Overnutrition</course_title><reviewer_id>61253</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-12-16</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review/><course_id>20346</course_id><course_title>Nutrition and Health Part 1: Macronutrients and Overnutrition</course_title><reviewer_id>60914</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-11-24</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>As a wellness and diet coach, I've written my own health &amp; nutrition testimonial upon surviving living without ovaries but still look great, healthy, and alert.

The lecture videos are holistic in their way of introducing as well as elucidating the concepts. Some students may face little problem understanding the accent, but, that has been taken care of by providing handouts and the subtitles in various languages. The exercises and problems are really the most intriguing part of the course. The instructors have presented a variety of type of questions and at the same time used different platforms such as Blockly, CodeBoard, Greenfoot application etc. which never allow to you loose your attention from the course. The tests at the end of each week were very challenging and leave no margin to check your grasp on the concepts. The instructors are very experienced and explain the topics by providing simple analogies. They motivate to explore the topics on our own. The discussion platform provided in this course was one of the features I liked the most. Everyone was free to ask questions and present their answers. It created an environment where students shared their knowledge with each other and consequently gained more than the course material. This course helped me to learn the Java fundamental in a very lucid manner. I am obliged to the instructors of this course, other students and edX team. I would recommend this course to those who don't have any prior experience with programming in Java.</review><course_id>36330</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Programming with Java Part 1: Starting to Code with Java</course_title><reviewer_id>119076</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-03-04</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Overall, I really like this course. The Instructor is sometimes hard to understand, due to his accent( I use the captions if I can't understand.), but you can tell he has had a lot of experience and really knows what he is talking about. everything he presents usually makes sense, and I can remember what he has taught. The videos are pretty easy to understand, but the worksheets sometimes are difficult to understand what they want you to do.

Often the concepts were not related to clear reasons for the subject matter as the course instruction went too quickly. I think that it is ridiculous for beginning students to sit and analyze code segments instead of just presenting the knowledge factors, showing many instructional examples and then giving exams that relate to the principles in a direct manner and not intersperse them with a multitude confusing statements and multiple correct/incorrect answers. Let the students have programming assignments that implement the instructional material. The course approach disenfranchises learning. Finally, Spanish accents are really bad and some of the instructors accents were a distraction from learning the material as the verbal delivery was unintelligible and caused this student to have to read the lecture text at the same time. Some youtube videos are better and more enlightening and elucidating. Overall, the course was OK for me as I am very a experienced programmer and this introduction to Java was interesting, but the information value declined as the course progressed both as an interesting experience and informative one.</review><course_id>36330</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Programming with Java Part 1: Starting to Code with Java</course_title><reviewer_id>118797</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-02-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Probably the best Java intro course with really clear explanations and interactive examples!

You can see it on the slides and hear it from the videos. Don't be deceived by the apparently introductory content and the bite-size subsections/ videos. Dive into the course a bit first. Do the ungraded exercises-- be a good student. Do .Not. miss the labs. I suggest taking notes, i.e. typing codes and your own comments in your own local environment such as Eclipse during videos, labs and homework. Then you'll see. I love courses that I must pause a number of times just to realize the well-designed coherence between the videos, or just to let the words sink in because the words matter... not like some radio shows... I finished the course months ago and realized I didn't give it proper respect. I'm very happy to have my second chance and have this course as my first proper introduction to Java :).</review><course_id>36330</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Programming with Java Part 1: Starting to Code with Java</course_title><reviewer_id>118606</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-02-18</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>Excellent course for both java beginner and java intermediate level.

It covers too much ground and at too fast a pace. It does not give the student enough time to become thoroughly familiar with a new concept before moving on to the next concept. It is, however, an excellent refresher course aimed at students who already have experience in this area but who have been "out of the game" for a while and who want to brush up on their skills. The material is well presented and the production values are of a high quality. There are one or two occasions when the presenters' lack of fluency in the English language lets them down, but these are insignificant errors for the most part (eg mispronunciations). I look forward to repeating this course at some time in the future, when I have mastered the basics of Java programming and have acquired some experience of writing original programs of my own.</review><course_id>36330</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Programming with Java Part 1: Starting to Code with Java</course_title><reviewer_id>111635</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-08-15</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>While starting slowly, this course would be tough for anyone without a programming background.

There were many times where the lectures did not go over material that was on the exams / tests. In the beginning of the course I felt they were going over material that someone taking this course should already know and later in the course they were skipping or glossing over subjects that needed more attention and then asking detailed questions about it on the exams. There were a lot of times where I had to go to another website to learn the material before being able to complete a problem / question on the exam. I found it so odd that at one point I looked up some questions that were not covered at all in the lecture and found that they bought their questions from another website, so that explained it. Communication was another issue. The primary instructor is somewhat fluent in English and not too hard to understand but some of the other instructors had rudimentary English and were very difficult to understand, which can make the experience harder than it needs to be. I finished with a 96/100 but I think that was only because of my experience with non-object oriented programming languages. Someone who has no prior programming experience will definitely have a very tough time with this course. I would definitely not recommend it to anyone.</review><course_id>36330</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Programming with Java Part 1: Starting to Code with Java</course_title><reviewer_id>111601</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-08-14</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Excellent course, but I didn't have enough time to complete the course.

You cannot simply type code in the editor and have it run. I spent many hours trying to hand simulate code but I have never SEEN how a for loop runs through tracking a program and observing how the variables change. The lectures need to adopt the creative writing approach -- Show! Not tell!

I spoke to several students about this in discussion boards. Often times, the assignments were well beyond what was covered and this was very frustrating. I paid for verified track and about 3/4 of the way through had to throw in the towel because the lectures didn't cover what was demanded of the assignments. It was a terrible experience. To be fair, I did learn some understanding of Java---just not to the extent where I could program worth a darn. If you have no prior knowledge, skip this course and find a better one.</review><course_id>36330</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Programming with Java Part 1: Starting to Code with Java</course_title><reviewer_id>111585</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-08-14</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>More difficult then I thought an Introduction would be.

It is a good introductory course. It used interesting ways of providing exercises in standard programming techniques. All programming tools worked properly and without a lot of effort on my part to install and use them on my Windows desktop PC. Some exercises were less than clearly defined. I found some relatively minor errors in class instructions and other materials. The course have used a better way than the "forum" for students to communicate directly with course providers. Similarly, a broadcast mechanism for course providers to provide clear concise communication to all students as the course progressed would have been useful. I liked the peer feedback mechanism for grading, but the tool did not give me a way to give precise and detailed feedback to those I reviewed. Many of the work outputs that I reviewed were unacceptable, in my opinion, and really required extensive feedback which the peer-review tool did not allow. I also felt the feedback from most who reviewed my work was superficial. I'm not sure how you get around that with first time programmers. All in all, I enjoyed the course very much and look forward to taking the next installment. I hope that next class includes programming GUI interfaces.</review><course_id>36330</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Programming with Java Part 1: Starting to Code with Java</course_title><reviewer_id>111579</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-08-14</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>I didn't have time to finish the course, but, as I worked through the content with a first-time Java programmer, I felt that there was a fairly significant disconnect between what was taught in the videos and the exercises and tests students were expected to complete. Despite being an intelligent person and a logical thinker, she was often lost and confused. When I reviewed the videos for the sections and exercises she was stuck on, I could really see why she was struggling. Finally, I suggested she stop taking the class, and I just gave here a good Java book to work through. Her understanding of Java and her ability to write working code for the book's exercises. immediately improved.

Avery good introduction to Java. I had programmed in Pascal and C over 20 years ago so some aspects were easy for me but many features of the Java language were new to me. I did, like some others, get caught out by the submission date for the final programming assignment, so always open each module as soon as it is available and check the required submission dates, not the date that appears in the menu. The course moved at a fairly fast rate which is good. The instructors were good and I would recommend this course as an excellent introduction for anyone wanting to get feel for Java.

I took this course with the intention of learning enough to be able to build and program my own quad. I did not learn that. I did learn a lot of things, and for that I am very grateful. I consider this course to be more of an introduction rather than a higher level course. I am starting this post in the hopes that others will add to it and then the instructors can get some useful feedback if/when they teach this course in the future. So let's get started. Pros: Great introductory course to the requirements of autonomous flight in quadrotors This course is easy to follow and even novice programmers have a good opportunity to successfully finish this course. The homework does a decent job of reviewing a person's mathematics abilities and somewhat testing their programming skills. The flow of the course is well thought out and given the length of the course, the instructors did an excellent job of organizing the material. Cons: A lot of the conceptual aspects were not very well explained during the lecture. I found this to be the case while doing the homework. Some of the homework was more of a puzzle rather than a test of understanding. For example, homework week 6 when trying to determine the correct state vector. In this exercise we were given a set of inputs in matrix form and needed to pop out a matrix. If a person did not understand the concept, but does understand the rules of matrix multiplication, the exercise was no more than a rearranging of the order of items until a matrix of the right dimensions results. It was not just in this homework, but a few places. The programming. While I am not an expert programmer, I am not a novice either. I completed the course with high marks but I did often times struggle with the programming. It wasn't so much that I didn't understand the programming, but I would have (not speaking for others) benefited by more understanding of the back end. Example: the race. At no point prior to this assignment were we given an idea of how the kalman filter was fed into the PID controller except for a slide that said the prediction is fed into the PID controller. Maybe the point was to figure that out, but the process would have been easier (and again for me, would have given a better understanding of how the program functions work together) and given a better idea of the conceptual portion of how the mathematics is implemented into the programming. I would have appreciated a little more depth in the course. Perhaps this wasn't in the course due to length or the instructors did not want to give a full type of course through this medium, but a bit more depth and exercises (especially to extend understanding of the kalman filter) would have been appreciated. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this course. I am going to continue with Autonomous Mobile Robots (ETHx - AMRx - if anyone is interested) with the hopes of extending my understanding of the subject matter. Finally, I want to say thank you to edX for creating this platform and to people at TUM Dept. of Informatics/Computer Vision for putting this course together. It was an enjoyable experience and I appreciate your time and effort.</review><course_id>35736</course_id><course_title>Autonomous Navigation for Flying Robots</course_title><reviewer_id>110321</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-07-05</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Super!</review><course_id>35736</course_id><course_title>Autonomous Navigation for Flying Robots</course_title><reviewer_id>110302</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-07-04</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I really enjoyed this course, particularly using the drone simulator.

You get to really understand the basics and motivation for state estimation, control and application of linear algebra in describing the position of the robot in the world. Supplement this with actually implementing what we have learnt in the python based simulator really does help to build your understanding. The forums were active and queries did get resolved swiftly. One downside of this being, Instructors hardly participate in the forums. You need to understand the Probability theory and especially gaussian distribution to understand the extension of this in predicting random errors from the sensors. To make the most out of this course, one has to take the support of the literature mentioned in tandem with the video lectures(simply relying on video lectures won't work).

It was definitely challenging, but very rewarding at the same time :) Some notes: Not everything you need to know is taught in the course, but where external information is required the course will often provide links (and for everything else there's google).

The assignments don't match the difficulty level of the lectures though - you only need to write a few lines of code in each problem. The small amount of work in each assignment leaves you with a good general idea of how things work, but simply completing the requirements in each assignment won't leave you comfortable programming a quad on your own. The course does give you the tools(quad simulator) to learn the intricacies, but you'll have to step beyond the assigned homework to get a very solid understanding.

The quadrotor simulator was very well done, and was enjoyable to program. It is a graduate level course, so the assumption is that you either have the prerequisite knowledge or can pick it up yourself. That said, the linear algebra used in the course is basic. The course only uses a fraction of what is mentioned in the "linear algebra review" lecture. If you can take the transpose of a matrix, you will be OK. :-) You will need to know Python and NumPy, since the homework assignments involve programming the simulated quadrotor in a subset of both. You don't need advanced knowledge of either, but a basic familiarity with object oriented programming in Python will allow you to concentrate on implementing the algorithms without being frustrated.</review><course_id>35736</course_id><course_title>Autonomous Navigation for Flying Robots</course_title><reviewer_id>110253</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-07-02</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>I really enjoyed taking this course. More experience with Python would have been helpful (I didn't have any) but I managed to learn the basics as I went. You don't have to write that many lines of code, but it was frustrating at times to get tripped up on syntax. I also had to brush up on linear algebra (i.e. vectors and matrices), because its been 30 years since I've used any of that ( I earned my engineering degree in 1983). All in all, I felt challenged, but was able to complete the course work by supplementing the course content with information easily found on the internet. The discussion forums were very useful too in getting questions answered. The course provides a very good overview of the control theory used in quadrotors.

If you are familiar with basic computer vision, 3D geometry and optimal control, you are not going to learn much more from the lectures, although the instructors mentioned that the survey results encourage them to make the lectures more advanced in the future sessions. The lectures contain several demos of working autonomous quadrocopters, though. After completing the course I don’t feel ready to take a copter and make it fly, as I initially expected. The instructors provided a really wonderful simulation environment, but the programming assignments themselves did not encourage to solve difficult practical problems, which is especially daunting given that great environment. To sum up, I think the course is too basic now, but has a great potential.</review><course_id>35736</course_id><course_title>Autonomous Navigation for Flying Robots</course_title><reviewer_id>41923</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-07-14</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>This is an interesting course and seems to cover the basics well in the time available. Four hours seems a generous estimate. I usually took less, though there were times when I would have spent the full four hours. The course has some moderate maths requirements and some programming is involved. It would be advisable to know linear algebra (nothing more difficult than inversion) and Python. Having said that, I didn't know any python before I started, and was able to get through just fine, though it did slow me down at some points. The pracs usually involve being provided with some skeleton code and having to fill in the missing functions. For the most part this is easy, but because a lot of the functionality happens "behind the scenes" and the debugging options are limited, I did find some of the problems were more difficult than they needed to be simply because it was hard to work out exactly what was required. Why would you do this course? It provided some introductory material culminating in producing a Kalman filter to determine the position of an object in a bayesian way. Simple image transforms, integrating sensor readings and employing uncertainty were all used. If this is of interest, even if you aren't interested in quad copters, then this could be for you.

Currently working for an ISP, where reasoning is about the onlything I use from my degree. I was looking for something to do to brush up as I don't currently need to utilize my education background in my day job. This course was a decent start! The subject matter was very interesting and the lecture format (especially with the dictation) was really great. The homework however more specifically the simulator and programming assignments conceptually was also well thought out. However I think in practice was a little too easy to asses ones understanding of the material. As other students have pointed out. Most of the assignments focused on implementing one small function out of the whole weeks concept, while the vast majority was provided. This effectively kept the assignments short however didn't especially force an understanding of the overall process for that weeks material. The final weeks assignment would have been an excellent culmination to the course if not for the fact that from all the previous weeks one merely made a few edits to the previously provided code (and their previous hw) to tie everything together. I think had the majority of the programming assignments been like the final hw, it would have provided a better assessment. Regardless to the driven individual interested in learning about the concepts behind autonomous navigation and some of the techniques implemented. There is more than enough material and free resources mentioned in the course to do just that. I really enjoyed this course, I am a little bummed I didn't sign up for the verified track. I hope that this course is offered again and the instructors take into account some of the feedback on the assignments.</review><course_id>35736</course_id><course_title>Autonomous Navigation for Flying Robots</course_title><reviewer_id>37373</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-08-26</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Fun experience with a focus on applications.

You can ace the course without it, but you might not understand what you are doing. The course covers topics like Kalman filters and basic control law theory at a high level. it does not cover Visual Odometery, Visual SLAM, path planning, ROS... it cannot cover these topics in 8 hours of lecture and 24 hours of homework. the lectures were okay. not great, not bad. It relies on the AR Drone to advertise the course, but there is no integration of the AR drone in the labs. The simulator is cool and fun to play with, but they very carefully craft each lab to focus you on 1 or 2 functions, hiding the rest. each lab requires maybe 6-10 lines of code. overall, i was disappointed in the course.</review><course_id>35736</course_id><course_title>Autonomous Navigation for Flying Robots</course_title><reviewer_id>37041</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-06-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Great course.

As long as you have that, it does not take many hours per week; the official estimate of 4 hours/week is about right for my average. You also need a reasonable level of knowledge about Python. Knowledge of numpy also helps. Fortunately, as far as I'm concerned, they do not use Matlab in this course. The homework is quite easy and just completing the homework is not usually enough to consolidate your learning, but this is the type of field that I think you only will strongly get to grips with if you try to do your own quadrotor flying, and some good tips are given for how to obtain a quadrotor and use it.

I just registered at College Writing 2.2x and I'm raring to get into the thick of everything. I consider my initiative in opting for this MOOC purely as a journey to enrich myself with the knowledge in English to be gained as well as the worldwide network of friends to be made. It's not hot air; rather the truth, when I say I'm shivering in delight like how I joined primary school for the first time many many centuries ago. Haha! Lol Seriously, thanks to the the academic staff and members of various supports who have made this possible. And, made me feel like a brand new school kid, all over again.

No pinned thread where you can respond to the questions or instructions so students just keep on adding post. You rarely, if ever, feel the presence of TF's or instructor in the discussion, which is more important for a writing course, than say, a math subject, because you need feedback. I understand it's not feasible to always be "talking" with every student, but other courses made it possible for you to at least "feel" the course team's presence. You would see them responding to questions or concerns and commenting on students' posts. If there's any relevant discussion going on between students, it will even be addressed on the course info the following week. And they can do that because there are pinned threads making it easy to monitor how active a discussion thread is getting. I can't help but agree to another reviewer who feels like the course is just a compilation of resources. There are explanatory videos, but, as with other subjects from the same provider, you feel left to your own device. I'm taking the course as a refresher, I imagine it being more difficult for those who don't have prior experience in college writing. There's another edX writing course you might want to try before taking this one.</review><course_id>36381</course_id><course_title>How to Write an Essay</course_title><reviewer_id>113385</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-09-24</review_date><review_value>3</review_value><review>This is mainly an annotated collection of references to books and other websites -- not a course in itself. Definitions of central concepts are seldom provided, rather a few examples are given and "if you want to know more, please visit..." Deeper explanations and theoretical discussions are nonexistent. The first two weeks of the course are contained in less than 15 minutes of videos and a couple of pages of text; this quite telling of these issues. The complete course material seems to be in the teacher's book, which she sells. That book is heavily referenced, and one wonders whether the main objective of the course is to act as an advert.</review><course_id>36381</course_id><course_title>How to Write an Essay</course_title><reviewer_id>112932</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-09-13</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I have never learn any online writting course.

The course is just wrapping up today, so don't put too much stock into reviews made more than a few weeks before now. I'll start by saying I don't normally take courses that aren't focused on technical topics like computing, math or science because I don't find many of them to be of practical use. When I saw a course entitled "Becoming a resilient person" I was quite skeptical because it sounded like the sort of fluff course you'd take to pad your schedule in college to raise your GPA. I decided to sign up for it anyway because the time commitment was minimal and I wanted to check out the first week's material to confirm my suspicions. Eight weeks later, I must say I'm glad I took this course. It discusses many important life topics that affect happiness and wellbeing such as values, goals, mindfulness, gratitude, managing emotions, making therapeutic lifestyle choices and making meaningful social connections and takes time to give actionable advice for making positive changes in your life. On the technical side, the lecture videos are well organized, the instructor is always on screen and he delivers information clearly. The materiel is very accessible, so almost anyone could take this course. There are short, easy quizzes each week and homework that usually involves using what you've learned in your life or explaining concepts discussed in lecture to willing ear like a close friend or family member. Given the low time commitment required, this MOOC provides great value.  The forums were littered with posts about how the course helped people make positive changes in their lives. There's no guarantee you'll see any positive changes, but for an investment of 8-15 hours, you have a lot to gain and not much to lose.</review><course_id>35742</course_id><course_title>Becoming a Resilient Person - The Science of Stress Management</course_title><reviewer_id>30838</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-05-05</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>today the course starts can anybody help guiding how to view the course and get going .

It doesn't present anything you wouldn't find elsewhere in a faster or better way.

I personnally couldn't wait for the next week. My only regret is the fact to not receive a certificate of achievement which is always gratifying. I hope Clay will organize other courses soon.

This course so far has great content, interesting but not oversimplified or too technical. I love the videos, the quizzes and the fact it's over 9 weeks, which gives me time to focus on implementing what I learn to strengthen my resilience.

I have been looking forward to beginning this course for a week or so and set aside other activities just to be fully present today. Not being able to drink in the concepts and get started has actually forced me to connect with myself and just...be with myself for a few hours with nothing on my list and nothing to rush to do. So far, so good. If this is the intent of the prof then I like this very much. If it is just a glitch then I am already learning how to relax when something doesn't go as planned just be reframing the way that I perceive it. Hope you decide to give this a try.

I did not care for the speaker as I could see him looking down reading from a script as a poorly presented prezi was active behind him during the entire 8 weeks.

Cook for the enthusiasm that he conveyed through the course on Resiliency. His common sense in presenting the options we all have to face a every day stresses in an mindful and educated way. It has opened for me a whole new perspective on life and it´s ups and down´s at age 70. Even though this was my first experience in an actual e-course, I have read many books on self improvement and self help such as Eckhart Tol, Mel Levine, Hart and others. To compare this on hand course with the information from books is a hands down winner from my perspective. I understood all concepts, I enjoyed every minute, I took notes to share with my children and grandchildren, even with friends. It has even given me a chance to really look in to my soul to re-evaluate my true values.</review><course_id>35742</course_id><course_title>Becoming a Resilient Person - The Science of Stress Management</course_title><reviewer_id>42718</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-07-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I thought this was a terrific course taught by an instructor with passion for passing along information.

Since it's my first online course, I have so much to learn on how to be able to communicate better into coming across my point of reference.

The course is beautifully designed starting with an Introduction to Quantum Mechanics. In a couple of weeks, we are already applying gates and dealing with circuits as we start dealing with Quantum Computation, yet it does so in a very gradual and gentle manner. Before you know, you are already face to face with Quantum Algorithms, but still it never feels like you are being rushed into a topic. The last few weeks deal with Schrödinger's equation, Quantum Systems and how to practically implement these qubits. I somehow cannot wrap my head around the fact that I learnt so much in like 10 weeks! I can now perform magical things like: Perform tensor products! (Tensor sounded really scary before I took this course) Use the Dirac Bra-Ket Notations for qubits! (Those little angles don't look complex now) Showing you how Quantum Teleportation works! How weird and beautiful Quantum Entanglement is! How powerful quantum systems can be in comparison to classical systems! How a 2-D qubit gets mapped to real-life 3-D by a Bloch Sphere! How to implement these qubits through Spin! ...and countless more things If you are even slightly curious about this topic, you should definitely give this a try. I really hope there's another advanced course to follow this one up. Thank you so much CS191x team!</review><course_id>36388</course_id><course_title>Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computation</course_title><reviewer_id>1385</reviewer_id><review_date>2013-04-23</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>I took this subject as my seminar topic n studied it on my own to deliver a presentation n manipulate teachers.

I come from a CS background, and found that the course's approach, focusing more on computation than physics in the early weeks, was very helpful in easing me into the later material.

By the time you get to Schrodingers equation, you have an "Aha" moment - so that's what they were talking about.

Beautiful, awesome, succinct, clarity, intuitive would be few of the adjuncts I would like to use for the course structure, presentation. There is need for more quiz questions within the lectures which would first test the students understanding and with answers add more depth. I was fortunate to have good maths teachers and have not forgotten matrix calculations (last i studied them in 1977 at St.Joseph's college, Trichy.) and complex number calculations. As some fellow students have commented in the discussion forum, refresher lecture are material on matrix , eigen vectors , complex number calculations would be helpful.

I was wondering about how to get the first knowledge...the "a b c" of quantum computing. Then one of my friends suggested me this course and I was amazed to find out that most of the preliminary topics of this field were going to be covered in this course. Then after listening to the lectures of the first week I really fell in love with the world of quantum computation. And it must be said that Prof Vazirani. the instructor of this course is a great mentor. He himself is a living legend of this field and he really structured the course contents in a very effective manner. This course would give you a first sip this emerging new topic and also provide you useful insights of future researches. I f you want to engage yourself in researches which would change the future of human kind altogether, i would suggest you take this course to help you lay the first layer of bricks in building your dreams.</review><course_id>36388</course_id><course_title>Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computation</course_title><reviewer_id>1373</reviewer_id><review_date>2013-04-22</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>A truly excellent and enjoyable course with impressive coverage. The lectures and the (sometimes tricky) exercises offer many practical insights, not just into Quantum Computation, but also into the more controversial aspects of Quantum Mechanics in general, such as measurement. For my own experience, this is easily a programmer's best introduction to Quantum Mechanics ever! Way to go!!</review><course_id>36388</course_id><course_title>Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computation</course_title><reviewer_id>1372</reviewer_id><review_date>2013-04-22</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Before this course I just wanted to learn some "Quantum Mechanics" out of curiosity. My previous exposures to the field were all informal, but very enthusiastic. Specifically, many on-line lectures (that I could hardly understand), many skipping through books, but not actually solving problems, because my mechatronics undergraduate degree just steals much of my time. After the course, even though I found the first talks about computing boring, as soon as I saw the words "quantum gates" I got interested again. I have seen some of those before, and that made it more interesting. Now I want to (be the first physicist to) build a quantum computer. I think this was just the right push I needed. Maybe the only downside, would be that stupid Grover´s Algorithm hahaha I had no previous knowledge of complexity but don´t give up just because it is not easy. Note: I would say I expended 10-15 hours a week but coursetalk, keeps whining and asking for a whole number.</review><course_id>36388</course_id><course_title>Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computation</course_title><reviewer_id>1371</reviewer_id><review_date>2013-04-22</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Having had a background in Quantum Mechanics, I took this course to gain an insight into Quantum Information and Computation, something I was eager to do ever since I completed my Master's(in Physics). I felt that the course did what it promised, i.e. provide a simple and concise introduction to Quantum Computation. The lectures were stimulating and were well aided/complimented by the assignments and the examinations. A better background in Computer Science would have complimented my learning, but the flipside is that someone with a computer science background would argue that an idea of quantum mechanics would have helped in the learning process, and that's where I think CS191x does a great job, i.e. to effectively bring to students around the world Quantum mechanics and Computation by seamlessly straddling elements of quantum physics and computer science. Credit should also go to the edX team for organizing this course and bringing it to so many people around the world.</review><course_id>36388</course_id><course_title>Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computation</course_title><reviewer_id>1370</reviewer_id><review_date>2013-04-22</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Definitely a 5 star course. In my opinion the most interesting subject that humanity has ever encountered. Clearly presented by the charismatic Professor Vazirani. I have a degree in physics from 35 years ago and have recently been trying to learn about quantum computing by reading about it but this course is a much better way of understanding the subject. The format of lectures, assignments and exams was perfect.

I learned the basics of quantum mechanics and the math behind some of the powerful quantum computing algorithms. The course had high expectations going in and it far exceeded the expectations. I feel as though i honestly learned a lot, and am prepared to start building off this good foundation the course has given me.

In many organizations, knowledge gaps on IT concepts especially among the senior level executives becomes a major hurdle in effectively managing IT. This course will certainly help in bridging this knowledge gap. It covers in sufficient breadth and depth, areas such as how IT can be used for business innovation, improving network security, reducing IT related costs, how to go about building IT systems, leveraging outside innovation to the benefit of business organizations and the social and ethical aspects of IT management. The course materials have been presented in a very interesting and lucid style by Prof Rahul De, who is a great teacher and highly experienced in the field. The case studies have been very interesting and have helped the participants in gaining deeper insights about the concepts covered. The discussion forums for the course have helped the participants to share their views on the topics covered and the teaching assistants have been active in effectively moderating the forums. The videos are of below 10 minute duration and this makes it very convenient for working professionals to learn the topics. The quizzes are helpful in testing the level of mastery of the concepts. Overall, the course is top class. Sincere thanks to the Professor, IIMB and edX for the highly useful course !</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45470</course_id><course_title>Innovation and IT Management</course_title><reviewer_id>112626</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-09-06</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>A very well-organized course to strengthen basic knowledge on IT.

First the nature and relevance of the subject were oulined, along with a brief history of its development. At all times International Law was presented as a dytnamic concept, which was developing as we speak. The examinations were rigorous, thus ensuring that students received a thorough grounding in International law sources. Personally I sense that I have been empowered to look afresh at the world of International affairs and to re-evaluate institutions such as the United Nations and the Security Council, which we may all take for granted but which few have the opportunity to study. I have enrolled for the course on International Human Rights Law as I see the MOOC concept, and especially its delivery through EDX, as pointing to the future of education. Perhaps the most enjoyable aspect of the course was the Q&amp;A sessions which Professor d'Argent always conducted in an affable and accessible manner, even though he was often inundated by questions. The discussion fora were also marvellous, and I only wish I had used them more.</review><course_id>42210</course_id><course_title>International Law</course_title><reviewer_id>113090</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-09-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>International law Pierre d'Argent i think the course is a very good one.

I found the lectures exceptional in their clear presentation and insight on the processes used by the courts. No one, taking this course, can possibly walk away not having learned a great deal about international law. The material was very interesting (throughout) and well-organized. For me, studying legal terms and seeing them used, in context, was exceptionally good. The same words are used repeatedly; quickly students become familiar with and confident in applying them.

I humbly commend Professor d'Argent for the quality of the content, the passion of profession informing that quality, and -- to be quite frank -- the boldness of presenting to the native-English-speaking layperson his wealth of knowledge via an 8-week INTENSE course in a non-native tongue. Wow. Well done, Sir. This was a 1st edition of the course, and yet it was a superior experience. I'm sure the 2nd edition will improve on the program's existing strengths. Professor d'Argent and the staff are friendly and responsive, and the platform is quite easy to navigate. From a student's perspective, I was most heartily engaged with the theoretical content. This, of course, could result from a personal predilection or disposition of mind. Specifically, the conceptual bases of the existence of IL and of the reach of its role and, if I may, the permissibility of it in the global forum, pique my interest most. Now, when I read the news, I will read with a more informed and critical mind. Now, when I vote, I will do so with a more robust understanding of the international implications of the potential policy decisions of prospective leaders. That's an asset, and thank you. All in all, an amazing experience. I will be sure to follow Louvain and Professor d'Argent on edX and other MOOC platforms. Many thanks for an enriching experience, and my sincere compliments to the team.</review><course_id>42210</course_id><course_title>International Law</course_title><reviewer_id>110518</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-07-15</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Challenging, excellent course with a very competent and highly skilled Professor, able to make tricky and difficult terms easily or more easily understood even from people with little or no background in the subject matter.

The scope is necessarily limited but I was happy with what it covered, there is always the option to look into topics further on your own. I found the Prof very clear, sometimes too clear and I often played the videos at 1.25x normal speed to keep it moving along. The guy knows what he's on about and is clearly interested in the topic himself, and that is contagious, in a good way. I agree with the course description that it is an intermediate course, though if english isn't your first language or its been a while since you had to do much in the way of studying I can see how it might be considered advanced.</review><course_id>42210</course_id><course_title>International Law</course_title><reviewer_id>110390</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-07-08</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course has impressed me a lot.

I liked the interviews and the reading material provided was very helpful. I would definitely enroll to another MOOC that’s related to this one or from Curtin University. I really enjoyed it.

Thanks so much for a great course. I have been in public relations, communication and marketing for over 25 years and was a little bit cynical about how much I would learn but found I learnt quite a bit. It forced me to think about things more deeply and I loved looking at all the examples listed by other students on the Google+ Community. I am presently working as a marketing consultant to AdelaideX so really needed to complete a course to understand the learner experience so this was great.</review><course_id>47765</course_id><course_title>Digital Branding and Engagement</course_title><reviewer_id>116752</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-12-15</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I had never taken any marketing courses in school or anything but I do work in the marketing field.

It was horrendous! I couldn't listen to the videos and just either skipped over these parts, or read the transcript. I think you either didn't use a lapel mic/boom mic, or used the in camera mic, which is gave the bad audio. Absolutely a blemish on an otherwise great course. And really brand damaging for Curtin, when you're talking about online content production! One other thing with the Curtin produced videos - please don't ask every interviewee to state their name and the place they work at the beginning of every video, very amateurish! Use the name supers which state name, position title and company. It saves time on the video as well. Considering the average viewer only watches less than 2mins of video, some of the longer interviews should've been cut down for brevity and ease of use by students/viewers. The examples were good - global but also Australian and current.</review><course_id>47765</course_id><course_title>Digital Branding and Engagement</course_title><reviewer_id>115690</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Thank you for offering this course. I found it to be very interesting and enlightening. So much has changed in the marketing spectrum since I left varsity, and I was rather unaware of it, now I have a much better knowledge base of these changes as well as how to utilize digital branding in the future. The course was relative, interesting and well researched. It's not easy sourcing all that information.

I am sure that provided the MOOC is kept up to date it could be run at least once a year. High Lights Very pleased to achieve 100% in the first quiz, and 90% in the second and fourth quiz. Downloads detailing the module are excellent; particularly when highlight the parts in still form from the video’s in the particular module. This was very helpful for revision before the quiz. Length of the MOOC was just about right in 4 weeks – I complete about 6 MOOC’s a year and this focal point for my lifelong learning. MOOC’s that last 4 to 6 weeks are ideal and my favourite subjects for research and learning are about creativity, innovation and change. Looking at Digital in the marketing area was probably outside my comfort zone! Disappointments too Disappointed that I only achieved 70% in the third quiz should have done better While some of the downloads in module have been excellent, the ones that were just a record of video in word form were very poor – such a shame when standards have been so high. There is tendency with MOOC providers to under estimate the time required to complete the course, stating for instance – time for study 3 hours per week. I am dyslectic a slow reader and I find usually I have to spend double the time indicated. Found the addition references at end of each module very useful to build a greater understanding of the subject. Unfortunately these have not always been checked before the start the MOOC. With WQMMA the page had been removed so it needs additional research to find out more!

I spent a lot of time reading additional materials - I also purchased several books mentioned by Professor Jose. What I really loved about the course was the 'Thought leader' interviews. I looked them up, followed them on twitter and read more news about them. What I thought could improve on the next round was, the assignments. I think it tested what I remember than what I actually learnt. Overall, I enjoyed taking this course, it was enlightening and I could draw parallels to the firm I work for. Thanks a lot Professor Jose and hope to see another round of this course soon!</review><course_id>47761</course_id><course_title>Strategy and the Sustainable Enterprise</course_title><reviewer_id>115121</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-04</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>The course has been designed in an appropriate manner with adequate examples and interviews from experts.It has helped me to gain insight into some of the most needed topics.Looking forward more such courses in future.</review><course_id>47761</course_id><course_title>Strategy and the Sustainable Enterprise</course_title><reviewer_id>115115</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-03</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>The course offered a well-balanced insight on the concepts of Sustainability and corporate strategies to deal with various issues a corporate could be vulnerable to. This was also an opportunity to hear from Prof Jose and other renowned experts sharing their thoughts on the subject. The case studies are chosen appropriately, that emphasize the concepts - and also the need for the corporations to have right strategy to deal with Sustainability, and associated risks. I wish, length of videos be no longer that 4-5 minutes. I would like to thank Prof Jose and his team for offering this course.</review><course_id>47761</course_id><course_title>Strategy and the Sustainable Enterprise</course_title><reviewer_id>115112</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-03</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course has done an excellent job of light on the practicalities of taking sustainability from a concept to a business reality.

I learned the important inter-relationships between business objectives and stakeholders' strategies, and the way to align the overall strategy for the collective good. I have a supply chain background and the sustainability dimension fits perfectly in the physical dynamics of the material flow within the cradle to cradle loop.

The course is aimed more at new entrants or mid level managers who have had a few years of experience. Nevertheless, even for a senior management person like me, it was a great learning opportunity. I especially liked the Stakeholders Framework and the new 3.0 version of the BoP model. Fascinating insights here. What I was looking out for was contemporary examples, which were missing. For instance the Coca-cola issues with ground water, Nestle's losing battle with Maggi though they are big in Shared Value. Perhaps the course can be dynamic and real time in that nature, by incorporating latest stories and corporate examples.</review><course_id>47761</course_id><course_title>Strategy and the Sustainable Enterprise</course_title><reviewer_id>115035</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-02</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Excellent online learning place with excellent instructor and content.

We've been driven to believe that we have to go and live in the poorest places or stop making profit if we want to create sustainable development. This course has proven this assumptions false. Professor Jose explained himself excellently, and the team in charge of the videos and the elements in them was outstanding. They could explain this subject in a way that an unexperienced person as myself could understand perfectly. This will help me greatly in my career as architect, and it will surely help any person in any other discipline.</review><course_id>47761</course_id><course_title>Strategy and the Sustainable Enterprise</course_title><reviewer_id>115006</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-01</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course was a much desired refresher for me personally having spend my corporate life , full of deadlines and demands of success metrics.

The EdX and IIM team of Prof.Jose and the support functions deserve special accolades for the super work and research they have put forth in. As a matter of fact I used to look forward to Tuesday's to see what's next ! Please do let us know about any advance course that would be available to candidates completing this course in future.

If you are interested in the principles of supply chain management and the way supply chain professionals look at logistical problems, this is definitely the course for you. The broad topics covered are demand forecasting, inventory management, and transportation management. Each one of them receives an appropriate level of coverage, although inventory management turns out to take up the most time, merely because it is such a complicated subject. The amount of course material is very manageable for anyone, whether you are a student or a full-time working professional like myself who only has time in the evenings and on weekends. My only (minor) issue is that some problems require some outside help, but the discussion forums are useful and the TAs are frequently available.</review><course_id>34817</course_id><course_title>Supply Chain Fundamentals: MITx MicroMaster's Credential in Supply Chain Management</course_title><reviewer_id>61298</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-12-19</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Well, i have just finished the graded asignments for the week 10.

The videos are ok, and maybe a little outdated. The content is average so far and consists of just statistics applied to supply chain problems. It is a management course as opposed to an engineering/science course so that is understandable I guess. Assignments are management style... so math problems followed by opinionated multiple choices. The potential of a MicroMasters degree (and the subsequent promise of an actual degree at MIT) are big 'if's and really just carrots on a stick IMO. You have to slog it out for 1.5 years and pay USD1500 before you get a chance to apply to the actual degree and then you have to spend around 40k for the one semester that you spend at MIT. It is a fact that in the real world no one cares about online degrees. So you are really taking the course for the knowledge. But course policy is such that the graded assignment solutions are never released. So if you get anything wrong you never know the answer? plus you get the added bonus of losing sleep over where you messed up. Also you get some parts of the course only if you pay the course fees! YEP... the innovative folks at MIT have chanced upon the revolutionary (sarcasm) idea of DLC for online learning... way to go guys. I am making an A in the course currently, so I am tempted to stick around a little longer as this is just my 2nd week. Maybe they will reveal some secret MIT knowledge in the later weeks that will make my wasted time worthwhile.

He might have a few equals, but is second to none in teaching. Not just knowledgeable but extremely engaging as well as deeply enthusiastic. Plus, true to MIT standards, Professor Caplice assumes that the students are intelligent adults; and thus never belabors relatively obvious points. This course covers a ton of material and manages to cover it both quickly and in depth. It is very demanding, worth every minute. Every supply chain professional would benefit from this course.</review><course_id>34817</course_id><course_title>Supply Chain Fundamentals: MITx MicroMaster's Credential in Supply Chain Management</course_title><reviewer_id>116764</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-12-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course content is best in class.

TA's are heplful in giving assistance and guidance. I couldn't wait every week to the next lesson. For me, this course was quite a challenge in terms of my previous background, but I found it so interesting and well organized that I made it. I those places were I was wrong, I learned from my mistakes. VERY IMPORTANT: there are practice question sessions with no grade. This is a very helpful feature, kind of "playground" were you can just learn and see what your weak points are in the lesson. CONS? personally I do not find one of those.

The projects are interesting, with a medium to high level of difficulty. I have a BS in computer science, but wanted to learn Python. This course and the companion course in data science provide an excellent introduction to programming with Python. MIT has it's finger on the pulse of modern computing. This is a good course for people who want to bring their knowledge up to date. Eric Crimson and John Guttag are both clear communicators and excellent teachers, who have designed a unique and interesting course. I do have one problem with the course. Students can get credit through Charter Oak State College, which requires a grade of 80%! In this course, a score of 80 percent is an "A" and students should not have to ace the course to be eligible for credit. The usual standard for academic credit is a passing grade (55% = C).</review><course_id>14094</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python</course_title><reviewer_id>117843</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-01-23</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course is a challenging, information-rich, and fascinating introduction to computer science and Python.

Transcripts provided help a bit. The way of teaching is different from the western one - it feels more like punishment than participation for a student. The course lacks in practice problems and exercise. Professor’s explanations are very concise and not enough to completely understand the matter so you are forced to do a lot of additional research on the net. But the timeline is very tight. So you have to work on the graded questions (with just 1 attempt!) not having enough understanding yet, but when you fail they do not explain what was wrong. You did not learn from your mistakes yet but must start with the next module. And so on. No wonder that the passing score is just 60%. I have passed it but did I learn the predictive analytics? NO.</review><course_id>49420</course_id><course_title>Predictive Analytics</course_title><reviewer_id>117856</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-01-23</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>It was amazing course, very informative and detailed course content and examples.

The course starts by introducing what problems are being faced by businesses worldwide and how predictive analytics can be used to address those problems. It then takes you through the most prevalent predictive analytic techniques, how do they work internally, how they can be applied to the given problem, shows model checking and validation and what corrective actions to take in case of discrepancies. There are examples of model building in Excel and SPSS. By giving only 1 attempt at the exercises, the course forces you to think through each of the problems rather than resorting to any guesswork. What sets it apart from other courses is that it covers only what is necessary in a clear, concise and compact manner. It also address most of the common doubts new learners have through lectures, webinar and discussion forums. If the course can give model building examples in R or Python as well and increase the number of exercises, it will greatly enhance the value of this course.</review><course_id>49420</course_id><course_title>Predictive Analytics</course_title><reviewer_id>117809</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-01-21</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Excellent course and teacher.

This course gives an in-depth overview on how to use these powerful features. The course is accessible to those who use Excel for data analysis and presentation but also for those (like myself) who have used the Microsoft BI services stack and wish to be more productive. In other words, an excellent course that does justice to this powerful product. The edX platform worked well, serving up clear videos, practice questions and labs. It was easy to download the course materials and grading worked well. The same cannot be said about coursetalk: the rating stars did not show up in IE11, a very common browser. This forced me to try to find another browser and start all over again. Do you guys ever test or is that too old-fashioned.</review><course_id>50913</course_id><course_title>Analyzing and Visualizing Data with Power BI</course_title><reviewer_id>116725</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-12-15</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Excellent course. I am a beginner with fair knowledge of Excel. This course knowledge would provide more opportunities for me in analyzing my organization data. Would like to request the course organizers if the students can have access to sample online databases in different fields (other than sales and revenue), say healthcare and financials, etc. where the students relevant to the field can access and practice.</review><course_id>50913</course_id><course_title>Analyzing and Visualizing Data with Power BI</course_title><reviewer_id>116716</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-12-15</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>Given I am working on Tableau, this is one of the course which helped me to pick up a BI tool very fast. Firstly the product is becoming excellent day by day and is really easy to use. Recommendation would be provide: 1. more reading and more and more example to try hands on may be on the Desktop version. 2. Create some case and then do the visualization to help bring the creative side of the though process of using the tool. 3. Very importantly cover more topics on data mining using DAX and visualization for exploratory analysis. 4. Integration of statistical analysis would be also helpful.</review><course_id>50913</course_id><course_title>Analyzing and Visualizing Data with Power BI</course_title><reviewer_id>120157</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-04-07</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>PowerBI course provides good guidance to understand the technicalities associated with better and easy way.

Power BI brings together the Power suite of MS BI tools Power Query, Power Pivot, Power View all used from the Power BI desktop (or Power BI service) to help you ETL, model and report on your data. The Power BI reporting environment as an excel brand feel to it and gives you an easy to learn platform for generating professional reports. These reports consist of many views(tiles) which you then can pick and choose which tiles to put into your dashboards. With the investment MS are putting into Power BI with itsregular (weekly) updates means Power BI will become a major player in the BI reporting arena. Though with the regular updates it could mean that this course becomes quickly outdated. So do take that into consideration when starting this course. I believe this course is based on the Nov 2015 version of Power BI (PBI). As this course completes the December version of PBI already is offering enhanced features. Great product , great course. Keep your skills upto dat and learn how to use Power BI now.</review><course_id>50913</course_id><course_title>Analyzing and Visualizing Data with Power BI</course_title><reviewer_id>116959</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-12-22</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>A nice one!

Additionally the discussion forum was very beneficial and the participation was great. I felt the balance of videos and labs was good and the quality of the videos, presentations, and presenter was excellent.

It helped me greatly in achieving band 6.5 from the first time. The content is very rich and interactive, also the instructors are giving as much details about the exam and its tips as possible. It covers all sectors of the exam, and provides the learners with the enough vocabulary. I have only one kind notice, that it needs to provide more practice tests. Apart from that, It was an amazing experience.</review><course_id>48087</course_id><course_title>IELTS Academic Test Preparation</course_title><reviewer_id>117613</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-01-14</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I joined this class one week ago and i found it as one of the best available free complete training for ILETS exam, I would like to thanks edX and Queensland University , best wishes.</review><course_id>48087</course_id><course_title>IELTS Academic Test Preparation</course_title><reviewer_id>117143</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-12-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>hey, i just want to thank you all, just checked my results and i passed so well. had 7.5, that's so cool. i used barely a week to prepare.

As a yoga instructor I was disappointed that there was no mention of yoga as either a fitness or healing modality. But I did gain helpful insights into knee and shoulder injuries. The instructors were all clear, well-organized and concise. I particularly enjoyed all the Cirque du Soleil footage. On a more technical note, I found some of the graphics on the powerpoint hard to read. Also, I had paid to get a certificate, and was mortified to learn that I had missed the deadline for two of the quizzes because all of the activities preceding them stated that the deadline was at the end of the course, yet the first two quizzes were due much earlier.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>28165</course_id><course_title>The Body Matters: Why Exercise Makes You Healthy and How to Stay Uninjured</course_title><reviewer_id>74512</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-05-06</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>What I really liked about this course was that it looked at the whole issue of fitness and the importance of keeping active from a scientific perspective - i.e. it wasn't pushing one particular viewpoint but rather presenting all the evidence and inviting participants to consider it. It helped that Dr Shrier manages to combine being authoritative with a keen sense of humour. I also learned more about anatomy on this course than I have in several decades of being a personal injury lawyer....I'll now have a far better idea of how to read medical reports.

The course itself is full of interesting useful information highly relevant to people all over the world and is taught in a style that I believe is accessible to non-academics. I strongly urge anyone considering this course to take it if it stays on as a self-paced course. I believe the course team have done a fantastic job in producing interesting and relevant lectures, so far, but badly fell short in the area of grading where they have adopted a ridiculous practice of random student grading which results in a random mark based on the whims of the random student who gets to grade your hard work. I would have given the course a 5 star but because of the very bad grading system they have adopted I could only give them a three at most. It is too bad that the course team at McGill took what could have been a fabulous course and messed it up with this absurd grading system.</review><course_id>26686</course_id><course_title>Natural Disasters</course_title><reviewer_id>117045</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-12-24</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>I took the course before but missed some lectures. I hope that this session (Jan. '16) could supply us with the ability to download lecture slides in addition to the videos, and texts. I had to supply my own slides from Google images in order to better supplement the lectures. It was a long and tedious process to do so.

It was PACKED with information on how weather/El Niño works, earthquakes, landslides, tornados, floods... yes, it had some math in it! I thought this was an excellent course, giving more than a glossing-over of the science behind these phenomena - it is definitely a course any city planner/emergency planning committee should have to take!</review><course_id>26686</course_id><course_title>Natural Disasters</course_title><reviewer_id>111962</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-08-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I thought the course was well designed and full of information/knowledge. The instructors were outstanding. However, I was compelled to drop out sometime in midstream beacuse I was discouraged by technology- issues I encountered using my IPad in doing the course. There were several instances when I could not make the test graphics work. Struggling with them simply took too much time and effort that I decided to drop out. I could have used my laptop instead but I was mostly on the go a lot at the time and my IPad was I thought a much easier equipment to use given my situation at the time. I wish the course will be offered again.</review><course_id>26686</course_id><course_title>Natural Disasters</course_title><reviewer_id>74089</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-04-20</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I absolutely LOVED this course. so far, it's the best course I took on edX :D ... everything about it was amazing, great topics, remarkable presentation, very organized and interesting, even the assignments were so well-presented, clear and fun. my only regret is that I started this course very late, so I missed the chance to submit 2 assignments and so :( .. and by that I lost the opportunity to get a certificate and/or honor code.

I live in an area of the world that is rarely affected by natural disasters and it was truly awesome to see the enormous power that nature can release, together with the terrible consequences for humans.

Being that I'm a wife and mom going back to university this summer to continue my goal to obtain a degree in earth and atmospheric sciences with a focus in weather forecasting, natural disasters and emergency management, I found this course exceeded my expectations. The course material content was very in-depth and the two professors were very engaging, The set up of the student dashboard and course-ware was excellent, and my experience during this course was outstanding! I found myself looking forward to the lectures and the increasing knowledge. i especially loved the availability of the video lecture 'transcripts' which where synchronized with each lecture video. The synchronized transcripts made it such that I could read along while watching the lecture videos, when (on a few occasions) open audio nor headset was advantageous in my home environment. The Teacher Assistants were exemplary as well, and answered any student questions or concerns in a prompt and thorough manner. Overall, it eased my education jitters usually experienced by middle-aged individuals returning back to university to continue their goal of obtaining a degree, at this point in life. I learned a great deal, and found myself wishing their was a second level course. I'm so glad I took this course. Thanks Professors Gyakum and Stix, the McGillx (University) Team and edX for offering this wonderful and interesting course.</review><course_id>26686</course_id><course_title>Natural Disasters</course_title><reviewer_id>74029</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-04-13</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Very interesting informations are provided and the material goes quite deep into meteorology and geophysics.

I now understand (in great detail) the science behind disasters, I know how to spot the potential threats, &amp; I'm aware of how to prepare for/avoid disasters. The only part of the course that I wasn't a huge fan of was the peer assessment portion of the final project - I'm not sure that they were best suited for grading responsibilities, but as long as the rest of the coursework is completed, even a poor peer assessment won't mess up your grade that much.

The teaching assistants were good and right on top of everything. You McGill folks are great. I am not used to MOOCs, so submitting the writing assignment was awkward. I expected my first submission to be carried over from the self to the peer assessment, and that has been done in other MOOCs. Additional photos of mine overwrote the previous one I submitted, making it awkward to submit a full project all at once. Perhaps you can get your programmers to allow submission of pdfs. I have seen that. Other than that, well done. ,,</review><course_id>26686</course_id><course_title>Natural Disasters</course_title><reviewer_id>52617</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-08-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The video lectures were good.

I wish the Final Projects had been more enhanced and perhaps directed to a side platform for rating and discussion (as for the TechniCity course on Coursera).

Soy ingeniero electrónico y estaba interesado en esta área hace mucho tiempo, al ver el curso en la lista decidí inscribirme lo más pronto posible. Me gustó mucho que usaran una librería opensource para explicar, igualmente estoy consciente del contenido, no se puede abarcar lo máximo pero de nuevo, me gustó mucho como llevaron el tema. Los felicito! (Otra vez) Ahora, lo único que si les recomiendo que mejoren es la velocidad de las cosas, por ejemplo, sé que está en tu forma de hablar, soy venezolano, por eso creo que hablan bastante rápido jajaja. Sin embargo creo que hay videos que deberían hablar un poco más lento y modular más (No es como para decir que no se entendió nada). Y no sé si podrían dejar las lecciones de C en forma escrita, ya que ese instructos si hablaba mucho más rápido. Nota 100%! No he tenido tiempo de realizar las aplicaciones por cuestiones de trabajo, pero de aquó a poco las tendré listas. Esperando la versión dos del curso. Agradecido por compartir su conocimiento.

This course is a nice introduction to astrobiology and life itself - so if you have no scientific background, you'll still be able to get by. The forums were bursting with discussions, so I believe everybody could have find the way to be successful in this course, no matter the background. This course was much more text-oriented rather than video oriented, so this is its major flaw. The texts were great and informative, with lots of interactive visualizations, but e-courses tend to focus on videos as lectures which engage you in a way you feel as if you're taking a real course. Otherwise, everyone could just read a textbook on astrobiology. So, I recommend the staff for the next iterations to try to record the texts into smaller lectures - it will be easier to follow for students, and for those that want to go in more detail, there would be texts. Although, there were amazing interview videos with important scientists, so this is a plus. The major plus is the involvement of the instructors in the forums, which is not that often, so kudos.</review><course_id>34816</course_id><course_title>Super-Earths And Life</course_title><reviewer_id>114455</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-10-18</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>As someone who has been out of the education scene and working for the past few years I found this course an amazing refresher.

If you have previous knowledge in basic physics and biology and can solve high school math, this will still be quite an informative course but not very challenging. I enjoyed the course but found it too short (I completed it in several hours over 2 days) but it was enough of a 'sampler' for me to decide whether to continue with the topic. I signed up for the edx xseries astrophysics after completing this course. The course itself is good and I learnt quite a lot in such a short time but it could be a lot better if it included more videos, lectures and interactive sections.

I also believe that real life examples, such as in the form of case studies of corporations is more helpful, interesting and stim ulating, esp. as Sr.Executives, Professionals with more than a decade of experience, are not used to go back to the traditional classroom teaching, as we are used to precise hands-on data and pr oblem solving approach, which is a very pragma tic and first hand approach to running corporatio ns. The Instructor : It has been a very long time for Me to learn from an Indian teacher, and so hone stly speaking I had quite a bit of trouble in unders tanding the accent and the pronunciation of word s by Professor Gupta. Not the least, the Audio co uld have been of the highest quality and the Editi ng part could have enabled Professor Gupta, to i nclude more content. But I guess, that, as we Ind ians have a knack to get around anything &amp; so I did too come around nicely.

However, the video's of a speaker speaking most of the time is old styled classroom training and more practical or real lifestyle/ reality videos would have made the instruction dissemination more powerful. The time bound nature of the course is not required, since for example on account of my exams I could not get time for the last two modules and thus could not give the exams on time and missed out on certification.

Se requieren apropiadas políticas públicas que regulen su aprovechamiento y distribución entre los diversos sectores usuarios: público-urbano, agrícola, industrial, turístico, y para los usuarios indefensos: el medio ambiente y las futuras generaciones, quienes deben recibir una asignación previa a la distribución para que no entren en competencia donde seguramente seguirán siendo los grandes perdedores.</review><course_id>47760</course_id><course_title>Agua en América Latina: Abundancia en medio de la escasez mundial | Water in Latin America: Abundance amid scarcity</course_title><reviewer_id>113603</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-09-28</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>El curso de por si, nos coloca en un posible escenario geopolitico frente a los distintos cambios climáticos que cada vez son mas frecuentes y tendrían repecursion en un recurso de tanta importancia como el agua.

The IDE targeted by the instructors is really awful. Said that, this is really THE best laboratory course ever. The final project is simply the best possible one and the fun factor plus the feeling of constant accomplishment pushes students to try to compensate for the missing information and to dedicate days, weeks, months building and testing advanced electronics. The course is quite hard for anyone that don't have experience in programming and for any student that don't have experience in digital and analog electronics. Not recommended if you have never been exposed to both programming and electronics.</review><course_id>48093</course_id><course_title>Embedded Systems - Shape The World</course_title><reviewer_id>117038</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-12-24</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Very thorough course.

It would be more valuable to record real lectures and put them online. The course material provided is not sufficient to complete the course if one has no prior experience with embedded systems (ES). The course material consist of copy-paste paragraphs from prof. Valvano's book but often it is hard to understand it without the context. The book itself is too verbose and sometimes not easy to follow since you forget what the author is trying to say. At the same time often it does not explain things in detail. Since I was a greenhorn in ES I gave up the course. I am willing to take this course again since I think that with a little bit of background in MCU this course might be fun (oh, btw CCS v6.1 is now available for Linux and MacOS). If you have no prior experience with ES do not expect that only the course material teach you something and you will understand MCUs. I recommend first to read the book "Introduction to Embedded Systems" from M. Jimez et al. prior taking this course. Amazing book that explains hardware implementation of the MCU and its peripherals, programming concepts, many well documented code examples, ADC, Timers, Clock systems, Serial communication, MCU interfacing with LCD, switches, stepper motors and much more. It is very well organized and things are explained in great detail including real word troubles you may have to handle when implementing something. After reading this book prof. Valvano's course will be much more fun.</review><course_id>48093</course_id><course_title>Embedded Systems - Shape The World</course_title><reviewer_id>120060</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-04-04</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Amazing amount of content and depth for an online course, very accessible for a small investment in hardware and lots of fun.</review><course_id>48093</course_id><course_title>Embedded Systems - Shape The World</course_title><reviewer_id>118855</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-02-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The potential behind an exceptional idea starts with the potential of ones own ability and the depth and capability as would be applied.

Of the courses I've completed (and yes I completed this one), it was by far the most disappointing. I felt the instructor is very biased and that her videos were just about promoting her own point of view. The online textbook was instructional and all the quiz questions are based on the book not the videos. The online discussions were of very poor quality, due I think to lack of appropriate prompts from the instructor. Finally, the idea of writing a 4-5 page paper and peer grading other students' long papers is not an appropriate assignment for a class where you learn next to nothing. I don't take online classes to just read a textbook online, but am looking for a more complete and satisfying learning experience with instructor videos, discussion board interaction, and well-designed learning activities. I look forward to another offering on EdX in the area of Sociology to get a good, well-balanced introduction to this area of study.</review><course_id>45474</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Sociology</course_title><reviewer_id>113793</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-10-01</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>The course was interesting, and exploring different sociological perspectives and approaches to concepts was cool! But, the course is rather US-centric - as well as the textbook - which could be looked into in the hope of diversifying the scope of the course. I do understand that there's a restriction due to time and resource constraints. Nonetheless, an interesting introductory course to sociology!</review><course_id>45474</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Sociology</course_title><reviewer_id>113781</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-10-01</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>Thanks for a really interesting course, Joanna. I have enjoyed it, though haven't quite completed yet because I found it rather dense and heavy going in comparison with other edx courses I've done/am doing. It's a bit disappointing that such a high level of engagement doesn't result in some kind of formal recognition at tertiary level. It was also a little frustrating that so many topics were covered in a somewhat superficial way - though I do appreciate that we were being introduced to Sociology and as such, you were probably trying to whet our appetites across the discipline as a whole - and it does cover a lot of territory. One small thing which I think affects presentation is that there were quite a lot of typos and grammatical errors in the materials presented. Overall though, I enjoyed it. Thank you.</review><course_id>45474</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Sociology</course_title><reviewer_id>113746</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-09-30</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I think the instructor was too biased in her findings and studies and didn't focus on teaching at all.

There were a few minutes of commentary by the instructor which were mostly biased comments and her views. She was more interested in getting to buy into her politics and social positions than in educating you. The book wasn't the best, but it wasn't bad and it was a lot better than she was. I've taken way worse courses, but I hate it when someone is trying to manipulate me. Especially when that person is suppose to be an unbiased and fair presenter of information.</review><course_id>45474</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Sociology</course_title><reviewer_id>113706</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-09-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Well, I can't deny the knowledge gained with this course. As I stated somewhere, I think the readings are too demanding, that is too long for short time, also taking into account that I have really spent considerable time to read everything that is compulsory. As the rest of the course is concerned, it is all perfect. Bad thing is I have just noticed that there is work pending I haven't done, so I am feeling quite bad.

It is pretty amazing that content of such high quality has been made available for free! My undergrad degree was in neuroscience, and I found this free course to be of equal or greater quality and value than any of the $500+ psychology/neuroscience courses I have ever taken. The weekly practices were a fantastic way to encourage behavioral change. Many university courses seem to contain fascinating information but no guidance in integrating the information into your daily life. The weekly practices in this course made it possible for me to actually integrate the course material into my life and experience the benefits on a daily basis.</review><course_id>14337</course_id><course_title>The Science of Happiness</course_title><reviewer_id>114960</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-10-30</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I am enjoying the research and the course but I probably should have taken it when I had more time. Another factor for me in terms of personal impact--and it is a huge factor--is that I lost my mother and two other family members in a ten day period a little over six months ago. I am usually a rather content person but I have been grief-stricken and my "check-in" scores are not going to even be near the average.

It addresses each of the supply chain processes and the design considerations that go into those processes. The course wraps up with the prevalent organizational structures and the metrics for measuring the performance. Many of the practitioners would be working in a particular area of the supply chain and this course helps develop a comprehensive overview of the whole chain and the interdependencies of his function with the other interfacing functions. Similarly for software professionals and consultants working in a particular area, it provides a complete overview and also helps in developing a good understanding of the logic (S&amp;OP, optimization, MRP, ATP) that goes into the functioning of the software. With respect to the course content, I suggest inclusion of the following either within the existing topics or as additional topics- 1. Little's law and the concepts of lean manufacturing 2. Theory of Constraints 3. Cellular manufacturing As the course is further developed, MIT can consider making the problems broad based with respect to the industry content. For example, blending problems of the process industries, model mix problems in the auto industry etc.</review><course_id>47683</course_id><course_title>Supply Chain Design</course_title><reviewer_id>116558</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-12-08</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I'm enrolled to SC1x and SC3x.

Also a good basic refresher on financial and cost accounting from a managerial perspective. In this class you will get a lot of practice with using linear programming to solve network flow and other problems. Be forewarned if you don't like setting up LP and MILP models. For me, however, this was one of the best parts of the class. Years ago, in an operations research class, we spent the better part of five weeks grinding through tables by hand to learn the mechanics of the simplex method, integer programming, relaxation, etc. But didn't really touch on useful applications. Then in B-school we solved various abstract network exercises. But this class tied it together into real-world problems, such has facilities location, optimizing shipping costs, etc. One note with respect to software requirements: Most of the problems can be solved with either Libre Office or Microsoft Excel. Some exercises are a little easier if you have access to Excel, as it can save certain parameters which Libre Office cannot. Plus, the Libre Office optimizer can only optimize contiguous blocks of decision variables, while Microsoft office is more flexible in this regard. (And if you don't know what I'm referring to, don't worry... You will learn it in the class. I used Libre Office for 95% of the work.)</review><course_id>47683</course_id><course_title>Supply Chain Design</course_title><reviewer_id>117663</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-01-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I missed this one (SC2x), I'm enrolled to SC1x and SC3x.

I am from Ghana but residing and working here in Italy. I am very happy that I have got certificates for both 101x and 102x . In fact I joined the second part but in the course of it , I realized that the first part which I mixed was also important so I wrote to the University for information on that. Immediately I got a reply and I was advised to pursue that one too if I could. I combined the two programmes from somewhere 10th November and completed the second part on the 4th December. Because the first part was said to be on the site till the end of December 2015, I worked had to complete the programme on the 18th December and got my pass mark of 60% to qualify for the Cert. The second part too, I got 72% but did not continue to submit the peer view assignment because I was not able to pay for the verified certificate so I decided not to go ahead since I would not receive any certificate from that one. I even called Professor Dr Sander Kersten on the phone to explain my situation and he did well to advise me that the course would be reopened in February so I can join it again. In fact I did not know that I have been awarded a certificate but when I revisited my dashboard, I saw that I have been issued a certificate. I was enthused and surprised. The two certificates will give me a competitive advantage over my competitors and also put food on the table. In fact, I spent about 10 to 12 hours a day before I was able to complete the two programmes within two months. Thanks to the Academic Board of Nutrition and Health Department of Wageningen University particularly, Professor Dr Sander Kersten for these valuable courses and his encouraging words.</review><course_id>45517</course_id><course_title>Nutrition and Health Part 2: Micronutrients and Malnutrition</course_title><reviewer_id>117306</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-01-05</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I have enrolled in both courses about nutrición by Wageningen University.

An amazing bonus was also gaining insights into the huge numbers of "real-world" challenges of over nutrition (Part 1) and under nutrition (Part 2).

The lecturer promotes his view strongly - and as noted in another review- the scripted format makes the interjections from the interviewer contrived and stilted, and makes the lecturer come across as hectoring and patronising. (It should be noted that the lecturer's credentials to teach this topic are impeccable - see Wikipedia) Notwithstanding these criticisms, the argument and factual content of the course is very good.

Inger and her team did a great job. I chose to do the assessment, and hope to put my ideas into practice some time over the next few months. The networks that have emerged will continue the benefits beyond the end of the MOOC itself. I found the platform frustrating. Part of this was probably just the huge numbers that ended up participating, and part was the features of the platform itself (mainly in terms of the discussion aspects, which was cumbersome, unreliable and difficult to search or streamline intuitively - if at all). I think the audience was a little unclear at times, too, and maybe it would be better to run separate MOOCs for supervisors, students and (particularly) frends-and-family. Over all, this MOOC provided insights into the doctoral process that complemented the other resources I use. I doubt that the instructors really knew what they were signing up for when they took it on, but huge thanks to all - it was well worth the effort.</review><course_id>47033</course_id><course_title>How to Survive Your PhD</course_title><reviewer_id>116252</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-30</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>An invaluable course assisting PhD students with the emotional side of completing a thesis, I found the course to be engaging, relevant and insightful. I was and am sensing all the emotions and have taken comfort in knowing that I am not alone in these feelings. The course material was accessible and gave us an opportunity over each week to discuss and follow others' observations and personal stories. The discussion area on EdX was difficult to navigate and if one didn't click on posts to follow it was potluck when returning to read follow up conversations. I thoroughly enjoyed the social aspect of the course with twitter feeds, Facebook pages and even the odd f2f meets for coffee organised by various groups. I felt a real part of the MOOC community the whole time and appreciated the feedback on posts, blogs and ideas to keep the hash tag alive. The weekly periscope session with Inger and the team was uplifting, enjoyable and entertaining. I recommend such a course to every PhD student past and present and to supervisors and even perhaps family members in an effort to share the experiences of being a PhD. #survivephd15 &amp; PhD Owls have become a lifeline for me -thanks to all who had a part in bringing it together, in participating and in what is to come.</review><course_id>47033</course_id><course_title>How to Survive Your PhD</course_title><reviewer_id>116250</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-30</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I really loved the readings and the uplifting and humane spirit of this course. It has been inspiring, reassuring and demystifying - a huge credit to Inger and her incredible team. While I was pleased that so many participants found comfort in the highly active online community that developed, I chose to simply dip in and out of the online discussions as needed. They were, for me, too time consuming (and distracting) to keep up with. I chose not to do the final assignment. I felt I'd got enough out of the course and needed to focus on my actual PhD research deliverables. I also felt no need to be assessed/receive the certificate. I would highly recommend this course to anyone undertaking a PhD. It has definitely filled a gap in the market!

The platform is at best functional, but very often confusing and limiting.</review><course_id>47033</course_id><course_title>How to Survive Your PhD</course_title><reviewer_id>116227</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-30</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Superb way to gain an overview of the emotional journey made during a PhD.

I did my own years ago, graduating in 1999. I found the material covered and the way it was put across rang true with my own experience. As a staff developer, I have also co-facilitated sessions for PhD supervisors in the past - some of this material would have been great to share with them. I particularly liked the way Inger's team worked together in so many ways, sharing upfront presentation, collating Periscope and Twitter comments, and presenting a Storify to cover the main points and feedback. I joined the 'PhD Owls' Facebook group set up by Fiona Tito Wheatland and have found that, too, an ongoing source of useful recommendations and links. I would warmly recommend others to take this MOOC next time it is offered.</review><course_id>47033</course_id><course_title>How to Survive Your PhD</course_title><reviewer_id>116224</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-29</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>As a long distance PhD student I found the course so very helpful. It made me feel part of an interested and interesting group, which feels important when you are not working in a dynamic, academic learning environment. I recommend it highly. It was great to hear I was not alone in my experiences this far in, it put much of my angst into perspective. Thank you so much Inga, Katie and All there at ANU for making it so accessible.</review><course_id>47033</course_id><course_title>How to Survive Your PhD</course_title><reviewer_id>116223</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Great course; great materials; mediocre to bad platform (the platform being the course provider/hoster, edX). Dr Mewburn and her team at ANU curated a wonderful set of materials, sourced from a very broad range of fields which, according to the conversation they sparked, covered the emotional rollercoaster of the PhD very well. As someone who is just at the beginning of my PhD path, having taken the MOOC, I now feel much more prepared for what is to come with my research. I also feel much more connected to some of the 13,500 people who were on the course with me. It was great to experience the wealth of experience in the community and to create some links to others. Hopefully those links will strengthen over time. The course was well-paced, and the material formats were varied and of good quality. The Periscope broadcasts were fabulous. The most difficult thing about the MOOC was trying to follow conversations: the edX platform is poor at that. If you take this course, either encourage the ANU team to set up an alternative platform for discussions outside edX - for example, a Facebook or a LinkedIn group, supported by Twitter - or create something yourself. Trying to track and create meaningful conversations was difficult to impossible (most people would post a comment, then never come back to look for responses to their post, in amongst the pages and pages of posts). You will learn heaps from the course, and - if you find some alternative methods to connect with others - you will also enjoy the collegiality.</review><course_id>47033</course_id><course_title>How to Survive Your PhD</course_title><reviewer_id>116221</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>What a wonderful course! Although I had just submitted my PhD, I was still on the email list of my grad office when the email came through promoting this course. I had recently read a blog from the Thesis Whisperer which seemed to echo all of my sentiments about the tumultuous years of my PhD journey, so I thought "What the heck....Better late than never!" I only *wish* that this course had been running during my PhD years. Nonetheless, I still found the material both valuable and reassuring and a bit of a debrief of all that I had experienced during my own journey. Although I received my confirmation a couple of weeks into the course, topics like that on Imposter Syndrome were still so relevant to me and helped me to realise that I wasn't alone in those feelings. I just loved the personality and relaxed approach of Inger and her team which put a human face on the experience, something that you wouldn't really expect in a MOOC course. I recommend this course for any and all PhD students as well as those doing an MPhil. Indeed, while many PhD candidates might not be able to discern the courses that are useful to them, let me assure you that this is perhaps more useful and important than any statistics or research course you will ever do.</review><course_id>47033</course_id><course_title>How to Survive Your PhD</course_title><reviewer_id>116219</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course was invaluable in improving my understanding of the less academic side of academia (i.e. the emotional toll of doing a PhD!).

The course spans 5 weeks including 4 weekly lessons and one week for a final exam. Course topics include descriptive statistics, variable summaries, the shape of distributions and probability. The course has no prerequisites other than having access to Microsoft Excel. You may be able to get by with a free alternative like LibreOffice, but the course lectures use Excel. Grading is based on lecture comprehension questions, exercises, caselets and a final exam. Weekly content in Statistics for Business I consists of a series of relatively short lectures interspersed with comprehension questions, followed by several exercises and caselets to let students apply what they’ve learned. The lectures themselves are well-made strike a good balance between instructor face time and showing spreadsheet operations. The lead instructor, Shankar, is easy to understand and has some lighthearted yet instructive interactions with is brainy assistant Lysa (she’s a plastic brain that sits on his desk.). Each week has a ton of comprehension questions and exercises to let students get practice with the spreadsheet operations and concepts presented in lecture. Hands-on practice is essential for skill building, so having plenty of exercises is a good thing. Statistics for Business I starts out slow, but the pace picks up toward the final lessons. Some students might feel that the last couple of lessons cover too many concepts in one week. Although having plenty of exercises is generally a good thing, the large number of easy, repetitive exercises grew tiresome. The course might benefit from making some of the exercises optional so that students who need more practice can get it, while those who don’t can skip ahead. Statistics for Business I is a good course for learning how to deal with numbers in Excel, but the large of number of graded exercises can make things tedious at times. This course is best suited for beginners in statistics with basic knowledge of spreadsheets and those who know some statistics and want more experience using Excel. Statistics for Business II is set to launch in October 2015. I give Statistics for Business I 4 out of 5 stars: Very good.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45524</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Steel</course_title><reviewer_id>111363</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-08-10</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course was pretty interesting.

I use this medium to say a big thank you to Tenaris for this wonderful opportunity provided and the Tutor/Instructor's team for delivering the course in an understandable manner.</review><course_id>45476</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Oil Country Tubular Goods (OCTG)</course_title><reviewer_id>112171</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-08-30</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>As a Metallurgy and Material Engineer ,this course is helping me to explore the petroleum sector .Certificate will help me in future for progressing my career.</review><course_id>45476</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Oil Country Tubular Goods (OCTG)</course_title><reviewer_id>112149</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-08-29</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I think this course support me greatly as a student in Petroleum Engineering department.I hope if you continue updating courses here including oil&amp;gas topics.</review><course_id>45476</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Oil Country Tubular Goods (OCTG)</course_title><reviewer_id>112148</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-08-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course is quite interesting.

I learnt a lot. My only grief was with the environment of EDX. They should mark the completed parts in the navigation column on the left. I sometimes skipped the questionnaire and noticed it only by looking into a Progress page. The quiz environment - the buttons and the principle how you have two shots - is also annoying for me. This deserves to be redesigned. To Microsoft I have only one comment - I would like to take away more materials, I collected all links below the classes. I noticed I could download the videos but I hope they stay online in full context. I would like to download either the whole course or a compiled document - a textbook. Maybe only edited subtitles + pictures when something important is being shown.

It made me realise that there are a lot of functions and capabilities in Excel that are very useful but am not aware of. It was just frustrating that the Excel 2010 version does not have the full functionality than what was being demonstrated in the course for Excel 2016. Nevertheless, I really appreciate this free course and hope to learn more about analysing and visualising data with Excel.

The course focuses on getting students up to speed with new features and techniques offered in Excel 2016, such as the Excel data model, queries, DAX (a syntax of defining functions) and Power BI, an online productivity service that integrates with Excel. This course assumes you have some familiarity with MS Excel, particularly pivot tables and slicers. You can complete the course with Excel 2010 or 2013, but if you don't have Excel 2016 you'll have to download add ins and you'll have to work slightly harder to complete the assignments. Grading is based on 7 weekly labs and 12 comprehension quizzes. Weekly content in DAT206x consists of one to three short video lectures describing new Excel features followed by a comprehension quiz. The amount of video content per week is usually under 30 minutes, so you shouldn't need to commit more than an hour or two a week to complete the course. The lecture videos have adequate resolution to see cell values and lecturer's presentation is easy to follow. Weeks 1-7 have lab assignments that let you apply the techniques presented lecture. You only get a couple of submissions for most lab and quiz questions, but most questions are not too difficult. Excel for Data Analysis and Visualization is a succinct, informative course on new Excel features that is worth checking out for those interested in going beyond the basics. Using Excel 2016 for this course when it launched only a few months before the course debuted may partially be a ploy to convince Excel users to upgrade, but I can't fault Microsoft for teaching with the latest version of their own product, and I completed the course with Excel 2010 without much difficulty. I give Excel for Data Analysis and Visualization 4 out of 5 stars: very good.</review><course_id>48074</course_id><course_title>Analyzing and Visualizing Data with Excel</course_title><reviewer_id>116591</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-12-10</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I am feeling very well and appreciate that I am very interested to learn this course I am very happy to take part of this course This course leads me at highest level in my career I am very conscious to learn this course Thank you</review><course_id>48074</course_id><course_title>Analyzing and Visualizing Data with Excel</course_title><reviewer_id>116529</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-12-08</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is an exemplary clear, to-the-point and practical course, extremely useful for business users.

I just couldn't make complete sense of some things that were being said. At some points I knew what to do but didn't fully understand what I was doing and at other points I understood what needed to be done but not really how to do it. I'd have to listen to the lectures more than once to pick up key things that were being asked in the quizzes. There was a lot of circle talk and unfinished sentences so I just couldn't follow sometimes but these are my own personal struggles with this course. It was a great course and I'd recommend it to Excel users.</review><course_id>48074</course_id><course_title>Analyzing and Visualizing Data with Excel</course_title><reviewer_id>114736</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-10-25</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>When I started this course I was not sure that I would be seeing so much new and Excel is capable of doing so much for me in a work environment.

Especially useful for people doing analysis on the daily basis. This is not course for absolute beginners, because it jumps directly on topic and if you are not familiar with at least pivot tables, you can have really hard time. Materials provided are excellent and lectures are very well organized. Tests are well aimed on topic. Labs are not simple and force you to think. Instructions are mostly clear and for the hardest parts there are always hints included. Also there are source files for different versions of Excel, so don't worry if you don't have the newest one. Whole videos are made in one cut, so presenter sometimes thinks or misclicks, but I think it looks more natural this way. Overal quality is really good, I have learned a lot and strongly recommend this course.</review><course_id>48074</course_id><course_title>Analyzing and Visualizing Data with Excel</course_title><reviewer_id>114722</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-10-24</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>This was an excellent course. I learned the new features that come with excel. I would recommend it to everyone who has a little experience with excel 2016 and with BI.

Very often he goes into circles or repeats himself which makes it hard to follow the presentation resulting in having to repeat the listening. It also hampers the information uptake. However, I realize that English is not his first language and give him kudos for doing this in English. He also needs to keep water by his side because he gets really dry in his throat and coughs into the listeners’ ears.</review><course_id>48074</course_id><course_title>Analyzing and Visualizing Data with Excel</course_title><reviewer_id>114720</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-10-24</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>It is a good starter course on this material.

Would definitely enjoy a part 2 with more challenging questions. Students will benefit from questions that are not just repeating what was shown on the course video (but perhaps solving a similar problem). Instructor was good, despite an unorthodox and somewhat unnatural presenting skills. On some occasions (for example, the hierarchies in the data model), more clarity is needed with the explanation. Edx are very good. Would like to see two buttons to allow you to check and do a final check withoot having to press check 3 times when you know your answer was right the first time.</review><course_id>48074</course_id><course_title>Analyzing and Visualizing Data with Excel</course_title><reviewer_id>114717</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-10-24</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Overall, I enjoyed the course very much. I got to know exactly what I wanted to know and an intro to Power BI is just what i needed to end with.

I just want to point out some things: - At the very beginning could be made a better explanation about the main advantages of using DataModel instead of an Excel table as well as their uses. It wasn't that clear why I'd use the DataModel. -One think that could be made as well, would be a linked course about how to insert data in a SQL, creating a simple database. It is because this taught course seemed to be dependant on some other features (that I was not aware nor were taught along the course). -And even though the instructor was easy to understand, he didn't look very enthusiastic. So maybe work a bit on it.</review><course_id>48074</course_id><course_title>Analyzing and Visualizing Data with Excel</course_title><reviewer_id>114668</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-10-23</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Absolutely amazing!

However, this course was very useful to me in order to learn the new features of Excel 2016. I usually build data models in MS Access and connect them to Excel. For small subsets of data, this can be done in Excel. I am interested to increase my knowledge in DAX and PowerBI. The course is very well organized and the labs provide hands-on which is a great way to remember what was explained. I would recommend it for people with some analytic experience.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>48074</course_id><course_title>Analyzing and Visualizing Data with Excel</course_title><reviewer_id>114599</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-10-22</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Course is a very impressive demonstration of new capabilities of Excel 2016 and attendant tools. And feeling of capabilities of the new version is mostly positive. Some negative impression take part at achieving of correct work of Excel 2016 together with Excel 2010. Instructor's materials was very clear. But some part of assestments have ambiguities in the explanations or answers. In the sum, course increased my love to the MS Excel.</review><course_id>48074</course_id><course_title>Analyzing and Visualizing Data with Excel</course_title><reviewer_id>114596</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-10-21</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>It was quite difficult, and time-consuming, to connect and upload some course files etc. This could cause people to drop out doing the course in frustration, so should be reviewed.

I am taking this course to equip myself with data manipulation and data analysis skill and most of my knowledge is from precious work experience and informal self-studying. I love the first 3 sets of modules from the course which provide me practical and effective approach to PowerView and PowerQuery and DAX (I am really excited to learn these!). The last part is a bit PR for Microsoft product which is not necessarily relevant to what I want (but good to know actually). I wish they had provided more difficult finger excercise or problem set to help enhance my learning experience. The example data provided in the course is excellent. I am able to keep all these files to play around with what I learned. I vote 4 star for the instructor because I feel like he is a really knowledgeable and data analyst and programmer, and 1 star lost is because of his style of narration (maybe he has a sore throat or so???). Anyway, I highly recommend this course for people who has little or no experience with data analysis and visualization tools such as PivotChart/Table, PowerPivot, PowerQuery... This would be an inspiring start for you to work with advanced Excel tools and other data analysis apps from Microsoft.</review><course_id>48074</course_id><course_title>Analyzing and Visualizing Data with Excel</course_title><reviewer_id>114587</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-10-21</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Great course that opened up a whole world of Excel, (Power Pivot, Power Query) I was aware of but did not understand what it was or would be used for. Seeing a diagram view of a data model and recognising database like relationships, it dawned on me how powerful BI is and how much easier it is than using Excel front end, Access back end VBA driven tools.

I've learned everything I know about CS on the internet and tried most of the different types : \- Written tutorials, some small around one notion, others on a whole language. \- Walkthroughs and videos (like The New Boston). \- Interactive and gamified tutorials (Codecademy's Python, Codeschool, CodeAvengers, and many others). \- iTunes U lectures (Stanford's CS193P - iPhone development) \- Online courses such as Coursera's CS215. \- I've never bought books and never had the need to. And yet, none of this was quite like CS50x. # The lectures The lecture are one of the most important parts of the course, David J. Malan is a great lecturer. He uses clever real life examples to make complicated notions easier, in fact, you don't need any programming experience and it's still useful in non- programming jobs. Unlike many other programming courses, there is a balance between explanations and the actual code itself, not just slides without any context. Because Malan writes the code during the lectures, there are some unexpected events, bugs and typos. And indeed making errors is an important part of the process, so by showing mistakes we can encounter that makes the lectures interactive and close to real life programming. Moreover, there is an emphasis on explaining how stuff really works under the hood while most programming tutorials don't provide this kind of knowledge. There is here little focus on syntax but more on the logic behind computers. # Problem Sets Without a doubt, psets were the other important part of the course. They always involved finding a solution to a given problem, making some task easier using technology, and there often tackled new notions around CS like the structure of a bitmap or how corrupted data is retrieved. The use of the CS50 Appliance, a virtual machine made with all the necessary tools built-in, avoids all the pain related to cross-platform compatibility so we can focus of the code. Like a real life course, you can't gloss over some requirements. The psets are always challenging but doable because we are always taught how to break it down and given a starting point. In the specifications, we are aslo encouraged to write efficient and elegant code. The psets are the core of the course but can even make great challenges for a programmer outside this context. Most of the time is spend using, applying and actually working with the notions so we end up naturally knowing them. I used to struggle a bit with pointers and now they look so easy. # Additional Content Sections: I haven't watched any of them, I guess they are different way of learning. Shorts: They were an in-depth look at either one of the lecture's notions or a new one. Their short format made them interesting to watch. Walkthrough: I never used them for the first half of the psets, but once we moved to harder stuff they were very useful as a guide for the code design and never gave up the solution. # Community The lecture and psets elements already made it a great course, but the novelty here and the important part was making it an online course. And the community part, CS50x Discuss was available on EdX's website, made it the closest you can get to real-life course. There's this real spirit of help that brings people together to find solutions to the psets or discuss around the course's content. What you will learn (among other) \- C \- PHP \- MVC \- Data Types \- Search and sort algorithms \- Asymptotic notation \- Scratch It was memorable and much more than any other learning experience I've ever had online because it successfully managed to make it a journey. CS50x isn't just the quintessential Harvard course, it's now the quintessential online course.</review><course_id>34687</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Computer Science</course_title><reviewer_id>766</reviewer_id><review_date>2012-12-23</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>The main issue with this is the complete lack of translation to the online format. While the on-campus edition looks unimaginably awesome, and the use of C a particularly interesting deviation from typical Python or Java intro courses, it seems as though they put far too much faith in their extensive use of virtual machines, hacker culture and other computer wizardry to scale the chasm between the intimate campus setting and an interactive but often lonely online independence. Pretty much everything is identical here, from the full 60-90 minute lectures uploaded verbatim twice a week to the admittedly very interesting and unique problem sets. Unfortunately, while that hacker mentality would be fantastic when you're surrounded by others on campus and would undoubtedly add a lot to the experience, it is frustrating and interfering when you're by yourself, very far away from Harvard, trying to figure out how to set up an assignment box and then send it over your virtual machine with command prompt, when what you should be doing is learning - or in my case, going for a walk or something, as in boredom and irritation with the poor online structure, I gave up entirely. On the bright side, the content is fantastic and would love to have a bit more pampering on the delivery side. If you can slog through the lectures (which again have fantastic atmosphere on campus), there's much to be learned, especially with so much interaction with TAs and so on. However MITs offering on the same website and Udacity's CS101 are much more suited for the online medium. It is the use of C that makes Harvard so tantalising, but if you're just beginning it doesn't really matter what language you begin with anyway.</review><course_id>34687</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Computer Science</course_title><reviewer_id>52603</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-08-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>As an aspiring mathematician and scientist with an interest in tech, I have always wanted to learn computer science and programming in my free time, but to this day I have signed up for and given up on countless online courses due to a lack of motivation. Then I found edX, and then I found CS50x. I signed up just to try it, but halfway through the first lecture I was hooked and knew that I was going to complete this course no matter what it takes. I am not fully done with it yet, but so far David J. Malan has been an incredibly great speaker, a fun teacher, and every lecture has made me wish I was studying at Harvard. There is an energy to the entire course that just makes you want to keep fighting even when the problems get particularly hard to crack. It's very challenging, which makes it even more fun. And the best thing is that if you didn't understand something in the lecture, you can rewatch it, or you can watch a walkthrough for that program, or you can watch the section for that week, or you can watch a walkthrough, OR you can go to the Facebook group/Stack Exchange and ask the community of students to help you. There is an incredible amount of material available for this course, which I am very grateful for. This is the first MOOC I will have ever completed, and I thank the Harvard staff for that.</review><course_id>34687</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Computer Science</course_title><reviewer_id>1086</reviewer_id><review_date>2013-03-06</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Having taken 4 very different courses so far, CS50x has been by far my favourite. The lectures go at a good pace and are very engaging, the problem sets are challenging while also encouraging creative solutions, and the final project is a fantastic method of bringing together everything you have learnt in the course. To address a few of the negatives raised by others: * I'm surprised at the difficulties in figuring out the VM and submitting the solutions. I am very far from an expert, but I found the step-by-step instructions provided more than adequate (a heck of a lot easier than keeping Rails running in CS169x at least) * It's true that the lecturer does go over things that would not be relevant to an online student (e.g. office hours, hackathons, etc), but these are usually only five minutes at the start of the lecture. Also, one of the beauties of taking an online course is that it's incredibly easy to fast-forward through irrelevant material, so I don't see how this is an issue The only possible negative point I'd raise with this course is the amount of noise on the discussion forum. I did initially try to do my part and help others with their questions, but the sheer volume of irrelevant posts and identical questions made this feel pointless. Overall though, I'd highly recommend this as a first online course for anyone interested in development or computer science.</review><course_id>34687</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Computer Science</course_title><reviewer_id>769</reviewer_id><review_date>2012-12-25</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>This course is fantastic, and I don't really think "a lack of online format transition" a problem at all. Many many other courses have been delivered in the form of a whole chunk before as well, such as courses on MIT open courseware and the previous "Justice" series, and they are still pretty amazing if you really can sedate yourself for just an hour and listen hard. Not to mention that in this course, except for the length of the course, every other thing that should be here is here, such as in-video questions, transcripts, online gradebooks, discussion forums and stuffs and stuffs. Sometimes I really wonder whether those pieces of videos in just over ten minutes can go into much depth, an example being Khan Academy's Linear Algebra, which I took and completed. The course content is of course amazingly enthralling as this is one of the best courses in Harvard. Actually getting to see how the whole class interacts is a benefit itself as there's much to learn. Just from seeing the whole class and listening to the teacher talk you can feel that "wow this is indeed Harvard"! Sometimes I just can't help laughing out load and I'm sure that all the time I'm indeed learning something. You can hardly ask for more. And IMO in which language it is delivered doesn't matter at all. It's the words of wisdom from the instructors, the stimulation from the intellectual atmosphere, and the comprehensive, reasonable course structure for an introductory CS course that matters the most!</review><course_id>34687</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Computer Science</course_title><reviewer_id>59825</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-11-09</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course has brought a lot of knowledge to me.

Both in terms of the quality of teaching, the production quality of lectures &amp; supporting materials and the fantastic content delivered with the sort of enthusiasm that draws you in and makes you want more. The CS50 sense of humor, CS50 live, outtakes etc try to bring a sense of the fun on-campus students clearly have with the course. Even with many years experience of programming I still found parts of the course challenging, and with no CS background I have learnt a lot. The self paced format however means this should be as accessible to someone completely new to the subject. If you don't get a concept from the lectures there are short videos explaining everything covered in the course, not to mention Reddit &amp; other discussion opportunities to discuss a problem with peers and staff. I really like the fact I got to watch full recorded lectures delivered on campus, I'm often bored when other courses record screen casts or read from a script  in front of their computers, but not here. The format let me take several other courses at the same time, which had strict deadlines, so it was great I could take a break from CS50 when required. The good: \- CS50 staff \- the content (the course really gives a great platform for a life, or even passing interest, in CS. \- full lectures, closest format to on campus I've seen \- self paced format over a whole year means you can fit in with your life and really take your time to get the most out of it. The bad: \- I'm quite annoyed at how bad my University courses were \- I really want to go to Harvard and experience the course in person \- Other MOOCs are now a disappointment</review><course_id>34687</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Computer Science</course_title><reviewer_id>30930</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-05-07</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>After this course I fell in love with Harvard. This was by far the greatest 6 months of my educational life I've ever had. Everything was so well planned out and explained nicely and pictorially to the students. The difficulty of the course kind of rises exponentially (don't let this statement of mine scare you though!!!), it starts off very easily, and then with each problem set it gets considerably more difficult but the knowledge that one gains through the lectures is considerably richer so it's a perfect compensation for the exponential rise of the complexity and difficulty. I honestly can't imagine more intuitive and more efficient way to learn basics of computer programming than simply finishing CS50 course completely. The amazing thing is that you get the HarvardX certificate for free with the authentication code written at the bottom. Thank you edX and thank you Harvard for allowing me to take this course, it's definitely one of the best choices I've ever made!</review><course_id>34687</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Computer Science</course_title><reviewer_id>7000</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-02-07</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I took the fall 2011 version of this course on the Harvard cs50.tv platform before it came to EdX. More recently I signed up for the EdX version out of interest to see what they had changed. This course is a general introduction to computer science focused primarily on the C language. Topics covered: bits, binary, ascii, Scratch, C, compilers, functions, types, scope, linear search, binary search, big O notation, sorting, pointers, data structures, HTTP, HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, JavaScript, Ajax and APIs. Unlike more other introductory courses, this class starts with C, a low level language, rather than a high level language like Python. It also covers several different languages instead of sticking with one language the entire time. The amount of content on the new EdX course is amazing and extremely helpful. They have short videos and tutorials summarizing all the most important topics of the class. This course covers a lot of ground and it takes a long time to get through everything, but it provides a comprehensive overview of computer science that gets a bit more low level than most other courses, which is a good thing.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>34687</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Computer Science</course_title><reviewer_id>42634</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-07-22</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Mind-blowing from the "This is CS50" sentence spoken by David J.

I doubt that anyone wanting to take this course is new to online learning. That's good because you're about to see something you've never seen before, a MOOC done right. The difference between this course and every other online course I've taken is night and day and it only takes 1 lecture to see that. An absolutely INSANE amount of effort has gone into the production of CS50. Yes it sucks and you get extremely jealous that you're not there for the real life fun but the content is all there. For free. The lectures are attended by students online too. There's a point towards the end where the lecturer shows how many of the campus enrolled students attended the lecture online. It's quite a few. Anyway, I studied computer science in college a long time ago. The content was exactly the same. However, the Teacher, David Malan is the most engaging lecturer you will ever come across. He also has a lecture on how he teaches his class elsewhere on edx, it's fascinating (don't watch it before the first lecture though!) It's important to remember that the MAJORITY of the learning and heavy lifting is done in the sections, not the lectures. If you think you'll learn everything you need to know by watching the 20 x 1 hour lectures, you're wrong. The content is very accessible. It's not easy, but it's accessible, even to beginners. Using C as the main language I thought was a great idea. It really doesn't get more difficult than C so if you can get through this course, you'll have an extremely easy time picking up other languages. Becoming a programmer doesn't happen in lectures. It happens as you hack your way through problems yourself. This course will give you a solid grounding in programming concepts for you to do that. If you finish this course, you can easily go off on your own and learn the rest. Might be worth noting that the course gets tough from week 6 to 8 but after that, it leaves C and gets much easier (and interesting). So don't worry that you think it's escalating out of control. It gets easier. Stick with it. Finally, the production values, problem sets (homework) and even the awesome music among many little touches really add up. Kudos to the production team. I took this course expecting another piece of crap lecture of a boring professor writing on a chalkboard and videos on an old Nokia cellphone. I'm now eating my hat. I work in software (on the business side). Trust me, if you want to get into the industry, this is without a doubt, the best place to start. All our non programmer new hires are now required to take this course.</review><course_id>34687</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Computer Science</course_title><reviewer_id>61396</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-12-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Having a somewhat weak background in Computer Science, I wanted to brush up on what I knew, and then some. And I definitely got what I was after. CS50 taught me not only a lot about C, including lower-level concepts such as hash tables, tries, and other data structures, memory management, but also about popular development languages like HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP and, most importantly, it taught me to go off on my on and learn by myself. In this sense, it taught me to teach myself new technologies, which is essential to the learning of CS/programming: you're just never done. Every new project is a new opportunity to learn and relearn a lot, each time going further. I was able to go from the basics to thinking up the details of my own web apps. It gives you enough ground to work on iOS, Android and desktop projects. And even if you have little interest in working with CS, it's a good course for everyone in this day and age of information technology: just about anyone can benefit from knowing more about the inner workings of a computer, what it can and cannot do, and how to deal with it properly. Overall, by far the best MOOC I've ever taken.</review><course_id>34687</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Computer Science</course_title><reviewer_id>61237</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-12-14</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I had no previous computer science or programming experience before course, but feel much more knowledgeable and confident now.

Coming into CS50x I knew a lot of basic Computer Science but a lot of what I knew in detail was out of date. My tl:dr review is that CS50x is an excellent introduction to Computer Science. Taking CS50 will: 1\. Help you develop useful programming skills in C, and to some extent in HTML, JavaScript, PHP and SQL. C has some terrible flaws but since it is still very widely used, and other widely-used languages such as C++ and C# are to some extent based on C, so it is a good choice of vehicle to learn the arts of programming and debugging. 2\. Introduce you to a number of key ideas which apply in any programming language, including algorithms and speed, pointers, iteration, and recursion. 3\. Introduce you to some fundamental data structures such as trees and linked lists. 4\. Set you programming exercises using real-world types of data used in graphics, cryptography, file compression, and web applications. Each problem set has a 'required' level and a 'hacker' level. The 'hacker' level doesn't get you any extra marks, but challenges you to work on a more advanced level if you want to stretch yourself. The whole thing is backed up by an excellent technical environment emulating Linux on a range of platforms and a friendly and supportive forum where students helped each other learn with some teaching assistant supervision. Finally, a word of caution. CS50x has a steep learning curve, especially towards the end when students get to build a real web application using a combination of tools. This steep curve is inevitable since a lot of material is covered to a worthwhile level, but, especially if you are new to the subject, don't expect to 'ace' every aspect of the course. In my view just reaching the level required for a certificate is a big achievement, and many students will benefit greatly without doing that.</review><course_id>34687</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Computer Science</course_title><reviewer_id>74419</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-05-01</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Ahhh David Malan, a wonderful professor in the new era of free education. CS50 is the ultimate example of what modern (and perfect) education is like, here are 5 reasons. (1) Many ways to learn: I cannot learn via lectures, I really can't. As much as I want to, because all courses are taught in lectures, I lose focus in lectures. CS50 provides you with lectures, manuscript, you can download these videos at any time, there are many 5-minute videos on the same topics as the lectures, tutorial videos (where TA walks through the assignments), links for reading, by looking up the topics on your own, etc. It lets YOU decide how YOU want to learn. The resources are there for YOU to decide which method you want to use. (2) Live Q&amp;A. What kind of professor and TAs give up their time to provide SO MUCH HELP for the 10,000 students online FOR FREE? The best kind. They are quick and responsive in emails and in forums. (3) CS50's goal is to arm students with the basics of programming such that TODAY, starting RIGHT NOW, you can pick up ANY computer language and master it. I mastered PHP thanks to this course. (4) the assignments are f*** challenging. Here's an example of an assignment: a disk with 50 photos is corrupted, can you recover this data? Believe it or not, I solved it on my own!! (5) Learn at your own pace: tying back to (1) all materials from previous years are online, you can learn quickly, you can learn slowly. This course is in your hands.

(Completely worth it.) This course is fun interesting exciting and hard. They work hard to be engaging and interesting. It tries to expose you to as many of the different areas of computer science as possible. Every week built on the past weeks but at the same time it felt like taking a class on a different subject ( Note: I mean this in a good way. ). The range of things covered and how well they where covered was mind boggling. They always provide you with all the things you need to succeed but they don't hold your hand and baby step you through everything. They expect you to take charge of your own learning to do your own research too be able understand how things connect and extrapolate from what they provide to the best courses of action. You will need to take charge and take responsibility for your own learning. In these ways the course provides you with training not just in cs but also in basic ability's you need to succeed in the world. Though at times it can fell frustrating and intimidating. I often felt like I might not make it but I now fell that I have learned more in this course than any other I have ever taken and am glad they have not dumbed it down or simplified it. In short if you like a challenge, want to learn about CS, and or want to push yourself to be the best you can be mentally this course is for you. If however you just want certifications and a beefer resume with as little time and effort as possible this course is not for you. ( Note: This is the highest I have ever rated a course. I have tried to be clear and honest about everything so ppl won't be surprised and put off by the difficulty's. But I cannot say enough about what a wonderful experience this course has been despite the difficulty's. Because looking back at the course and what I have taken away from it has shown me that it is far more than the sum of its parts. )</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>34687</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Computer Science</course_title><reviewer_id>66821</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-12-30</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>David J.

This class looks incredibly cool if you can take it in person. However, the edX version just doesn't translate well. The lectures and exercises are not in matching order with the course. This leads to problems when you get to problem set 3, as you will be doing the follow-through videos and the output you should get doesn't match what's on the screen. Other times you will be directed to download files for an assignment and they're not there. You're told everything from restart your appliance to just reinstalling it and "hoping" it works. This is not worth wasting the time on. I have an IT background, I know when and where my appliance has Internet connectivity. From reading the forums it seems as though the edX delivery order is NOT the same as the university's is, meaning we get the problem sets at a different point in the course as those attending in person. There are several times when this causes complete confusion if you're not already a "coder". CS50x claims it's for those with and without experience coding. You would think the online delivery would be better suited for that claim. I hate to stop the course after 4 weeks, but it just got too hard to follow in order, and deal with technical challenges of the CS50 appliance at the same time. Maybe I'll try again next year.</review><course_id>34687</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Computer Science</course_title><reviewer_id>72669</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-03-05</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Challenging enough to keep me motivated.

They use a Brazilian method. If you don't know anything about programming language - try to write more simple code first (use a youtube to find lessons)and then sign up for this course. Otherwise it maybe be very frustrating and repulsive experience that makes you never want to try coding again. Also - there is almost no support or consultations available. They will send you to forums for info. 2nd point: I have Master's and Bachelor's degree. There is a huge difference between full-time education and this online course. mainly it's quality.

This is a difficult class with emphasis and in detail teaching as well as practicing algorithms on C, a sturdy and conservative, not object-orientated, programming language. Later in class and in accordance with the evolution of programming languages, more object-oriented programming languages, building on C, are introduced: PHP, JS, and applied to web programming where one learns also HTML and CSS. Teachings by Prof. DJ Malan are flanked by a whole army of young teaching instructors that could go easily on themselves as full tenure professors on their subjects. The best about CS50x are the challenging problem sets that make one go over the excellent course material (lectures, shorts, sections, walkthroughs) many times until one really understands it and finds the clues to solve the problems. Solving those problem sets gives one a real feeling of satisfaction and may take a lot of days or even weeks per problem set. This was my first and till today my favorite MOOC. It took me around 8 weeks full-time to complete it (w/o cheating) and think that the $90 for the certificates is a bargain. I have done MIT’s CS courses on Python and Andrew Ng’s MOOC on machine learning and others as well, but feel gratitude towards Professor Malan’s CS50x for grounding me decently on this subject. Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like EDX has been able to cater for the life after CS50x. I am missing courses of the same intensity. I guess Berkeley’s „Artificial Intelligence“ or „An Analytics Edge“ from MIT, or Caltech’s „Learning from Data“ would have been decent courses to follow, but they have not been renewed so far. Missing those courses actually takes the edge out of EDX and to my understanding is just another example of scientific excellence being watered down by management decisions. At least CS50x continues...</review><course_id>34687</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Computer Science</course_title><reviewer_id>118188</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-02-04</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Amazing course.

I found the lectures well structured and the short instructional videos very helpful. I would highly recommend it but warn that the time needed to complete the exercises shouldn't be underestimated. The exercises were interesting but took longer that I had expected. I found little things held me up for an inordinate amount of time. In a class, this could have often been quickly overcome simply by asking a question but a lack of simple direct interaction with the instructors hampered me. There may have been ways around this but I didn't find them. Unfortunately, I had to drop the course due to external factors that required a lot of time and attention.

I understand that programming involves a lot of searching/googling to find out what to do, but if I am taking a CS course I want to learn some basic language stuff I will need to use in a Pset. I think sites like CodeAcademy need to be used in conjunction with this class, or classes that actually teach programming.

I code since 6 year old or so, but I've done it without understanding a thing - just copying game books into MSX to play them. There were no courses about it where I lived (in Brazil) as far as I recall. Still I learned a thing or two from this course, before dropping it in lesson 3 or 4. The content is good. David is also a great presenter, very academic, as you'd expect from some Harvardian. Don't expect the course to be for someone with no experience whatsoever. You'll probably be disappointed. The tools being used require some familiarity or a lot of free time to learn about them. Then again, learning about Computers do require a lot of will... You should learn how to learn by yourself, anyway. It is too much to absorb. Still, there could be much better ways... The school, however, imho, is doing almost everything wrong - just like most schools. It excels all of 'em just because it could charge a huge chunk of money and re-invest it, but... It's not even democratic yet, to begin with. And it's still charging way too much for most things. I also have a personal hurdle against academic field, who can't give me a single test and certificate my knowledge before going through all the bureaucracy of it, despite my knowledge, and so I get ostracized in the market. I could never bother to spend time learning whatever makes no sense to me, and I'm a huge student up to this date (34 now). And I'll always be. Yet, I'm no academic material, so... Yeah, that's my "small" rant against Harvard and academia in general.</review><course_id>34687</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Computer Science</course_title><reviewer_id>116548</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-12-08</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I took this course last year and this year and I enjoy it every time.

His ability to tie real-world topics to programming and computer science makes it possible for just about anyone to be successful in this course - assuming you have the time and will-power to complete it. The topics were broad enough to generate an understanding of how programming and computers can assist us in our daily lives, but also focused enough to allow the students to actually comprehend and retain the knowledge. Each Pset was challenging in one form or another, but all were possible due to the excellent lectures, walkthroughs, sections, and shorts.

There were many things I simply used and did not understand, that were explained as succinctly as possible. The videos and activities also helped to keep me engaged. However, I have to note that the course is quite difficult. For those with no prior experience, I am afraid some will face a steep learning curve. It was only manageable for me because I had prior knowledge of the subject.</review><course_id>34687</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Computer Science</course_title><reviewer_id>74660</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-05-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I actually found the course videos on Youtube and did 4 lessons before finding out that the course is run on edx. I had not done programming for a quarter of a century, but decided to take it up again. The instructor is terrific and the videos are very engaging. I also found a video of Mark Zuckerberg addressing a 2005 almost empty lecture theatre of a 2005 CS50X class, and it was fascinating to watch. This class is first class and must be just about the best introduction to computer science accessible on the web.

There are no science here! For example: lecture 7 theme - how internet works ? It seems the question of the child to his/her mother, but not for the CS theme. I apologize but we should call a spade a spade - it`s not science, it just some variation of "how stuff works".

That said, the course is definitely challenging. I spent about two weeks (holiday season) on the first five problem sets and learned a lot.

In taking these courses, one must have good math skills and basic college level chemistry. This course on transcription and transposition is the third of the sequence of four courses, and this course is just as exhilarating as the previous two courses. The course information is challenging, surprising and understandable. The instructors are excellent at communication. The diagrams, videos and slides crystallize all the course information and make the course information understandable, digestible, and memorable. Wow. I can’t say enough good things about this course.

This course is my first complete MOOC experience, and I am really proud of it. I am a teaching assistant of pathology in the Faculty of Medicine, Fayoum University, Egypt. I've known about Edx and Coursera for the first time during the past two years, and sadly I didn't realize at that time how great these two sites would be. However, a Facebook ad for Edx with the title 'Learn How to Code' appeared repeatedly enough to convince me think about MOOC study again and re-explore the edx.org website. This time was different. I don't completely understand why, but that is it. I can frankly say it, I regretted the missed time of my life away from you! This idea became a fact for me when I solved my first MITx 7.28.2x quiz. I realized that this is a different world from mine. :( The questions were really challenging, and solving them was a REAL success. The questions respected my mentality, and it was your THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING of the taught material that would bring you credit, not your memory! Although they were painfully difficult, the questions were just ENJOYABLE! I am desperately awaiting the repeated versions of MITx 7.28.1, 7.00, and 7.QBW *-I'll be happy if you told me they will be repeated-*and the yet unreleased version of MITx 7.28.3. I'll quote the words of one of MIT professors, Dr. Anthony J. Sinskey, which I heard in another MITx course '[I] found out there is a school called MIT, which I'd never heard of before, but I said, well these guys know what they're doing there, so I'll follow their curriculum.' I tested that myself! You know what you're doing, 7.28.2x staff. You made my past six weeks with you!

In Molecular Biology – Part 2 Quizzes you will explore more life lab (as started in the first part of this MOOC). Lectures, Test Yourself and quizzes will provide you with in-depth insight in assays, with a strong "big data" orientation.

This particular presentation is the second part of a molecular biology course, and dealt with transcription and translation (part 1 had to do with DNA replication and repair). As others have mentioned, the lecturers presented enough information to clearly elucidate the content, and the quizzes were masterfully done to make you really think as you worked through the problems. Professors Bell and Baker did a very good job of presenting the material. As a student, I have really enjoyed the not only the material being presented, but also the challenge of the quizzes. What I especially appreciate about the courses is that the technology has advanced to a stage that allows visualization (animation, some quite realistic!) of these processes, and that has added to the appeal of these courses. As a life sciences science major (I graduated with a Biochem degree in the '70s), I am in awe of what has been happening in the field, and especially grateful to the people who are teaching this material so clearly now.</review><course_id>47685</course_id><course_title>Molecular Biology – Part 2: Transcription and Transposition</course_title><reviewer_id>116697</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-12-14</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The content is awesome.

Prof. Chrostowski and his team did an incredible job of preparing the material... Highly recommended.' Indeed, '...Prof. Chrostowski is an awesome teacher...' Please allow me to offer a difference of opinion to the earlier suggestion that, '...the course is not recommended for somebody who does not have an engineering background...' I loved it! I didn't '...devote a few hours a day for quiet study every day...' yet I am still not disappointed... what a brilliant course!</review><course_id>45463</course_id><course_title>Silicon Photonics Design, Fabrication and Data Analysis</course_title><reviewer_id>112780</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-09-09</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I was a little hesitant about taking this course because I already had some experience in silicon photonics.

Lukas earlier to learn from him and his course. I am currently taking the course at eDX.org. The course is extremely helpful for me. If somebody would like to know essential things about Silicon Photonics, this course is a must. I just summarized what I remembered here and hope it is helpful for you. The course shows the whole process, from design to manufacture, of a passive silicon photonic device called Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The process starts from analyzing/simulating fundamental components such as silicon waveguide, Ybranch, and grating coupler with Matlab, Lumerical (MODE, INTERCONNECT). And then, you have chance to learn about how to layout your design using Klayout or Mentor Graphic and fabrication. You also have chance to learn about many variations which affect your final product such as resolution of the EBeam machine, processing time vs. precision, waveguide roughness .. Finally you will know how the measurement is automated/ how to work in team (design merge, design error checking), how the experimental result is fitted and surprisingly your results are somewhat predictable by using corner analysis. Your final results are expected to fall within the min-max range of your corner analysis. Happy with your course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>42213</course_id><course_title>Psychologie de la négociation</course_title><reviewer_id>116207</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Wow!

The selection of the material for the course truly gave a great insight and appreciation into the complexity of living organisms. Especially unique was the integration of the various assays into the material to give a laboratory perspective on how scientists know what they know. The editing on the videos was superb, keeping the focus on just what was essential for the lesson. All this alone would be enough for high praise, but the masterfully crafted problem sets, which genuinely contributed more to my understanding than even the wonderful lectures, by demanding reason and thought, even if at the expense of requiring quite a bit of time, set this course apart. I felt as if I was actually in the lab with Brian, Alice and Rajeev, all of whom, helped make this short journey memorable. Lastly, many thanks to all the contributors on the discussion boards. I am both appreciative and humbled by their considerable intellect, knowledge, astonishing response time, and their enthusiasm for sharing it with us. Magnificent!

This means it is not just random memorization of names and function of proteins. The lecturers' enthusiasm (and comments like "oh God, I know nothing about anatomy") make their lectures a joy to watch. At the end of this course you will know a great deal about how to set up experiments, how to interpret data, and the details (and what is still unkown) of the mechanisms through which cells replicate and repair their DNA.</review><course_id>46987</course_id><course_title>Molecular Biology - Part 1: DNA Replication and Repair</course_title><reviewer_id>75037</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-05-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is a class where the challenge sneaks up on you. Most of the lectures are delivered somewhat rapid-fire by Stephen Bell, who does a admirable job of describing the somewhat mind-blowing chemical machinery of DNA replication. You definitely must take careful notes. The first of the weekly quizzes is a rude awakening that the course will not be easy. There is a big emphasis in the quizzes on experimental design and analysis, requiring you to figure out assays/experiments to detect the phenomena being studied. But by the time you get through the quiz you are smarter, so that's a good incentive to take the challenge and continue through the 8 weeks and learn all about DNA replication and repair. You'll never feel the same going out in the sun again! There were some glitches in the edX platform involving the PyMol molecule viewer which hopefully should be ironed out next time.</review><course_id>46987</course_id><course_title>Molecular Biology - Part 1: DNA Replication and Repair</course_title><reviewer_id>74812</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-05-21</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I really enjoyed this course (I took biochemistry/molecular biology in 1982; things have changed a little...) from the clear, engaging and substantive lectures, the relevant and challenging quizzes and the extra tidbits (references to PDB files, papers to supplement the course).

I have no scientific background, but I'm interested in the future of medicine: understanding the circuitry of cells (DNA, replication, repair, transcription, epigenetics). Quite the challenge, as this is new stuff, far from mainstream. I loved the clear, engaging and substantive lectures, the relevant and challenging quizzes, and the outstanding pedagogy at work everywhere, especially in the deep dives videos. In this course you will learn a lot about assays, and quizzes always put the emphasis on data interpretation. You are in a real-life lab. Among others, you will work with Brian, your error-prone lab mate, and Alice, without whom your lab would be falling apart...

By that I mean that a good integration exists between lessons, two a week, each broken down into smaller segments, with very short "test yourself" questions following each segment. A weekly quiz probes not simply retention or memorization of biological facts, but the ability to be analytical with those facts in hypothetical research situations. Each lecture is short enough, always less than 10 minutes, so that the material doesn't become overwhelming in that respect. The weekly quizzes, covering all the lecture segments, are, however, quite challenging and demanding, as they require "working with" the lesson material analytically, not robotically. The instructors are both dynamic and extremely knowledgeable in this field, and the TAs seemed always ready to help with explanations. I would like to thank MIT for providing what, in my opinion, is an incredible course. Now on a personal side, frankly I did not pass this course with a 60%. I enrolled in it for "fun" because the material was so interesting, and because I took college biology many, many years ago, with just a short intro to biology course from Coursera recently, I did not have the "background" to even attempt being an ace student. Nevertheless, as something of a layperson, I did approach the material seriously, except when I randomly guessed at some segment or quiz questions because I didn't have a clue :) I watched all the lectures and took all the weekly quizzes except the week my internet service went down, which it did again the evening before the last quiz was due. I also posted a few questions in the forum, to guide my study. I would label this course as fairly rigorous or even intensive, but I think the rewards for taking it are immense, whether you enroll expecting to thoroughly master the material or enroll just trying to gain an educated layperson's perspective on our present state of knowlege about DNA replication and repair. While in some senses all I can say, because of my background, is that I was "exposed" to an incredible body of knowlege about the intricacies of DNA rather than truly mastering those intricacies through hypothetical application, the amount of fascinating information I've been exposed to is nothing short of mind boggling. For anyone, such as myself, with just a basic knowledge of DNA going into the course, I found it absolutely awe inspiring to learn just how much we now know about DNA replication and repair. The course will leave you in awe of the intricate machinery of our bodies (and those of E. coli), as well as give you a deep respect for the researchers who are busy bringing to light an ever increasing knowledge of DNA mechanisms. It will also give you an admiration for instructors who can explain this knowledge to others. Five stars certainly!</review><course_id>46987</course_id><course_title>Molecular Biology - Part 1: DNA Replication and Repair</course_title><reviewer_id>74970</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-05-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>If you are interested in learning some molecular biology, you can't go wrong taking this class. The instructors are masters of their craft and their support staff are superb. This class goes beyond the usual recitation and testing of comprehension. A portion of the weekly HW's/quizzes are designed to force you to think about how to use what you have learned to solve 'simulated real-world' problems. If that sounds like too much, please note that one can earn a certificate (for those who are obsessed with such things) without an excessive time commitment since the 'pass' level is only 60%. I'm just saying that if you want to dig in, the content is there for you to profitably invest more time in improving your capability to think.</review><course_id>46987</course_id><course_title>Molecular Biology - Part 1: DNA Replication and Repair</course_title><reviewer_id>113868</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-10-03</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>It was interesting to see how much progress molecular biology has made in the last ~15 years. The contents of this class are cutting-edge. The instructors and the designers of the educational materials have done an outstanding job here. The use of multimedia in the quizzes and exercise is extremely clever. It must have taken ages to program this on the EDx platform. You'll work with 3d interactive visualization tools to analyze molecular structures. You'll do thought (or real interactive) experiments on many, many different variants of "virtual gel electrophoresis". To do the exercises, I recommend to work on a recent PC with big screen(s). A laptop might suffice to watch the videos., though. I feel now that I can understand the life science articles in magazines such as Nature or Science much better.

The lectures are brief and exact and the concurrent quizzes are easy to get through (if you pay attention to the lecture). I found it was the weekly quizzes where you really earn your keep with this course (they account for about 90% of your score). These quizzes are extremely well designed and are intended to teach as much as test. My feeling is it the quizzes more than anything that assure that what you heard in the lectures will be retained. Especially useful also are lectures on assays, which are integrally coupled to the theoretic information being provide. You will be required to interpret results of assays in the quizzes, and this where the challenge is greatest. Plan to spend more than typical hours for similarly described MOOCs. I found I needed between 10 and 15 hours per week to get good quiz scores (90+ percent). Finally, Professors Bell and Baker are exceptional. Most of this course (.1x) is taught by Professor Bell. They also have co-authored an exceptionally good textbook (with other well recognized authors) titled Molecular Biology of the Gene (2013). I believe this is one of the best MOOCs available on genetic molecular biology. I finished this course in Sept 2015. The TAs where also very good and the discussion board was very active and highly responsive.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>47002</course_id><course_title>How to Write a Novel– Part 1: Plan &amp; Outline</course_title><reviewer_id>119202</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-03-09</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>This course was entirely successful in getting me to develop my ideas into a full scene-by-scene outline which I am now using to write the first draft of a novel. I am particularly thankful for the instruction on structure, detailing of major turning points in a classic three-act plot, and advice on creating and sticking to a writing plan. If you want to write a novel, but need to overcome creative inertia, this is a great place to do it. I will say that while I found most of the content very useful, the course was a little asymmetrical for my tastes. I would have preferred a week devoted to each act, rather than groupings of smaller, specialized topics in the second half of the course. It also would have been nice to get direct feedback from a TA on my outline, rather then rely on the required comments of peers, which more often then not seemed to be compliments made out of mere obligation and lacking in analytical advice.

The pace was very fast for the amount of material given, but worth it. It is expensive, and as shown on the first page of this section, we are told it is $295. This page was the first I saw and the amount I remembered. What a shock I had when my Visa statement arrived. I found the $295 was in US dollars, a significant amount greater than $295 Canadian.

It worked on an individual basis as well as offering any degree of group participation an individual might want, from none at al to complete immersion. The content, presentation and technology were always excellent. I am a published writer of non-fiction and did worry initially that I might be wasting my money, that the course would not tell me anything I did not already know. This was absolutely NOT the case. In every module there was thought-provoking, ground-breaking (for me) material that will have a huge impact on my fiction. I had intended to spend 4 hours or so a week on the course but it was so good and there was so much to learn that I ended up devoting twice as much time as I had planned. I will certainly sign up for Course 2 in the series.</review><course_id>47002</course_id><course_title>How to Write a Novel– Part 1: Plan &amp; Outline</course_title><reviewer_id>118823</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-02-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I will not hesitate to continue with the rest of this series.

The questions were truly thought provoking. The Prof was excellent and his teaching method incorporated both visual and audio techniques. It was not dry that's for sure! Actually, it was fun and I really did look forward to the course sections. I also read the required books and found that helped considerably. Law should be thought with the understanding of today's legal situations and I think that what the Professor did, while keeping a firm foot in the prescribed legal dogma that's taught in many law schools. CONCLUSION: I learned more the Prof. than I did in a whole semester of Contracts in law school.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>34617</course_id><course_title>Astrophysics: Exploring Exoplanets</course_title><reviewer_id>119750</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-03-24</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This series contains the pedagogically best made courses that either edx or coursera has to offer . Implementing pedagogical research , Paul Francis has achieved a masterwork of teaching his topic . The course design , with a semester being broken up into 4 courses and videos so short that your attention spam won't drop, ensures continuous learning and thus deep understanding . The optional "Mystery" does not only make these courses fantastic fun but is "learning by doing it" come to life . With his course design , Paul Francis has given a new meaning to the word learning . You never learn more than when you are living it . No mathematical skills beyond middle school or which couldn't be looked up are needed to take these courses , yet mathematics are cleverly used throughout every course to provide true understanding of the topics covered , which makes these courses the ideal entrance for anyone curious about the universe .</review><course_id>34617</course_id><course_title>Astrophysics: Exploring Exoplanets</course_title><reviewer_id>116441</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-12-06</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course took me to a great journey around the cosmos.

I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The course was very interesting and professionally delivered in a fun and entertaining way. I highly recommend this course to any novice interested in learning more about Marketing or people who are thinking of starting up a new business. For me, it helped me gain an important perspective about how I am going to proceed with my business ideas. The course offered a good level of content in only 6 weeks. It also added a bundle of optional reading that I will use to study further after the course. I believe the optional reading is not needed to pass the quizzes and gain the certificate. The tutors explain clearly all the principles and methodology needed to be successful. Regarding the initial questionnaire concerning possible engagement of study (was my intention to complete the course in the given 6 weeks?). In reflection, I was surprised by how I was able to change from the plan of completing the course in 6 weeks to sitting down and getting done in 3 days. Fortunately, I had a few days holiday and could enjoy some study time! The only complaint I have is that at present this is the only course offered on edX by the tutors. I am very interested to continue studying with them and learn more about this subject.

The organisers should have made the students work a bit more, e.g. looking for/analysing data over the internet, and as a result, students like me who love challenges would have had a feeling of pride to have completed the course, which I miss compared to other courses.</review><course_id>48818</course_id><course_title>Analyzing Global Trends for Business and Society</course_title><reviewer_id>117391</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-01-08</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The Course was excellent.

The course describes basic probability theory, how to use statistical data to calculate numerical values related to a life insurance scheme et cetera. This is my first course on edX, and if the rest are as good as this I will definitely continue taking courses here. Everything in this course (except some of the probability theory) were new for me. However, the course material is easily explained and there are plenty of exercises in different difficulties. Adam has done a great job with this course. Thanks a lot!</review><course_id>46947</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Actuarial Science</course_title><reviewer_id>118693</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-02-21</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Thanks Adam for a great course! Of the many MOOCs I’ve completed, your course is one of the best I have seen. The interviews with actuarial practitioners provide a window into some of the opportunities in the profession. In addition to the excellent lectures, your videos of solutions to the problems were extremely helpful, especially for learning to use Excel efficiently. The problems were well thought-out, and the final was an excellent review of the whole course. I would certainly recommend this MOOC to any mathematics undergraduate who is trying to figure out what to do after their BA. I could also envision university and colleges who do not offer courses in actuarial science contracting with ANU to use the materials in this course, with the help of a qualified local instructor, as the basis of a short introductory course. (The so-called upside down classroom is one in which the students watch lectures at home and get help in working on problems in class.) In fact, the content of this course is very useful for anyone who has to handle money, which is everyone! Even those of us with mathematical backgrounds may not necessarily know how to organize financial calculations. We retirees are always busy studying our cashflows, refinancing our houses, thinking about investments and annuities, sending streams of money to our feckless offspring, organizing our tax records, and generally doing frequent spreadsheet calculations. After taking your course, and especially after finishing the final, I feel prepared to tackle any financial calculation and produce a beautiful (and even correct) Excel spreadsheet.</review><course_id>46947</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Actuarial Science</course_title><reviewer_id>116993</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-12-22</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Well taught and in an excellent format of short interviews with an area specialist followed by a lecture from the specialist and then spreadsheet oriented exercises. For anyone thinking of the US exams, I think this is a better first step toward becoming an actuary than focusing on statistics &amp; probability for the first exam since this gives a better impression of what the professional environment and processes might be like.</review><course_id>46947</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Actuarial Science</course_title><reviewer_id>116683</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-12-14</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>It is a wonderful course. The course is structured in an engaging way. The part I liked especially is on modelling and simulating different insurance scenarios. It also imparted knowledge of dealing with uncertain cash flows. The interviews with people from industry folks added more information and gave an overview as what they do exactly on job. The instructor was kind enough and patient in clarifying the doubts. Overall, it is a great course to begin with, if you are looking forward to tread in actuarial path. If you are already in the actuarial sector, this would be a great refresher.</review><course_id>46947</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Actuarial Science</course_title><reviewer_id>116582</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-12-09</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course was a great introduction to actuarial science.

The lectures are well done, and the assignments flow logically from them. The course uses Excel and the instructor helps with demos of how to use it. The course material is not simply rote learning; students are asked to apply what they are learning in interesting applications. I hope that the course will have a follow-on to more advanced topics. I have now taken six EdX courses and I would rank this among the best I have done.</review><course_id>46947</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Actuarial Science</course_title><reviewer_id>116082</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course does what it promises: it provides a very good introduction to actuarial studies. The instructors have put a lot of effort in providing a full set of learning material; everything is downloadable -videos, subtitles, written courses, example Excel solutions, and even detailed explanations to assessment questions. I disagree with the reviewer who said that there were no practical examples; maybe this person did not follow the lessons long enough. And it is Actuarial Science, so the fact that there is a lot of Mathematics involved should not come as a surprised to anyone. An example of the amount of thought that has gone into this course is that the timing of the assignments is given in Coordinated Universal Time. A clock set to this time zone can be seen ticking away in all the relevant pages, so that nobody can miss a deadline because of time differences. I have completed several MOOCs at EdX and other platforms, and this one stands out very positively. Students are constantly encouraged to take part in the discussions and the enthusiastic staff answers any question almost immediately. Unfortunately EdX' discussion interface is not very user friendly, to put it mildly, so I find myself avoiding using it.</review><course_id>46947</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Actuarial Science</course_title><reviewer_id>115606</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-15</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>great introduction to this specialized field, every day there are new challenges where as a student you are put in a situation to learn and apply the lessons wth practical exercises.

The statistics and probability math is very practical and the DMAIC concept is a great structured process for quality control. I think there are a few downsides or problem areas, however. The course was too easy and probably a bit too short (if it's too easy, I'm probably not learning). The lectures were very informative, though the cookie example for the DMAIC/six-sigma real-life example was too dry. I would have liked to see more homework and practice problems. Also, most of the problems were straightforward and simple, so I didn't think it was challenging enough.</review><course_id>45226</course_id><course_title>Quality Engineering and Management: Fundamentals of Six-Sigma</course_title><reviewer_id>112840</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-09-11</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course is a must for all quality professionals.

This EdX course was fascinating, and one of the best I have taken. The professor is lively and engaging, and material fascinating.

It is a really good introduction to the amazing world of Linux. Everything is in bite size chunks which means that it is easy to study when you have time. It took me around three months of part time study to complete. The final exam was either easier than I expected, either that or I had taken in the course material better than I realized. I was pleased to get 100% and a verified certificate.

This course has given me some great insight , yet i was a bit disappointed at lengthy interviews which were mere speculation and even proposed senseless theories which as discussed on the forum did not even offer a possible solution to the problem at hand. The course could do with a bit of improvement at that front to match the three previous excellent courses .

I really enjoyed all four courses. The way they are presented is engaging; the content is presented on a projection screen and the two lecturers stand in front and discuss the content. There are also some videos are of laboratory visits and guest interviews. The friendly exchanges between the two lecturers appears genuine and adds another layer of interest. One of the most rewarding outcomes from doing these courses occurred when I attended a public lecture about the Giant Magellan Telescope. I could understand everything the speaker was saying - this was really satisfying! I am glad I did these courses as I feel I now have a solid basis for understanding the exciting events that are likely to occur in the future.

If you are new to DSP, this course will allow you to apply what you learn to practical applications right away. The course will also give you a strong foundation for more advanced DSP subjects. If you are already familiar with DSP as in my case, the course will be a great refresher and you'll likely learn new ways of analyzing systems and dive deep down on concepts that you might have forgotten.

The educational approach is excellent with theory directly followed by review questions, hands-on practice on a variety of problems and a variety of databases and a graded quiz. Equally well I think worked the request to submit a proposal of research which made me think (very thoroughly) about output variables, counterfactuals and controls, data sources and possible methods of analyses. Despite I am new to the R programming environment, I had no difficulty following the course and I am now more than sure I will work with R in the immediate future.

The video lectures were clear and easy to follow. All of the materials for the week are presented at once, which allows me to follow along and take notes. I also was unfamiliar with R, but very familiar with Stata; learning to use R was very intuitive for me because of Stata's coding language. Also, the instructor's notes within the code helps to explain the commands without him having to address each in-depth. The TA was fantastic. She and the instructor participated in the discussions, offering additional reading materials and responding to questions in a very prompt manner. All in all, the course was great. I learned a lot from the materials. It took me about 4-5 hours per week--I am a native English-speaker and familiar with statistics and statistical software, though not RD/ITS specifically. The course content was new information to me. The thing you have to get used to is the time differences and keeping track of due dates based on UTC time. The instructors made assignments due after the weekend, which is helpful to those of us who work full-time. Also, do not expect to have a fully executable study at the end of the course. The feedback is somewhat helpful, but this course is not designed to be a place for you to practice your own research.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>48827</course_id><course_title>The Art of Structural Engineering: Bridges</course_title><reviewer_id>120061</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-04-04</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>it's really interessting , I didnt get the chance to start it from the bigenning but I hope you'll make it again in the future .</review><course_id>48827</course_id><course_title>The Art of Structural Engineering: Bridges</course_title><reviewer_id>119160</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-03-07</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>More detail analysis for structures is felt missing in contents.

I remember college from 10 years ago. there is NO reason one class has to have 50 people when, now in digital age we can have 50 million or 500 million people. now has come for a time where billions of people, all 7 billion, can have free access to world -class university. from a class of 100, we can now have a class for 3-7 billion people. this class is great, I learned a great deal about all people of the world.</review><course_id>34509</course_id><course_title>Anthropology of Current World Issues</course_title><reviewer_id>57325</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-10-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This has been an excellent course, a great way to be introduced to anthropology. The course is well organized, interesting, the marking system is fair and free of any technical glitches that plague some courses. The technical side has been superbly handled (like other Queensland course I've taken) and the instructors have been great. I strongly recommend this course if you would like to learn something about anthropology and the world.

Gerhard Hoffstaedter is a lively and enthusiastic presenter, with clear knowledge of the theme. He has the right amount of passion for the subject and clear perception to guide other presenters into a meaningful presentation. However, unlike other MOCCS I took, this course was unable to present a theory of antropological relationships and back them up with experiment and design and event data. Further, the examples provided were few and were mainly based upon other teacher's concepts. The fact that I scored 100% right answers on all tests did not prove how well I grasped any course learning, but rather my copy and paste hability in capturing the asked question and then looking for the same words within the provided video transcript. My own practical theory is that if I can just find an answer by copy and paste mechanism, I am not learning anything at all. Worst part of all was filling lectures with interviews from other professors, who in turn would just provide their own definition of a subject. These professors may well be experts in their own very fields, and as ignorant to the subject I cannot tell they are wrong. But without a model or data from actual happenings, their opinions are just as good as mine. There were very few actual events used to present cases. And a number of different resources that could have outlived speakers that have little hability in presenting their points. I found the course a waste of time, offering little to no chance of improving my knowledge. The fact that Anthropology may not be exact science, but rather a social science, should not prevent teachers to offer hard data evidence and make test interpretation part of the answer by building a model. This course needs complete re-writing. Teachers have good intention, but results are poor.</review><course_id>34509</course_id><course_title>Anthropology of Current World Issues</course_title><reviewer_id>120049</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-04-03</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course content is rich and engaging and helps the learner to think critically about issues.

In line with that, I would suggest to the instructors and providers to work on adding supplementary courses to this one and expanding the geographical reach to include the work of anthropologists in many other countries. This course enthused me to learn more about this subject and current trends. The only concern was that the quizzes were rather easy to do. Still, for a subjective perspective, the many maps came in handy and helped me to understand the views of students across the world on the topic we are handling every week.

An obvious nonsense as to begin with the frequencies are all wrong and amplifiers cooled with liquid helium are required. It is quite obvious he is an active part of the global elites dumbing down process and does not tolerate dissenting students. When the worlds universities have descended to this level there is little chance of anyone receiving a good science education.

I think this course was conceived at Harvard as a way of pressing some scientific concepts into non-scientists who don't cook much. The catch is that many of the people taking the MOOC version are keen home cooks with a science background, hoping to apply more science to their cooking. So the material splits into four parts: 1) Amazing videos from a range of professional chefs, and America's Test Kitchen, about preparing specific foods. Some are instructive, some fascinating, some bizarre; every single one is worth watching. The sous vide egg video is worth enrolling for this course alone. 2) Scientific exposition explaining in some detail what the course designers think is going on in the cooking, and introducing an 'equation of the week'. Some of this is good (Harold Magee's audio spots are consistently interesting), some rather dull, and, unfortunately, some is are simplistic or misunderstands the cooking techniques being demonstrated. 3) Homework exercises -- mostly very simple arithmetic exercises in dimensional analysis, made harder by using imperial volume measurements instead of SI units. These also have numerous errors, though some of the bugs have been worked out over time. 4) Labs -- where a simple cooking task is undertaken in a scientific fashion. The cooking bit of this has been quite interesting; some of the labs have been better designed than others, but mostly they've illuminated the topic under discussion. On the other hand, writing the 'lab report', self- scoring it against a hidden rubric, re-writing to cover the items in the hidden rubric, and resubmitting, is just plain tedious. Overall, it's worth doing if you're interested, but this is the first course I've done where I think the 'audit' option is likely to be the one to go for for most people. Will it improve my cooking? Maybe; I think knowing the equations for dispersal of marinade and thickening of sauces and emulsions might, yes.</review><course_id>36403</course_id><course_title>Science &amp; Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science</course_title><reviewer_id>118462</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-02-14</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course is great both in the culinary and in the scientific content. Great chefs present the various topics, with a final formal presentation of the physics that makes it possible. The course assignments require you to make culinary experiments and collect data. The main topics are heat transfer, diffusion, emulsion, gelification, Maillard reactions and fermentation. You will get better at cooking without feeling like a witch doctor anymore! It was unexpected and very effective how the only basic knowledge about Maillard reactions could improve even the most simple recipe.. my amatriciana sauce pasta will never be the same :)</review><course_id>36403</course_id><course_title>Science &amp; Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science</course_title><reviewer_id>116090</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-25</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>I found this course very disappointing: Very thin, handwaving, half-explained content wrapped into a flashy, breathless firework of packaging. I have a science background and always wanted to understand why in a cooking recipe you are asked to do one thing and not another, which instructions are crucial to the recipe working, which allow some flexibility and which are just there because of dear habits, but without function. I'd like to understand what substitutes can be used to replace missing ingredients, etc. So the course seemed just what I needed. What I found out is that this is a course which tries to hammer into science-averse people that "science is fun, and look here, you only have to bear with me for one equation per week, and I try to make it as painless as possible and give you cool music and flashy celebrity cook shows as a compensation for being so patient (I know equations suck, but look, it's already gone again and there is the cool music)"... To someone actually interested in science, this attitude really bothers, but I wonder if it even has the opposite effect as desired to teach people without any predisposition towards or against science that science is something to be barely tolerated rather than embraced. And it teaches people that they don't understand science, since in this attempt to be apologetic about facts and equations and to keep the exposure "tolerably" low and easy, the explanations are so shallow and handwaving that they leave you with more questions than answers and no real understanding. Similarly, I was disappointed at the cooking videos: They seem mostly a chance for celebrity chefs to show off their style and give a great show with cool music and fast (almost hectic) cuts, but glossed over details and explanations in a way that I could often not follow what the essence of the recipe is or how to produce a similar effect in my own cooking. So, in summary, this course had great potential, but wasted most of it by providing a shiny shell that just shatters into lots of little pieces of glitter and nothing else when you actually try looking for some real content...</review><course_id>36403</course_id><course_title>Science &amp; Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science</course_title><reviewer_id>71940</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-03-01</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>SPU27x is the best course I've ever taken, both online and in person.

The instructors were engaging as well and I found much of the chemistry interesting. I also found the approach to self-grading of non-numeric questions against a detailed rubric a rather sensible approach. A lot of online classes tie themselves in knots with peer-grading that doesn't add a lot of value but annoys and even angers a lot of people. One could question re-submitting for a better grade against the answer which you've now seen but I view it as this course providing grades and a certificate as motivating factors while not taking them too seriously. So why not five stars? I guess because I ultimately wanted to like and get involved with the class more than I actually did. This isn't so much a science and cooking class as it is a sort of applied chemistry class against the background of cooking in general and modernist cuisine in particular. That's not necessarily a failing but some of the topics were taught better than others. And, in any case, expect lots of number crunching involving moles, dimensional analysis, and very large and small numbers. I found most of this straightforward enough, if often a bit tedious, but I can see it being very challenging for folks not comfortable with solving equations, working with exponents, and working with various types of dimensions. In general, I find the less math-heavy "science of cooking" as communicated by folks like Cooks Illustrated more interesting and more practical than the equation-heavy approach taken here. (As another reviewer noted--and I agree--I think the issue here is that this is effectively a Harvard undergrad chemistry course for non-science majors (?) and the approach to the material reflects that. If one were to design a Science and Cooking class for adults interested in cooking from scratch, I suspect you'd take a more conceptual approach even if the broad topics were the same.)</review><course_id>36403</course_id><course_title>Science &amp; Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science</course_title><reviewer_id>7029</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-02-13</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>This course makes one think while cooking. What size should the meatball be ? How long do I cook the steak ? Which ingredient should I add first and next when baking a cake ? How do I avoid soggy coleslaw ?

I like this course because it sharpens my mind and I enjoy watching the videos of the tops chefs in action (especially Joan Roca, Dan Souza and Joanne Chang). You will have a good of grasp of Maths, Physics and Chemistry before you could do the calculations in each assignment. Be prepared to invest time to complete the course, it is worth it.

All the examples are carefully built on previous ones and the R tutorials are clear and simple. Dr Mahometa and team have done an exceptional work with this course. The topics covered are: Introduction to Data, Univariate Descriptive Statistics, Bivariate Distributions (Numerical and Categorical Data), Linear Functions,and Exponential and Logistic Function Models. That's in 6 weeks with more or less 5 hours of work per week.</review><course_id>48830</course_id><course_title>Foundations of Data Analysis - Part 1: Statistics Using R</course_title><reviewer_id>119366</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-03-15</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The best course teaching R that I've found by now. The R programming course provided by JHU on Coursera is kind of too difficult for a beginner in R. But this course provided by UT is highly practical, easy and very funny to learn. The R tutorial is very helpful and we can have great chances to directly apply what we've learned from the video lectures to the Pre-lab, Lab and problem sets. I love UT-Austin!! Many thanks to all the great teachers from UT</review><course_id>48830</course_id><course_title>Foundations of Data Analysis - Part 1: Statistics Using R</course_title><reviewer_id>119297</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-03-12</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Well structured, weekly live (and archived) office hours and excellent content. Topics are covered in short, but focused videos. Hands on homework include "check your understanding" quizs, and pre lab and lab assignments. Seperate weekly videos include using R and RStudio to complete projects. All data sets are furnished and are interesting examples of real world data. This course requires students' strong time commitment, but is worth it.</review><course_id>48830</course_id><course_title>Foundations of Data Analysis - Part 1: Statistics Using R</course_title><reviewer_id>119277</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-03-11</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The best introductory course for statistical use of R!!!

I registered to learn how to use R and to refresh/learn basic statistics or at the leas when and why use which approach. So far this course has fully met my expectations, it is very well done, very interesting and tutorials are terrific. The reading part is also well done and contains numerous examples to train oneself. The Pre-Lab, Lab and Problem sets are also really good into evaluating how we perform. It's also possible to go a bit more into depth using optional readings. I'm glad I registered for the second course.</review><course_id>48830</course_id><course_title>Foundations of Data Analysis - Part 1: Statistics Using R</course_title><reviewer_id>119152</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-03-07</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>Curso de estadística básica con algo de R muy introductorio.

Eso si, el profesor explica muy bien y los videos de R son claros. Los examenes, lab y problem sets, solo tienen un intento. Lo voy a terminar pero no hare la segunda parte.

The course is very thorough in the way it introduces the concepts of hypersonic flight and scramjet vehicles step by step, building upon each section in order to achieve its objective: the project (simplified, of course) of a scramjet engine in all its components. This allows the student to grasp the behavior of the flow fields at each component of a scramjet and see the bigger picture of the entire engine. The course was definitely well structured, with no hesitation to develop pertinent equations and analyzing its components, showing well the physical implications of the mathematical formulation. I certainly recommend this course to anyone in the field and also to anyone who is interested in hypersonics, but without prior experience.</review><course_id>35931</course_id><course_title>Hypersonics – from Shock Waves to Scramjets</course_title><reviewer_id>42713</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-07-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Fantastic course.

Professor Morgan kept me on my toes with some note taking, and even so still had some difficulties in certain sections. I still loved the course regardless. A lot fun! I personally used a spread sheet to keep track of, especially near the end, the more long winded aspects of computations, or if you have it some favorite math software handy as a computational aid, preferably something that can be used for sequential computations (especially where if having to change parameters at the outset, this wouldn't leave with you with the same set of work in reformulating answers. Final project had an interconnected series of computations, over 50+ steps, but generally straight forward in terms of problem solving.

Yesterday I received my verified certificate. It means a lot. Passing the course is a personal milestone and a new positive motivation in my life-long goal to make uplifting comics of my superheroes, despite a series of physical and cognitive hurdles. If I’d have known as a kid I’d go from C and D grades because of a learning disability, to one day passing a course by Professor Michael Uslan with Stan Lee, -who told me that he expects “Great things” from me- I’d have been over the moon! The questions and guidelines of the course helped me further define and distill the multi story arc for my character, Ammon Walker, down to its essence in a few paragraphs. That had been a longtime challenge. Completing the course showed me I can express the concept of Ammon clearly and concisely. It also prepared me for an interview about origin stories on NPR Seattle, talking about Ammon, as well as other superheroes and their beloved creators. Because it was such a positive experience, I’ve recommended the course to others as well.

Some of the examples were quite difficult difficult and intensive, but they provide a good insight into the world of applied mathematics.</review><course_id>67548</course_id><course_title>Pre-University Calculus</course_title><reviewer_id>113779</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-09-30</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>i found the course very useful.it helps in many ways particularly prior entering university education besides also to develop mathematical thinking and logical reasoning. I am sure you wd also conduct elementary algebra,arithmetic,geometry,menstruation,integration differentiation etc.i found the video instruction very useful.

I learned so much! The material is very well explained, with PDF study guides and lots lots lots of exercises to practice, with inmediate feedback to see if you are right or wrong. The content is introduced with a real-life application for what you will be learning, and several exercises are real-life situations and applied concepts. I intend to take this course again to learn even more! :) Thanks to everyone in Edx and TUDelf!</review><course_id>67548</course_id><course_title>Pre-University Calculus</course_title><reviewer_id>113788</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-10-01</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>The strong point of this course were the staff and the community T.A's who answered a lot of questions related to the exercises. I completed this course in about 15 days and it was tough as I wanted to complete it before the deadline, as a matter of principle. In the end I made it by a hair's breadth. The course has a lot of practice material and the training modules were specially useful for gaining further conceptual clarity and the deal with tricky question. A problem I faced was being unable to understand what the question was asking for which led to quite a view wrong answers. I would recommend this to people who want a refresher in Pre-calculus, but if you did not take mathematics in High school then go with a course that goes more into detail.</review><course_id>67548</course_id><course_title>Pre-University Calculus</course_title><reviewer_id>113783</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-10-01</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I love this course but did not have time to take part.

Everything is really superficial. It can be accomplishment in 1 or 2 days without much effort. It is a tiring course if you already know something of another programming languages. The data science part teaches just how to import 3 packages and use the most simple commands. You can learn the same and much more just seeing the oficial documentation of the packages or do a Google search for tutorials.

The browser-based tool was quite constricting. I had hoped this course would let me build on two earlier Python courses, but now I feel that I wasted my time. (Went all the way through just to make sure it didn't get better.) Instructor seems like a nice fellow, though he talks with his hands (as my mother would say), but if the provider was Microsoft, it did not improve my opinion. If the provider was the other company, I can't imagine I'd go or recommend them for training, though they might be better in a less structured context, or with better tools than EdX provided. Sorry, I wish I could be kinder in my review, but I really feel like I was misled... The "Data Science" part of the course title probably shouldn't even be there.

But in general is great, and while you complement it with at least with a course of basic python (or you already knows python -not my case-) it is perfect.</review><course_id>51345</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Python for Data Science</course_title><reviewer_id>118121</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-02-02</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Completed this great course.

It is a good intro to this topic and I would like to have more advanced courses. Having said that there were some issues with the results parser on the Datacamp site that were not optimal. I was flagged for errors when there was no error in the code.</review><course_id>51345</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Python for Data Science</course_title><reviewer_id>118113</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-02-02</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>This is an excellent course that gets one started with numpy, matplotlib and pandas. It's really what I was looking for. Unfortunately it's quite short and easy. I would love to have more material covered and more challenging exercises.

No nonsense, straight forward, clearly spoke. The material does not try to be hard just precise and it achieves that goal. Learning doesn't have to be hard to be effective. The programming tool is great. If you want to make it harder just read certain parts and try to find the solution and go back and read on if you are having trouble.</review><course_id>51345</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Python for Data Science</course_title><reviewer_id>118110</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-02-02</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Very nice learning experience, very excellent interactive practice page.

I could have skipped the Python basics and done more with the actual data science, but maybe the basics are helpful to some. If anything, I'd have made the assignments harder and/or more involved. My initial impression on signing up for the course was that it would be more of a introduction to the data science libraries, not so much Python itself. Oh well. I'll definitely be able to use what I've learned in my career. Filip presented the material in a very clear way. I liked his style and contrary to what some have written, had no problem with his accent. Compared with instructors in some other courses, he's far ahead of most of them in his ability to present the information. I'm familiar with the edX format, so that works for me as well.</review><course_id>51345</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Python for Data Science</course_title><reviewer_id>118107</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-02-02</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>The course is good, but the presenter is a bit hard to understand, the code questions don’t accept all correct answers.

Good for users that want to get VERY basic view of python. Also, the exercises are way too basic. All you had to do was complete the code with 1 or 2 lines.

I love data science and found python as one of the most well equipped data analysis tools. There were no interesting courses available online that taught data science through python until this course came along. I however would have liked a longer course.

En ese sentido, ya hemos tenido varias experiencias publico- privada consideradas exitosas, pero aun existen varias necesidades que requieren reforzar nuestros conocimientos y fortalecer nuestra capacidad de gestión para concretar proyectos que generen el desarrollo social y económico de la localidad. En ese marco, los instructores, por las experiencias que poseen los mismos, podrán guiarnos de manera efectiva, a llevar a la practica los conceptos y las herramientas que serán proporcionados en este curso.

There is a function with which you can ask for their accuracy to the instructor, but there has been no feedback for them so far, and it has been three weeks now. The worst part is that your peers grade your work, and the basis of the grading can be wrong. The English levels of the participants greatly vary, so if you are on a better end of the spectrum, you will end up editing people's work and not getting anything in return other than “very good,” or worse, wrong feedback.

It gives an overall view of how to use this Microsoft's tool. You may also found some useful tricks when working with data. I only wish that assignments were different.

The course divides content into two tracks, an R track and a Python track, so you can complete the course with either language, but you'll need to know the basics of at least one of the two. Grading is based on 5 weekly reviews and a single 20 question exam. The course title "Data Science and Machine Learning Essentials" is misleading because this course is not really about data science or machine learning per se. The first week attempts to cram an entire machine learning course or two worth of concepts into a handful of mediocre lectures, while the remainder of the course is all about Azure ML. Weeks 2-5 provide a nice overview of Azure ML and the fact that it has full lectures for both R and Python is a great feature that surely took a lot of extra time and effort to produce. The main lecturer's presentation skills aren't the best, but the videos are still easy to follow. Azure ML offers a lot of interesting functionality, like the ability to use Python and R scrips in the same project and publish projects as web services, but some of the exercises were tedious and ran slowly. If data "Data Science and Machine Learning Essentials" were renamed "Intro to Azure ML" and only included the content in weeks 2-5, it would be a good course. Weeks 2-5 are definitely worth checking out if you are interested in Azure ML. As it stands now, however, the first week bombards students with far too many concepts explained too quickly to foster real understanding and sets the wrong expectations for the remainder of the course. I give Data Science and Machine Learning Essentials 2.75 out of 5: mediocre.</review><course_id>47036</course_id><course_title>Data Science and Machine Learning Essentials</course_title><reviewer_id>114626</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-10-22</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>The course title should be change to Azureml practice or something like that Only the first module give some explanation about data science but it is very short and shallow the rest of the course is a guide to AzureMl (which seem to be a useful and easy to work with, software) If you know data science and ML you don't need this course- just play a little bit with the software and you will understated how it works If you new to this filed (like I am) you will have to take another course for the basics</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>47036</course_id><course_title>Data Science and Machine Learning Essentials</course_title><reviewer_id>114608</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-10-22</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>The Content and the structure of the course is ridiculous.

That's not necessarily a bad thing. Azure ML is a DS tool and lowers the barrier-to-entry for people who want to get into the field and I think that's who the series is really targeted to. It really should be listed on a Microsoft community, not really on an edX, but that's fine. Both instructors are world-class in the field and would like to see more courses from each of them. If you're completely new to data science it's great exposure to a tool for use and I recommend it.</review><course_id>47036</course_id><course_title>Data Science and Machine Learning Essentials</course_title><reviewer_id>115794</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-18</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>A very good introduction to Azure ML.

And for that it's excellent - about the right level of detail and breadth for a 5-week course. It isn't an introduction to machine learning or data science overall (apart from some lectures in the first week that introduce concepts like supervised vs unsupervised learning, data science pipelines, etc.), and it isn't expert-level. It's a 5-week practical intro to Azure ML. Some of the comments about Dr. Elston's presentation are too harsh. He's a practitioner, obviously a highly adept one, more than a teacher, and that's fine. He does a good job and if you need to replay the video a few times now and then (I did), it's not a big problem. For variety, it would've been good if they'd alternated some of the classes. Overall, definitely worth taking if you want to get up to speed on Azure ML. If you want to learn about DS/ML in general or in any depth, there are better courses for that.</review><course_id>47036</course_id><course_title>Data Science and Machine Learning Essentials</course_title><reviewer_id>115790</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course is a good introduction to both the theory and practice of machine learning using Azure Machine Learning as of October 2015. The lectures and slides are as good as any other material currently out there: I rated the content a "5" fully aware that many students reported needing to study 2 or 3 times longer than the 3-4 weeks (and more study beyond this course is recommended before starting a major data science investigation). The ability to earn a certificate provides an opportunity to test learning against some criteria standards which are at a reasonable level to earn a "pass" (even though some of the class members including myself had some issues on the wording or available answers in these objective certificate questions). Please also look at Microsoft Virtual Academy, and separately Microsoft's Channel9 for any updates to Azure ML and Cortana Analytics.

C#, sql etc and have worked in reporting and anlytics. I did not have any experience in python, R, ML, statistics or data science. I found the course useful introduction to machine learning. It does not assume that you know either. In case where you might need skill in either, the knowledge is provided prior or the necessary code is provided. e.g. if you need theory about ML and python code. The ML theory part is covered in the course and the python code is provided. There is an assumption of basic stat knowledge. i did strugglee a bit with it though.

You will not be competent at data science after taking this course, but you will know how to use Azure ML, and you will have a very good idea of what data science is about.

However, the lectures could have been much improved. For example, it often felt as if Dr. Elston wasn't very prepared and was thinking on the spot. Numerous times he would be making mistakes and correcting himself, or spending time looking for examples in the data. Seriously, this course could have been better if the main presenter had been more prepared and familiar with his own examples. Another thing that could be improved: Dr. Elston will often talk you through his parameter settings – in the sense of which parameters he did chose, but not why! I am not sure what value is added by this. In any case, I would have liked to get more information about the reasons for choosing the parameter settings.</review><course_id>47036</course_id><course_title>Data Science and Machine Learning Essentials</course_title><reviewer_id>114880</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-10-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Some of the early reviews were written before all of the modules were even available. I'm writing this after completing the entire course &amp; the final exam. This course will not turn the layman into a Data Scientist. It introduces the layman to the concepts used in Data Science. Data cleansing, reporting, some basic statistics and the tools of R, Python and Azure ML. It uses some interesting real world examples to do it, that make following along relatively easy. As someone who's spent a lot of time working with Data as a DBA and Analyst, this course was enlightening. It would have been easier with some R/Python experience and better experience in statistics, but as-is, was very do-able. I wish I was better versed in data science earlier in my career, many of these principals would have been very useful (however, harder to deploy without things like Azure ML). I have done a lot of things the hard way because I was ignorant of these tools.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45487</course_id><course_title>Knowledge Management and Big Data in Business</course_title><reviewer_id>114199</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-10-11</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>This course is targeted at the right level for both undergraduate and post graduate business students.

The course lacks structure and clear vision of its goals. After, watching several videos, I still could not really come up with an intuitive big picture understanding of knowledge management. Ironically, the slides are the worst slides I've ever seen. They are often quite messy and just confusing. It's like the slides are actively trying to make you lose focus and interest. The professor was OK I guess, but he just kept talking and talking without actually saying anything. This mainly a consequence of the lack of direction and purpose in the lectures. While the topic is somewhat interesting, I don't want to spend time and effort on a course that could not even explain the big picture clearly. Based on the first week's lectures, I do not recommend this course.</review><course_id>45487</course_id><course_title>Knowledge Management and Big Data in Business</course_title><reviewer_id>111177</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-08-08</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>I thing that the course improve my knowleges and skills about management,and help me to learn new thing to start my new business</review><course_id>45487</course_id><course_title>Knowledge Management and Big Data in Business</course_title><reviewer_id>120150</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-04-07</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>The course is very informative.

I needed a highly relatable, non-technical course that would give me the fundamentals, highlight latest developments, realistic challenges in implementation and real live examples. I felt too guilty taking the course for free as I learnt a fair bit, hence I paid my fee in appreciation! For a busy professional, not able to pour in massive homework time, I was grateful it was mere quiz-based and focused more on imparting knowledge without sapping us with assignments. If you do ALL the suggested optional readings, you will surely need more time beyond 4-6 hours a week. I am glad they were downloadable for later reference. Glad I enrolled and finished. There's enough here to apply intelligently back in the working world.

I learned a lot of general concepts of Big data etc . The "Knowledge transfer" module was the most helpful for me since I am assigned in the committee for Succession Planning at my work - a non-profit company. So I was able to explain the importance of knowledge capture and building the structure of a company so that when key staff is gone, their knowledge is left behind in the company. To me this is one concrete example of how I applied what I learned from this course to my work place. I recommend this course to anyone because the concepts are applicable whether you work in business, social sciences, non-profits, etc. The instructors esp Prof Tsui is great and the format was easy to follow. They provide something for everyone. For the price of $50 for a certificate, you will not lose. I put in more than the 4 hrs pr week required because I am a slow learner i guess. :)</review><course_id>45487</course_id><course_title>Knowledge Management and Big Data in Business</course_title><reviewer_id>114140</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-10-09</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I think as they have said the courses have opened my mind in many things i didn't now before. thanks to the instructors.</review><course_id>45487</course_id><course_title>Knowledge Management and Big Data in Business</course_title><reviewer_id>114117</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-10-09</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Essentially, a three part course covering Knowledge Management, Cloud, and "Big Data."

I am new to programming, and I started this course immediately after completing Coursera's Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (also an excellent course). One of my goals as a beginning programmer has been to learn good programming habits early. In the Python course, I noticed that I was able to get things to work after a lot of trial and error, but my code was far from elegant at times. This course gave me exactly what I was looking for - a systematic way to design programs. The course started with an introduction to Beginning Student Language and the DrRacket programming environment and quickly moved into the design recipes for functions, data, and interactive programs. A key concept that Prof. Kiczales emphasized is that the design of data drives the design of functions. At first, things seemed to move slowly and the design recipes seemed excessively elaborate for the simple functions that we were writing. However, as Prof. Kiczales promised, everything came together in the last few weeks when we learned how to apply the design recipes to increasingly complex problems, such as fractals and search problems. For me, the highlight of the course was in the last week when Prof. Kiczales began demonstrating how to write a brute-force Sudoku solver and I stopped the video and decided to write it on my own. It took me a while, but I followed the design recipes and broke the problem down into smaller and smaller pieces until I finally got it. I finished the course with increased confidence, knowing that I was developing the skills to be an effective programmer. A major reason this MOOC worked and was so successful is because Prof. Kiczales and the TAs put a lot of effort into it. It was obvious that Prof. Kiczales cared deeply about what he was teaching. He explained concepts very thoroughly and clearly and would often go through entire examples in detail. (While I appreciated this thoroughness, I did find it helpful at times to speed up the video.) In addition, he and the small army of TAs were consistently active in the forums helping to answer students' questions. There were some glitches, as this was the first offering of the course as a MOOC. Most notably, the quiz questions based on the homework were sometimes confusing and difficult to interpret. However, the efforts of Prof. Kiczales and the TAs to clarify any confusion and exclude the confusing questions from grading more than made up for that shortcoming. Overall, I would highly recommend this course to those interested in learning a systematic approach to programming, and I'm looking forward to the offering of Part II.</review><course_id>45321</course_id><course_title>How to Code: Systematic Program Design - Part 1</course_title><reviewer_id>55660</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-09-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>When I took this course, I had done some basic programming in Python, and that was it. Professor Kiczales taught me things about data structures and best practices that other courses won't or can't unless you've already mastered one language. While the language used in the course, a limited subset of Racket, is clearly best as a teaching language, I feel that using a subset of a dialect of Lisp gave me something of a heads-up on functional programming concepts I would encounter later. It's true that the difficulty curve accelerates as the course goes on, but they also gave us plenty of warning that that'd be the case. The pace of the material definitely kept me engaged. More than anything, I'd say this course really helped me nail decomposition and abstraction, and writing unit tests. Several of the courses I've taken since have had modules just on problem- solving in programming, in response to a real demand for them from self-taught novices (like me), and I've been able to skim or skip all of them because this course made those concepts and methods crystal-clear. Often this was done through sheer repetition, but the individual problems were varied and increasingly challenging, so it didn't get boring. A year later, I'm still proud of the work I did in this course, which, if you program, you know is a rare occasion (since you're leveling up constantly). If you're interested in Felleisen &amp; Co.'s How to Design Programs/the Program by Design curriculum, I don't think there is any better introduction available online.</review><course_id>45321</course_id><course_title>How to Code: Systematic Program Design - Part 1</course_title><reviewer_id>2954</reviewer_id><review_date>2013-08-06</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I'm tried to study how to build good programs over two years. I'm not including my prior experience of programming in university or in childhood (Z80 assembler was a tough but interestin thing). I read books, viewed lectures and completed problems of cs106a, but using all this stuff I still not grasped the principles until now. This course for first two weeks a very easy to learn. Third week a little hard but in terms of proper notation and forcing myself to follow the recipes. Next weeks was very hard for me, harder that cs106, but easier then Functional programming using Scala of Martin Odersky (which I still didn't complete). And yes, only at third week I discovered that we using a functional programming principles. First of all I was happy about it. And I also was very scared because for me functional programming was a very mysteries and hard thing. Now, when course is nearly over (today I will take an exam), I understand that this course could be using as a good trampoline for learning Scala or Clojure because it explanes all useful things from very begining. You will learn how to think - how to formulate a problem and separate the problem on little tiny parts (yeah, I thought that I have such skill but I was wrong), how to process "knowledge shift" which will help you not to transform your function in combine-line piece of something mystical, you will learn how to understand structure of existing program (and not only on student language). Course is little raw - it smaller that original (but staff promise that second offering will contain missing parts), they had some errors in formulation problems in quiz, workload increases very fast and last three weeks I spent a great amount of time to make homework and peer grading projects. But if you follow a two principles "trust natural recursion" and "follow the design recipes" you will complete any problem. When you complete this course you will get a new vision on problems and ways of its solution as I got it.</review><course_id>45321</course_id><course_title>How to Code: Systematic Program Design - Part 1</course_title><reviewer_id>2952</reviewer_id><review_date>2013-08-06</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Introduction to Systematic Program Design aims to teach non-programmers and novices how to program by providing a methodology for solving computational problems. Instead of introducing syntax and control structures and illustrating their use, the lessons teach how to approach design problems by starting with an analysis of the data. Once the data has been analyzed and identified, templates are used in order to work towards function definitions. The templates are not a form of cookie-cutter programming, but provide a means of breaking down the problem domain into more manageable pieces. With the problem broken into parts, it is far easier to identify the relationships between data and functions. One or more small functions are then crafted to meet the requirements of the data. Underlying the methodology is an attitude and approach to systematic problem solving. The class loosely follows "How To Design Programs," of the Program By Design project, and uses this book as its supplementary text. It is not a mere duplication of the work, and I found that I gained the most understanding through close use of both the lectures and the book together. In particular, the book makes explicit certain relationships between data structure and function design which were not made obvious to me through the lectures. There are also many additional practice problems in the book, which is certainly helpful in gaining a practical understanding of the material. The first two weeks of the class were extremely easy. Weeks 3-6 were a good challenge requiring a substantial increase in effort and time. Weeks 7-8 were downright difficult and I spent many additional hours on these weeks. In retrospect, I believe that had I approached the earlier material more rigorously, and spent more time with the book, that the later weeks would have been easier and possibly quicker. As it was, I only realized as I was beginning to sink in Weeks 7 and 8 that I had not sufficiently mastered the earlier material, particularly of Week 6, and that I had not gained a thorough enough understanding of the relationship between data and the templates being used. I gave the class high ratings. My subtraction of half of a star is mainly due to pacing, and a slight tendency to favor trust of the templates without completely developing the relationships between data and function. The foundation for the templates is fully developed in the text of How To Design Problems. Rather than changing the lectures, I would recommend making the HtDP book an explicit requirement. As it stands it is only referenced as a supplementary resource for each week of work. I realize heavy use of a book may be unpopular for an online class, but believe the strength and complexity of the material calls for it. I am very glad that I had the opportunity to take this class, and plan to continue practicing and working with this material as I make my way back through How To Design Programs on my own. I look forward to Part 2 of the class.</review><course_id>45321</course_id><course_title>How to Code: Systematic Program Design - Part 1</course_title><reviewer_id>115090</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-03</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I have been programming for about 3 years now. I feel like this course is excellent for beginners and intermediates. If you are a beginner who takes this course don't feel discouraged. A lot of these things may seem complex. Your goal for taking this course is to get an understanding of how to design your code in a clean way. Save the course notes. In your programming future you will be able to look back at it, and understand it better. As for the intermediates that take this course.. the BSL syntax isn't exactly pretty. I understand why the professor chose that language though. It's easier for the beginners to understand. Also it prevents the more experienced from complaining the entire time because you want nothing to do with JavaScript or Python. The course is very clear and informative if you already have a few programming years under your belt. I'm excited to take the things I learned, and apply them in the future. Thank you Professor Kiczales.</review><course_id>45321</course_id><course_title>How to Code: Systematic Program Design - Part 1</course_title><reviewer_id>3135</reviewer_id><review_date>2013-08-30</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>This class is based on a deep principle: the structure of your data determines the structure of your program (at least at the lowest level). This insight allows you to think more systematically and understand what code you will need to write before you start writing it: what a function does, what data types it should consume and produce, test cases to verify it works correctly and a structural template that defines the skeleton of the function -- all before you write any code. The course teaches these principles using a small subset of the Racket language called Beginning Student Language (and Intermediate Student Language in later assignments). Due to this and the emphasis on recursion, this class would make a good prerequisite course before taking something like Dan Grossman's "Programming Languages" or Martin Odersky's "Functional Programming Principles in Scala." On a minor critical note, the pacing of the first offering of the course felt awkward to me at times. For example, the first weeks are deceptively easy and can make the design method seem very pointless and tedious. By the time you get to a topic like mutual recursion, it's obvious that the design recipes are much more interesting and valuable, but some students may not have had the patience to reach that point and others that found the first weeks about right may feel totally overwhelmed. If you do have the patience to make it through the course (to either slog through the slower material or stick with the tougher bits), I think you'll find it rewarding. Overall, this is a great addition to Coursera's computer science landscape, which I think will continue to improve with further iterations. It's worth checking out if you are a new programmer who would like to start off with a good feeling for how programs are structured instead of just how they are written in a particular popular language or if you're more experienced and want to get a gentle introduction to some deeper concepts beyond the syntax of your favorite language.</review><course_id>45321</course_id><course_title>How to Code: Systematic Program Design - Part 1</course_title><reviewer_id>2715</reviewer_id><review_date>2013-07-09</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Let me disagree with the previous post. Like this course very-very much. After CS50 it is much easier to understand and for beginners it will be one of the best choices. Besides, CS50 falls into different topics and languages (Scratch, C, PHP) and this course will give you the basic knowledge of any programming language on the example of one of the simpliest (Dr.Racket). Moreover, the tasks in this course are much more interesting than those of CS50. On Week 4, for example, you'll deal with interactive animations, and all this along with learning to write beautiful code.</review><course_id>45321</course_id><course_title>How to Code: Systematic Program Design - Part 1</course_title><reviewer_id>116792</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-12-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>My journey started with trying to study SICP , few days later i found out about this 3 part course , it's been an awesome experience , the entire course is very clear and tackles complex subjects in a very methodical way , those subjects would be otherwise extrelemly overwhelming for people with little or no experience in programming , my favorite topics in this course (lambda functions , abstract functions , closures , doing recursion over arbitrary-arity trees ) after taking this course , utilizing what I've learned is more like second nature , just make sure to exercise a lot , you will be dreaming recursively in no time HAHA inception style . many many thanks to the people who worked on this course , i will try to get the verified cert. and promote this course to show my appreciation and gratitude to everyone who worked on providing the world with this awesome free priceless knowledge (also many thanks to creators of the HTDP book and racket lang )</review><course_id>45321</course_id><course_title>How to Code: Systematic Program Design - Part 1</course_title><reviewer_id>41950</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-07-14</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I took this course as a refresher of my 15+ years old class in Uni. It introduces complex programming paradigm in a very practical way and most of the time it is transparent to the learner (unless you already have good notion about software engineering). And the "artificial" programming language forces the learner to focus on the content without a need to worry too much about the form (which many other programming classes focus on). I find it very refreshing as many people pretend to know how to program just because they know all the tricks of C++ or Python or ???. This course teaches how to build a robust program, the programming language is not so relevant. I strongly recommend this course for someone who would like to structure a bit their programming method.</review><course_id>45321</course_id><course_title>How to Code: Systematic Program Design - Part 1</course_title><reviewer_id>4118</reviewer_id><review_date>2013-12-06</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Just want to post here to point out how absurd the bottom (1-star) review is. In case you don't know, for over 20 years MIT (as well as Berkeley, and several other universities, if I'm not mistaken) has been using Lisp as the language to use for introduction to programming, only to change to Python about 5 years ago. The book Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs(SICP) is like a bible. Learning OOP straight away is totally misleading and dangerous for new programmers. Therefore I'm glad to see there's such a course out there to introduce people to the world of programming by simplified Lisp. Those who don't understand the good part of it, probably don't have the qualities to become a good programmer either. So stop posting ignorant and foolish "reviews" won't they if they don't understand a thing. Totally ridiculous.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45321</course_id><course_title>How to Code: Systematic Program Design - Part 1</course_title><reviewer_id>3345</reviewer_id><review_date>2013-10-06</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>First of all I dropped the course cause I hadn't time to complete 2nd assignment (there were 2) and final exam. Even this way I got the certificate. So you can imagine I did pretty well in the rest of the course (the easy part to be honest). But you can imagine how much I learned in this course cause I want to take it again to finish it properly. The course tries to teach a way to program systematically. It starts really slow, maybe from week 1 through to 4. But as course progresses you start seeing the point of everything, how everything relies on previous concepts and new concepts enables you to do a little bit more. Many people complained about language and tools used (Dr. Racket and its programming languages) I do understand them but, hey it's supposed to teach a method not a programming language. Probably you cannot achieve same goals with more complex languages. I would recommend this course for people with some programming experience. People who knows what a function is, what is an if/else statement... people who know the basics (just the basics) and feel comfortable with them. I don't give 5 stars cause my course version (8 weeks) required too much work at the end compared to the first weeks. I think you need more time to absorb final weeks. I think course now lasts 12 weeks.

While they say it is a introductory programming course those who had never programmed before seems to have a hard time with this course. But If you have already made some programs on you own, then this course is perfect. I took this course for the systematic programming part, I wanted to find out if there was any idea I could use for automatic programming. While nothing directly applicable for that purpose, I learned how to program almost without thinking :-) They teach you a set of recipes you follow from information to data structures to function temples to unit tests to concrete functions. It feels like the programs almost write themselves. A nice course which made me a better programmer even through the first couple of weeks was very easy and a little boring.</review><course_id>45321</course_id><course_title>How to Code: Systematic Program Design - Part 1</course_title><reviewer_id>120211</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-04-10</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Really interesting course, also for skilled programmers, there are a lot of informations 'nice-to-know'.

As a mid-level software dev, I was quite surprised that the courses "flavor" of programming language was very backwards from what one might see in a common programming language. Even the arithmetic is coded oddly, and out of order from standard mathematical practices. In my opinion, this simply confuses and intimidates new programmers rather than helps them. You're throwing too much at them all at once. You're asking them to learn to code and simultaneously re-learn how to read and write mathematics. And if the student is somewhat familiar with a language, this forces them to re-learn common coding syntax as well. It seems like it would be more useful to familiarize the student with modern coding languages.</review><course_id>45321</course_id><course_title>How to Code: Systematic Program Design - Part 1</course_title><reviewer_id>113414</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-09-24</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I'm glad I found this course. this course is amazing!

Further, there is no explanation regarding the dialogue and teaching. I liked the part about the vocals at the beginning. I also liked the saying of the words but complete sentences would be better in order to solve the dialogue video matter. The instructor is good.

Good structured lessons and interesting topics. Two flaws however. Firstly the content is in Taiwanese Mandarin, which differs in many ways from Mainland Mandarin, so it is really only useful if you plan on visiting Taiwan. Secondly you are really only taught to memorize and regurgitate phrases, and there is not a lot of content about actually LEARNING the language, such as grammatical points. However I acknowledge the limitations and constraints of online learning and think the team have done a great job considering the medium. I will definitely participate in the future courses, the teacher Estella is fun and friendly and the course can only get better with time.</review><course_id>45337</course_id><course_title>Basic Mandarin Chinese – Level 1</course_title><reviewer_id>114169</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-10-10</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>I think I will learn a lot in this course and I believe the instructor will help me in this expectation of mine.</review><course_id>45337</course_id><course_title>Basic Mandarin Chinese – Level 1</course_title><reviewer_id>111640</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-08-15</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I definitely loved the course.

I'm finding the material very good for a beginner like me. A few notes: Approch the course as a useful source for self learning (which it essentially is), a web language course cannot be what you'd get from being with and talking with a teacher as you would at school. This can also be a good thing since it forces you to make an effort yourself and this itself can be rewarding. Also you don't need to understand everything in the lessons all at once, a good program should always offer a little more to explore for the good student. If you are struggeling then suplement your self learning with other sources (you should end up doing this anyway).

I am guessing that it is simple memorization but haven't really been instructed to do so. I have studied other languages (i.e. Spanish, Turkish and Russian) and have been able to a correlation between the letters in the language, especially Russian, to those in English. That doesn't seem possible with Mandarin. On the other hand, for a basic course it is well laid out walking through typical words, phrases and situations a newcomer to China would experience. So far it has been an enjoyable experience &amp; I wish I had more time to dedicate to learning it. I plan to go back and review each week before the final exam. I enjoy the Instructor and find it cute the way she emphasizes the tones, which I admit are very important in Mandarin, while she is using slightly off emphasis on some American words. Again, I wish there was some connection between Traditional and Hànyŭ Pīnyīn but I think the class is valuable to those just starting to learn the language.</review><course_id>45337</course_id><course_title>Basic Mandarin Chinese – Level 1</course_title><reviewer_id>110546</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-07-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>First and foremost, I wish to thank everyone involved in putting this course together and offering it for free.

Cute fish logo for "red herring," guys. For those interested in, you know, knowledge that might lead to actual conversation about issues and solutions, I'll just mention that there are two other classes on EdX that deal with climate science, and the one from MIT called "Global Warming Science" has a session starting in February 2016.</review><course_id>27498</course_id><course_title>Making Sense of Climate Science Denial</course_title><reviewer_id>116641</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-12-12</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I really like "multidisciplinary" aspect of this course.

Everyone has been subjected to decades of extensive propaganda intended to delay and resist urgent climate action. Unlike other social issues where strong response has been delayed, such as decades of continued tobacco consumption, there's no more time for delay, and dire consequences have already been incurred. Citizens have a responsibility to be well informed and capable of knowledgeably discussing and debating the details for political progress to be made, but the playing field has been slanted by vast sums spent creating doubt and delay. This course is like a rock in David's slingshot, aimed against Goliath, and you know how that ended. I thank all the organizers and speakers for a job well done.</review><course_id>27498</course_id><course_title>Making Sense of Climate Science Denial</course_title><reviewer_id>120026</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-04-02</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course was amazing. I considered myself very knowledgeable about climate change already, but I really learned a lot through this course! I learned a ton about denial, why it happens, and how to combat misinformation.

We ARE polluting the planet in many different ways; we also broke off the correlation of CO2 and temperature cycles tremendously at the start of the 20th century, but only for the CO2 curve. The earth has always been in flux with these. Scientists that broke their silence (and lost funding) are out there, telling you what's what. Disinformation comes from the most official sources, sadly. The anthropogenic argument is only pushed to further the social acceptance of a global fascist regime.</review><course_id>27498</course_id><course_title>Making Sense of Climate Science Denial</course_title><reviewer_id>119303</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-03-12</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is an impressive course. I have just about finished, just waiting for peer review of my final essay. If you want to get a better understanding of how other people think and how you think, and to appreciate the politics of climate change as well as the science of climate change, this course is well worth doing. Climate change is happening now. In this course you will learn HOW we know this, through many lines of evidence. You will learn what is driving current climate change, how serious it is, and what we can do about it. You will learn WHY it is such a huge issue.</review><course_id>27498</course_id><course_title>Making Sense of Climate Science Denial</course_title><reviewer_id>118215</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-02-05</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Interesting and insightful content that tightly combines an overview of climate science with sociologically-justified presentation techniques.

The course shares scientific evidence that tells us that the earth is warming, it's caused by human activity and the consequences are dire. The course provides information that shines a light on a groundless debate and how the public is being duped by the biggest beneficiaries of the status quo. My takeaway is disturbing- immediate intervention is warranted and we're not even close to dealing with this in a rational manner. I'm not sure people in the developed world are capable of understanding the truth- that our way of life, powered by fossil fuels, is putting the entire planet at risk.</review><course_id>27498</course_id><course_title>Making Sense of Climate Science Denial</course_title><reviewer_id>116886</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-12-20</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>I am not impressed with the heavy reliance on random student marking which in my opinion is an inappropriate way to grade learner performance and understanding. instead it results in a random mark which can be quite insulting after all the work put into an essay. This course makes things worse by making it so that you can not pass without doing random student assessments. Some Harvard courses deliberately limit random student grading to 10% to minimize this problem. As a result I'll watch the lecturers but won't be completing.</review><course_id>27498</course_id><course_title>Making Sense of Climate Science Denial</course_title><reviewer_id>116861</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-12-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Content was an overview of the latest relevant science delivered by the experts in each area of research, as well as a discussion on the associated myths used to debunk the science. I had a lot of unanswered questions in the first two weeks of the course but found that these were all actually covered and resolved as the course progressed. I was also wary of being brainwashed into believing that climate change is human-caused but found as the course progressed, there is plenty of scope to form your own views based on the research and evidence presented. So I would say stick with the full course, note down your doubts and questions and make sure you resolve them during the course. I found the presentation of course material, videos and transcripts, a flexible and effective way to learn and I particularly liked the interviews with the experts in the each area of research and to learn and hear their views first hand. Always the best to learn from someone with a passion for their area of expertise. Overall a great course.

Here is my feedback: 1. Very good structure (order of the section, content, combination of materials) 2. It was fantastic that you kept your videos under 1 minute most of the times! Short and to the point! Extraordinary! 3. The options provided for answers in the multiple choice exercises were very well chosen and helped to reinforce the knowledge. 4. The grammar notions provided in the course are mostly relevant as they allow someone to express themselves (i.e. expressing future, past tense and opinion) without needing to memorize complicated verbal structures. Overall, the course has a well optimized level of difficulty so it will be easy enough to complete and challenging enough to keep the student interested. Thank you and looking forward to your next course!

I am doing some additional research to help me out with a few things, but that is always good when a course tweaks your interest enough to want to pursue it further. I did learn to speak Spanish as a very young child, when my family lived in Venezuela. I hope this course will retrieve some of that knowledge from the deep recesses of my grey matter. The pronunciation has thrown me off a bit...all of the th-th-th's which are not used in Latin American Spanish, but which have made it all the more fun to learn.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>49835</course_id><course_title>Introduction to MongoDB using the MEAN Stack</course_title><reviewer_id>119389</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-03-15</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Fantastic course.

Cons: Lecture is too fast and not easy to follow. Not enough hands-on sessions for beginners. Homework super easy if one has good background but super tough for ones lack of background. Simply the course is not resented with enough guided info for beginners to follow. (CS50 is much better on this point, where they have very difficult question but give you enough info for anyone to follow. I could pass all the test but I don't feel I learned that much. In the end due to some of the content is not provided via the course, I could not run the whole website can hack it myself from then on. (For example, in Homework4, I don't see where the so-called "server folder" is, and I could not just run "node index.js" as described to start the server and run the website myself. Somehow I feel the course if made in a hurry and only targeting at very experienced users. However if that is the case, I still feel the homework then becomes way too easy for those experienced students. All in all, not one of the best learning experiences on edX.

You're taken through not just the theory of Project Management, but you're also given detailed examples to refer to, as well as frequent discussion questions to get you thinking practically about how a project is handled as it progresses. Instructor videos (with sidebar and downloadable transcripts) further walk you through the fine details of each stage, and weekly knowledge checks are given based on the information that was taught. In addition, there are lots of downloadable handouts of diagrams and that are relevant and crucial to the project management process. Anyone who says that the knowledge checks ask random questions based on information that wasn't taught, clearly did not utilise the wealth of information that is provided each week. If you take this class seriously and approach it as you would in a classroom setting - that is, paying attention to the videos, utilising the handouts and saving or taking notes from the transcripts - you will be able to pass each knowledge check and have a good understanding of how to manage a project.

The culture is diverse, no one photo is going to represent its entirety. If we assume someone raised within a Spanish culture does not need to do a course on Spanish language and culture, then the image needs to be externally identifiable. As someone raised outside Spanish culture, bullfighting and flamenco are on the surface, representative, as would be images of conquistadores and tapas (how many are reading this with dispair?). From an external perspective it's not whether the image represents the whole culture, but what is easily identifiable and differentiating from other cultures.

Some of the previous reviews have already pointed out the grammatical errors so let me make a comment about the pronunciation: it looked like the instructor couldn't decide which pronunciation to adopt: the south american or the castillian.The heavy american accent only made things worse. As far as flamenco goes, I don't see any stereotyping here.

I don't doubt the good will of the staff and perhaps the content is amazing. I'm just surprised that in a course where so much emphasis is placed on grammar, I found in 10 minutes quite a lot of blunders (NuevO Inglaterra? SemEnalmente?) that a normal Word spell check could detect. Then, to record myself and upload a 2 minutes monologue to Youtube or Vimeo, I am just sensitive about my privacy and distrust these tools. About the usage of the flamenco bailarina as symbol of the course, I don't consider it improper. After all, thinking about Norway we might all recall fiords and trolls, about UK bobbies and fish&amp;chips;, about Argentine the drink mate and the vast pampa plains. Isn't there more than that? Of course, but the mental association wouldn't be so strong worldwide. Having said that, I'd have chosen the Alhambra, the Doñana National Park or an Olentzero.</review><course_id>35719</course_id><course_title>AP® Spanish Language and Culture</course_title><reviewer_id>71294</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-02-19</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Bueno me parece muy interesante lo comentado sobre el tema del flamenco, su procedencia y demás, pero sin ánimo de molestar España es mucho más que flamenco, no en vano y refiriéndome a la danza exportamos bailarines, un ejemplo, Angel Corella Estrella American Ballet Theater, como Angel unos cuantos por la geografía mundial, así como científicos en la vanguardia de la investigación, trabajadores solidarios, proyectos espaciales, Picasso, Falla, Lorca, Unamuno y tantas otras personas que nos definen como pueblo y todo ello pese a los diferentes gobernantes que hemos sufrido y que han obligado a la diaspora, bien por su falta de preparación, incapacidad o simplemente ausencia total de sensibilidad hacia la cultura, la investigación.

Please read a history book instead of using wikipedia... 2\. Again... Franco is dead for good, Thanks God. Please do not use Franco to create a fairly tales about Spanish history, . 3\. Flamenco borned before Franco and your ghost... 4\. I encourage you to come to a "Sara Bara's" or "El Cigala's" flamenco concert and you will feel what is Spain itself. History of Flamenco Dance To point out the stomping feet and fiery passion is merely brushing the surface of flamenco dance. Flamenco dance, as one-third of the quintessential Spanish phenomenon of flamenco, has an extensive historical background that parallels the cultural development of Spain itself. Hailing from southern Spain's outcast populations, flamenco dance and music drew early influences from Greek and Roman and later from Indian, Moorish, and Jewish cultures. With the arrival of the Moorish and Jewish populations to the Iberian peninsula centuries ago, Andalusia's already thriving music and dance inadvertently began extracting characteristics from the newly-arrived populations. The flamenco dance and music that we see today are the dazzling results of centuries of absorbing and flawlessly sewing together elements of this myriad of diverse cultures. With the flourishing development of flamenco music emerged the equally rapid evolution of flamenco dance, which first appeared recognizeably as a structured dance in the 18th century. While flamenco's design in its origin revolves around the hearty voice of the singer, the impassioned flamenco dancers stunned audiences in special music cafés - called cafés cantantes - and quickly began stealing the show. Centuries of cultural melding later, what ironically began in caves as a form of personal expression by gypsies and other oppressed ethnicities has evolved into the flashy flamenco dance and music that has taken the world by storm.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45491</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Mao Zedong Thought 毛泽东思想概论</course_title><reviewer_id>116654</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-12-12</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I am happy to see edX put up a course teaching the ideological fundamentals that contributed to rising China from a semi-colonial and semi-deudal state to today's modern China.

I wasn't really sure what to expect since the course had 1 week listed as the duration: it a short one- sitting type of course that is just one of several installments the lecturer is planning to offer. The main lecture content raises many interesting concepts about big data and social physics but there is not enough content and each section concludes with the professor referencing his book and telling you to go read it to learn more even though the book is "not required." Basically, you’re given a bunch of interesting ideas and visualizations to whet your appetite and then the lectures fade to a picture of the book. I'm not sure whether this course is really trying to teach students or masquerading as a course while functioning as infomercial for the book. It's too bad because it is a fascinating topic and I feel that the lecturer could have made a good course if he took the time to create a 6-8 week MOOC that covered all the material in depth.</review><course_id>34528</course_id><course_title>Big Data and Social Physics</course_title><reviewer_id>33451</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-05-25</review_date><review_value>1</review_value><review>While some interesting concepts were touched on, this "course" was a joke.

I agree with some of the other reviewers saying that the course felt like an advertisement for the instructor's book, which I'm sure that like myself, a lot of the students in this class must have purchased.

This was probably the worst I've tried so far (and I've done quite a few already here and on other platforms too). The video quality is bad and the entire course is poorly organised. On week 2 they've restructured the course and they discarded all the scores and our progress from week 1. Then on week 4 they've introduced an additional week so our scores dropped again which means that our progress was shown incorrectly throughout the entire course. The forums are poorly managed too. We are asked to answer questions in the discussion forum (which is great in theory) but in practice we ended up with hundreds of threads in the exact same topic - needless to say I stopped following the discussions. Judging by some of the frustrated comments, you have to be very lucky to get response from a teaching staff. There is inconsistency in the scoring (in addition to discarding the points) and in the number of submissions available (2 submissions for a True of False question - where is the value in this???? --&gt; And then they've corrected it for week 5). We've even had trouble with the correct answer not being listed amongst the answers.

I don't really learn very well from lectures. Call it personal preference. Call it years of Engineering, but simply watching video lectures, video lectures that are not that interactive with examples, are not conducive to absorbing and retaining material. The same goes for reading sample literature. The best way to learn, in my opinion, is by practicing concepts, and there was very little opportunity to apply what was learned. I think this was the attempt of the applied lectures each week, but spending several hours actually working problems would be a more efficient way to drive home concepts. The homework in the course was too easy, and the R examples were simply copying and pasting, rather than letting somebody try to develop skills in R. Yes, they could do it on their own, but they could do it on their own without taking this course. From a practical standpoint, a lot of charts presented in the lectures were unreadable. From a schedule standpoint, starting the class at a time when people are on vacation or visiting families seemed unnecessary. I still have the Bayesian week remaining, so maybe the course will improve. I will still continue on with the track, because I am interested in Machine Learning.

I don't get why the other reviews like this course. Literally no idea. It's unstructured and low quality. The homework/tests are horrible. They are set up in the most inconvenient way, spread out in small sets, and most of them you can get a perfect score in, as long as you remember what your previous choices were. Seriously, you don't even have to read the answers to get a perfect score on these. Overall very poor course. I was planning to take the whole xSeries with certificates, but with these prices, and this lack of quality, I will most likely not. Very dissapointing. Would demand refund. Pro's: It's got Andrew Gelman in it. Con's: The rest.</review><course_id>49839</course_id><course_title>Statistical Thinking for Data Science and Analytics</course_title><reviewer_id>117203</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-12-31</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>I was excited to take on this course, but I had to drop it because I would simply not be able to complete it. Since I am working full time, I would have to rely on my free time to complete it. However we are talking about 12+ lecturers per week, with multiple questions after (almost) each one of those lecturers which are due in a week. I found that to be unrealistic for someone with my schedule, and this is the first edx course I had a problem concerning a time-frame. Plus I found it hard to follow the first instructor. I think that she should have rehearsed before each recording, and more effort should have been invested in the subtitles. It is a shame because I was really looking to do the entire series of courses, but unless the deadline for homework is laxed I don't see that happening unless I take some time off.</review><course_id>49839</course_id><course_title>Statistical Thinking for Data Science and Analytics</course_title><reviewer_id>115994</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-23</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Soy ingeniero en sistemas en Ecuador, veo que el curso es muy completo y los instructores son de primer orden</review><course_id>49839</course_id><course_title>Statistical Thinking for Data Science and Analytics</course_title><reviewer_id>119815</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-03-26</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>This Columbia Data Science XSeries was nothing more than an improvisation, and an overpriced one.

Although I'm reasonably certain that all of the instructors are brilliant, I got the impression that some of them were coerced into doing this and didn't really want to be there. The level of the material presented varied widely and often didn't correspond well with the homework. This is an important and timely topic, and I'd like to continue with the other parts - but not until they get their act together.

The lectures were substantive in many cases, but dry in the presentation. Examples were frequently boring. Assignments often didn't match the level or depth of the topics presented. The language on the tests was sometimes ambiguous, making it difficult to understand the questions being asked, as though perhaps intended to trick. Some answers were actually incorrect, with many students commenting on time wasted trying to recalculate and understand what they were doing wrong. (Nothing!) The correct answers were never explained, so it was not possible to learn from any mistakes. Staff replies to questions and issues raised in the forum were neither timely nor frequent enough. I plan to continue the series and hope for improvement in the subsequent courses.</review><course_id>49839</course_id><course_title>Statistical Thinking for Data Science and Analytics</course_title><reviewer_id>117820</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-01-22</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>Since I had no previous experience with statistics, I ended up with more handwritten notes than I wrote in the whole first year of university studies. To my surprise, it was a high-intensity course with a few glitches, but a good content. + well presented content, mostly easy to follow + all lecturers knew what they were talking about + recommended reading + challenging - out of 5 lecturers, one was really difficult to understand to such degree even the subtitles seemed to use the word "inaudible" more than "statistics" - out of the 4 other lecturers, one was so unenthusiastic about the teaching that if you had her as a lecturer at your university, this subject would either ruin your attendance record, or it would be the class to take a pillow to - some glitches with the homeworks (e.g. correct answers not available) - I spent about a double of the suggested study time to complete this course, not easy for full-time employees - forum appeared mismanaged, lots of threads on the same topic</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>49839</course_id><course_title>Statistical Thinking for Data Science and Analytics</course_title><reviewer_id>117804</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-01-21</review_date><review_value>1</review_value><review>Worst course I've ever done... extremely disappointed.

I kept hoping it would get better, but by the last week it had not. I'm not going to continue with this XSeries. It was unclear what they were trying to accomplish. It was in a no-man's land between a survey and then trying to get deep into something. But never building background knowledge before trying to drill slightly into something. There was a 20+ page assigned deep philosophical musing on Bayesian modeling and whether anything in the world is really inductive. But this wasn't preceded with even a basic description of what Bayesian statistics are. There are so many great examples to introduce people to priors and posteriors, but this wasn't done. Of course, there were bright spots. The course exposes you to a lot of ideas and applications. I think these are bound to inspire me at some point when I'm stuck on a problem. There was a very cool political-belief model based on your age and when you are exposed to popular vs. unpopular Presidents as you age. Fascinating to see how a whole age-class of citizens is molded a certain way based on the era they pass through.</review><course_id>49839</course_id><course_title>Statistical Thinking for Data Science and Analytics</course_title><reviewer_id>117747</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-01-19</review_date><review_value>1</review_value><review>I just finished the course with %100 of the final grade.

It has interesting material to learn but the way it is presented is not good at all. If i didn't have prior knowledge of statistics i would quite possibly not be able to understand and follow this course to a decent degree, because the lectures have a lot of information and move fast. It doesn't offer enough opportunity to practice the things you learn through exercises and the ones that it has do not particularly help you understand and internalise the lecture material. So you end up watching a lot of videos about theory and not retaining much due to lack of practice. I sincerely hope that the next course in the series takes these points into account and improves.</review><course_id>49839</course_id><course_title>Statistical Thinking for Data Science and Analytics</course_title><reviewer_id>117687</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-01-17</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>It's very unclear who this course is supposed to be for. It skims shallowly into some topics in the lectures, then dunks you into a long technical pdf that you have to read to answer the "quiz" questions. Luckily it's easy (if you're a native English speaker) to skim the technical articles and guess the answers, so I got an A+ despite only understanding bits and pieces. The assignments remind me of high school busywork. You are often presented with new equation with one worked example, then quizzed only once on it before moving on to something else. There are no projects or any practical work that unifies the very different topics discussed in the course. Don't expect feedback from admins or assistants or instructors in the discussion questions. The admins do not respond at all to numerous student requests to correct errata in the site, like the correct answer not being available to choose. The professors will write equations and say "you don't really have to know the equation", or will tell you abstractly about the ideology they used to do an analysis without describing what the analysis is. The result is, you don't learn the intuition, and the ideology doesn't make sense without context. Pros: some of the lectures, particularly those criticizing classical/Frequentist statistics, are really interesting. But they only hint at something deeper and do not go into depth, and do not guide you toward entry-level external materials that you can pursue on your own. Overall: it's an interesting broad survey of topics in data analysis, but don't expect to learn how to actually do even simple data analysis. There is essentially no hand-on component of the course. Much of the meat of the course is in a grab-bag of links to external articles which are either very simple or very technical.</review><course_id>49839</course_id><course_title>Statistical Thinking for Data Science and Analytics</course_title><reviewer_id>117620</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-01-14</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>well this course is very interesting but , i prefer more videos instead papers, the teachers are wery well they know the several topics, but in the 3 week I don't have time to complete and for this reason don't pass this course in general is very very interesting the next week i take one certified about data Analystic here in Peru, this course was very important for me, i would like to be a data science in the future,</review><course_id>49839</course_id><course_title>Statistical Thinking for Data Science and Analytics</course_title><reviewer_id>117541</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-01-12</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course is structured well.

Nope. But this short course offers a nice introduction, particularly if you already have some exposure to C. The course covers the basics of C++ data types, input/ouput, control statements, and simple classes. Written materials are provided and the lectures, which are very good, emphasize the practical points. Not everything is taught from first principles, though, so if you're new to C-style programming, you may find yourself facing unfamiliar terminology now and then; fortunately, there are plenty of tutorial resources on the web, including ebooks. The assignments could use some improvement: the quizzes are easy and the small amount of actual programming is unfortunately peer-reviewed, which is not well suited to the subject matter. Microsoft should consider providing coding windows that allow you to enter code and have it compiled and executed -- that's the way most programming courses do it, and it would improve the effectiveness of this otherwise worthwhile introduction considerably.</review><course_id>48808</course_id><course_title>Introduction to C++</course_title><reviewer_id>119238</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-03-10</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>This is a good introduction course to C++. But as a starter of C++, one needs some programming experiences in other languages to take this course. The lectures are not always easily understandable and memorable due to lack of requirements for hands-on from the students. Further, unlike other EdX class, the handout does not have summary class slides to guide the students. The assignments are good -- interesting and challenging.

You will not leave this course with any more skills than you brought to it. I would only recommend this course as a survey of the discipline of Machine Learning and some of it's principles. I would DEFINITELY NOT pay for the certificate for this or the X-series as I did. Worst $350 I ever spent. Reasons below. As with the rest of the courses in the X-series, this course was poorly conceptualized, organized &amp; executed. The material veered wildly from rudimentary to overly complex (&amp; inadequately covered) to often entirely irrelevant (no one will be taking this course to learn basic genetics, yet there were several lectures and quizzes covering it). The assessments (again, like the rest of this series) were often wrong, and more often so poorly worded as to be impossible to discern the actual question. Sometimes the assessments covered material not even covered in the lecture or reading material. Some of these were acknowledged by the course staff and some questions had to be discounted or supplemented by extra credit questions added to the end of the course. This was also the case in the previous (first) course in the X-series. Hopefully this will be fixed in subsequent offerings, but it was an issue in all 3 courses of the series, and no effort seems to have been made to improve it throughout those offerings. The staff also did not do a very good job of managing the discussion board or being responsive. All that said, there were some good info and lectures, and CUx's video lecture technology is the best I've seen. If just watching the videos as a sort of introduction to the practices and principles of the discipline, it can be enjoyable and even a bit illuminating. But don't expect to leave with any practicable skills. And definitely don't expect a proper educational experience.</review><course_id>49844</course_id><course_title>Machine Learning for Data Science and Analytics</course_title><reviewer_id>119089</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-03-04</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>This course is not what it wants to be: First 2.5 weeks are a repetition of algorithms 101 followed by an introduction to genetics. The final 2 weeks are about machine learning. In the algorithms part, there is some code but for the interesting part, there is just some explanation about the statistics behind and the algorithm names. The questions after first 2 weeks are mostly about vocabulary intepretation and partially even about genetics and preterm birth without any relation to algorithms or machine learning. The answers were sometimes wrong, the reaction to complaints was slow if it happened at all. In the end, the passing grade was reduced to 50% due to this. For two of the topics, the instructors where really difficult to understand due to their accent and mostly bad microphones. The captions were no help as they said "inaudible". This course was a waste of time. I continued till the end because I was hoping that there is yet something to come.

The homeworks are incredibly challenging and assume prior knowledge of advanced calculus, graph theory, complexity theory, and statistics. The lectures do not provide enough information to complete the assignments. The homeworks are all one or two problems with only one check. There is no explanation about answers if it it wrong.

So far, this course has been one frustrating experience - quite possibly one of the worst-organised courses I have taken on edX (and I've taken about 30 or so). The black background on all lectures makes lecturers' writing very difficult to see, even in HD. The lecturers themselves could easily send one to sleep - I had to play videos at 2x speed to stay awake. The quiz questions are typically a huge jump up from the lecture video material, and you only get one (two, on rare occasions!) attempt at answering, making the seemingly reasonable pass mark of 60% suddenly difficult to achieve. Recently, the course providers suddenly decided to add additional quiz questions at the end of the course, and there have been answer errors and badly phrased questions that I (English first language) found damn near impossible to understand. The prerequisites are understated (when did high school math automatically entitle Chi-Square distribution knowledge? when did having some exposure to programming enable one to perform string matching on genome sequences?). The lecturers never bothered suggesting which software to use (e.g. R) making it daunting for a data science newbie to answer some of the questions as unsure where to begin. A positive aspect is that the course material is actually quite interesting so I'm trying to hang in there. At least I'm not on the Verified Certificate track, I would honestly be very disappointed if I had paid for this.</review><course_id>49844</course_id><course_title>Machine Learning for Data Science and Analytics</course_title><reviewer_id>117743</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-01-19</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I'm an academic researcher utilizing qualitative and quantitative methods of inquiries.

Otherwise the content is informative and helpful - thanks for that. The instructor is always visible, reducing screen space for the barely visible Excel sheets and the action that is going on there. There are better MOOCs out there which you should learn from. The provider edX: well done, 5 stars.

The content in first 5 weeks is basic and hence if you have some basic knowledge of Excel also..this might not be of much use. Datanitro is good but not much of use as its not freeware. Neo4j is nice tool but I felt there should have been much more help from course staff in case of issues posted in the course. The content in the videos are hard to follow as they are slanted at an angle in the screen. Overall, I would rate this as an average course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45492</course_id><course_title>Solar Energy</course_title><reviewer_id>117768</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-01-20</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review/><course_id>45492</course_id><course_title>Solar Energy</course_title><reviewer_id>117649</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-01-15</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I am interested to learn about solar energy do you accept senior student?

This course is short so it will not take too much of your time and could reasonably be done in parallel with some other courses on edX. The focus on "engineers" is true as the content is tailored to mindsets of most engineers exposed to leadership. This course makes great job of showing the breadth of knowledge, techniques and self-coaching that forms leadership training. It may be short and tries to cover very broad material, but it actually does not feel too shallow and instead provides motivation to research many of the raised issues further either by reading referenced literature or searching for more on your own. Highly recommended if you feel that you may need to work on your communication or managerial skills. One disclaimer though - the course tries to argue very strongly about a rather "political" view on leadership which may feel pushed too much as the "correct" way. If you approach the content in a open-minded view instead of trying to pick on points that you may not agree with, there is a lot to learn even for an engineer who is always deeply involved in a project based work within hierarchical organization.</review><course_id>48828</course_id><course_title>Leadership for Engineers</course_title><reviewer_id>118526</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-02-16</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>I really liked this course. The team did an excellent job and I thank for that. I know it is difficult to change mindsets but it is time to learn more about this complex world, in which the positivism is always trying to simplify and reduce.

It's more like a generic leadership course. The course is relatively short, but there's still some good useful information and skills to learn. I'd say it's worth the time I spent on it, just don't go expecting anything engineering-specific. Or if you're not an engineer, just ignore that "for Engineers" part of the title. This course does have some peer review assessments. There are pros and cons, but for the most part, I do appreciate the fact that someone peers can provide useful feedback and constructive criticism.

I'm sorry Erik, I admire you and your work, but I can't help myself but to share my honest opinion: Cons: \- Video lectures are, and I can't stress this enough, NOT enough if you want to fully understand the material. \- As a consequence of the previous point, some homework questions seem like as if they have fallen from the sky. \- Homework is divided into programming exercises (~10%) and quizzes. The programming exercises (except for the last lab) are WAY too easy compared to the quizzes, which is the real deal regarding pushing your knowledge on this to the limit. If you try to do the quizzes without trying out the answers in the interpreter first (like I did, at first), you WILL have problems. \- Some of the questions' difficulty is related to small details, which can be frustrating, especially since you only get 1 try. I just failed a question where we had to pick the right proof by induction for a given equality, and the difference between my answer and the right one was 1 + x vs x + 1 (missing usage of commutative property in the 1st one). It is said several times throughout the course that you will need to either read the book or google the subject by yourself and that is COMPLETELY true. I had a reasonable informal exposure to the topic but still struggled to make it trought the homework. If you plan to gain some knowledge, even if you don't get to 90%+ grade, this is a great course, but you won't be able to understand the material just by the MOOC itself, extra study will be needed.</review><course_id>34676</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Functional Programming</course_title><reviewer_id>61319</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-12-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This was an amazing course! Background: \- I have been programming for over 30 years, starting in BASIC as a child, wending my way through Pascal in school and then professionally in FORTRAN and C and C++ (before there was a standard, an ARM, or even a compiler: we used the Glockenspiel translator to convert our C++ code to C), eventually ending up spending a decade or so writing Java before experimenting recently with Groovy and Clojure. \- My degree is in engineering, not CS, so I lack a lot of the formal theory of many of my colleagues. \- I've completed about six MOOCs before, but this was my first EdX course. There were a number of aspects of this course that I thought were done particularly well. \- The lecture videos were short, 6 to 12 minutes on average. \- Each lesson provided multiple instructional formats, including lecture videos, references to external reading, standalone homework problems, cumulative labs. \- Nearly all exercises could be solved by use of the interactive Haskell environment. I used GHCi. \- The discussion forum was active and on-topic. \- The instructor and staff were very active and visible in the discussion forum. \- Spoon-feeding was discouraged. Thinking was required. Some students complained about several features of the course: \- Most exercises allowed only a single submission. =&gt; Since most exercises could be solved using GHCi or equivalent environment, it was expected that the student would attempt to work through the exercises to arrive at the correct answer. \- Code in exercises was provided as an image and not as copy-paste- able text. =&gt; Copying and pasting allows the student to bypass examining the code. In typing the code, the student is forced to inspect the code in minute detail, paying attention to the subtleties of syntax. \- Not everything was presented in the videos. =&gt; Students were encouraged to consult auxiliary materials. Multiple references were provided in the wiki and in the discussion forums. Again, the onus is on the student to provide effort in learning. This commentary was linked in the discussions and sums up the teaching philosophy of this course: http://www.wired.com/2013/10/telling-you-the-answer-isnt-the- answer/</review><course_id>34676</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Functional Programming</course_title><reviewer_id>66876</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-01-05</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>I did learn a lot, but I have a mixed feeling about the course. If you feel enthusiastic about learning Haskell and have some idea what is it like, you should take it. If you are curious what is it like, it's probably better to read some introductory tutorials before taking it. Lectures are good, but not sufficient for completing the labs and homework, you'll have to read additional material. Some homework questions have little connection to corresponding lecture content. Some lectures are supplemented with links to academic papers (if you get into functional programming, you'll end up reading research papers anyway, why not to start right now). Homework is quite extensive and really helps you check your understanding. However, lots of it is about reading bizzare code, and it gets annoying (fortunately, deadlines don't force you do the whole assignment in one day). Lab assignments vary from mindlessly pasting code into GHCi to very fun and engaging tasks like implementing a fancy datastructure to almost inhumane tasks like reverse engineering logic from type signatures. In any case, I did learn what I wanted to learn and I liked the course despite its problems.</review><course_id>34676</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Functional Programming</course_title><reviewer_id>61351</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-12-22</review_date><review_value>1</review_value><review>I expected to learn about FP and Haskell. I did learn a lot but I spent 3 times as much time on this course than advertised. Clearly there is a lot to learn and I could follow in the first few weeks, but after week 7 I could not follow any more as the concepts were not being explained very well and I found it very demotivating. I searched online, I read books, to no avail. Here is a list of things I did not like and would encourage them to improve: \- They failed to teach the concepts. \- The lectures are too short; the topics are not covered in any sort of detail. \- We only get 1 shot at the questions. That's fine if we re told at least why we got it wrong. You could at least provide students with the answer so that they get a chance to learn from their mistake. Otherwise, what is the point of the course? \- The lectures did not cover what was suggested in the exercises. The disconnect between the lectures and the exercises was so great from the middle of the course onwards, you would have thought that it was someone completely different who wrote them. \- The exercise questions were so poorly written as to be incomprehensible at times. \- The organisers seem to have forgotten what it was like to learn Haskell. \- I did not get a copy of the recommended book and in retrospect I should have done. They state that it is recommended, not definitely needed. The lectures alone were not sufficient, though, to understand the material and to do the exercises.</review><course_id>34676</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Functional Programming</course_title><reviewer_id>66826</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-12-31</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is a tough course, but it is well worth it if you want to learn functional programming via Haskell. Whatever amount of time you think you will spend on the course can be doubled or tripled. It takes time because it is a declarative model compared to a imperative one that most programmers are used to. If you've had calculus or recent algebra, it is a plus, but if you're willing to do the work, you can get by with little math, but be prepared to review, re-learn past math.</review><course_id>34676</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Functional Programming</course_title><reviewer_id>61393</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-12-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Outstanding, I can't recommend this course enough. The labs force you to write Haskell code, and were a joy to complete. The community was active in the discussion boards. When I got really stuck on a question I could count on active discussions about the topics. Cons: \- I wish he introduced more types of Monads than just the IO monad. \- There can be multiple homework assignments for the same due date, so be aware of that. I missed two homework assignments that way. Anyway that's my fault.</review><course_id>34676</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Functional Programming</course_title><reviewer_id>117499</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-01-11</review_date><review_value>5</review_value><review>The first half of the course was easy; the material was really detailed, sometimes even boring. But there were tiny signs in the tests that did not fit to this slow, easy but work-a-lot learning model. For example language elements not discussed in the lessons and questions which just tested how many indirections your mind can handle (or alternatively how good you are in copying and testing the code). But the possibility to check after each question really motivated me to continuously repeat and improve my knowledge. The second half of the course was terrible, they just came up with the monads and without describing it the boring, detailed way, suddenly everything was based on it. I had to search for additional materials and put a lot of extra work to understand the concepts. Maybe it would have been easier if I read the book, but heeeey, I managed to reach near 100% in the tests of first half of the course without any extra effort or reading the book. I was so close to the overall 60% that I only needed to reach a few points in the second half. So the course was unbalanced, period. And if I read the book why would I need the course? This course is not an introduction, and not about functional programming. It is about Haskell, and possibilities of Haskell and creative use of Haskell, but not about understanding the functional paradigm and building a structured solid knowledge. There is hardly any real world application mentioned. If you want to build a compiler or a graphical engine in Haskell and you studied abstract algebra before (I did) then this course is maybe for you.</review><course_id>34676</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Functional Programming</course_title><reviewer_id>117327</reviewer_id><review_date>2016-01-06</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Great introduction course to functional programming.

It should be noted, however, that this course should be taken only after gaining familiarity with Rails. I would suggest working through Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial beforehand, at least. Without that knowledge, the course will likely be too hard if you are new to Rails or at least a similar MVC framework. Even with familiarity of another framework, I suggest working through the tutorial. It can be done in an afternoon or over a few days pretty easily.</review><course_id>14123</course_id><course_title>Agile Development Using Ruby on Rails - Basics</course_title><reviewer_id>36666</reviewer_id><review_date>2014-06-24</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>If you want to learn everything presented in the course from just taking it, you will be disappointed.

I have all the prerequisites: I know Ruby (and Java, Python), I refreshed it before the start, and the first two weeks were normal. Then in week 3 started the assault: acronyms everywhere, snippets of code with new commands and no explanation whatsover, HTML, HAML, databases migrations and operations, controllers, views, actions, HTTP protocols and routes, redirects, ecc. All this with no explanation at all, and the 3rd homework that asked to modify a rails application (it's more than a dozen different files) where no idea where to start. The prerequisites for this course are severly lacking: you must know about everything I talked about before, or have the time to learn all of it in a week.

I'm not a great fan of survey classes, hence the relatively low mark. The teaching materials in this class are on the great side, and it covers a lot of important topics in software engineering.

It's a good course, you kind of need to do part 2 since part 1 teaches you the basics (you actually only spend like 3-4 weeks in Rails). Assigments can be challenging. Quizzes are definitely challenging and very tricky. Overall I recommend the course and I'm definitely going to do part 2.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45189</course_id><course_title>Enhancing Teacher Education Through OER</course_title><reviewer_id>115848</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-11-19</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Course is very much beneficial for teacher educators teachers.It gives different ways of class room teaching.Instructer i know very well.

The material is straightforward but basic. The instructor is clear and concise. The automated grading of the first Quiz is so horribly broken that I had to drop the course. What's the point; I can't be bothered to wait to fix the course when I could use my time to focus on a much more difficult, thorough, tested, and complete course: MITx 6.00.1x. This course might be suitable for a beginner - next time they run it and fix the grading problems. If you can take a beating and want to learn Python, I suggest punishing yourself with a very serious course: MITx 6.00x.</review><course_id>45518</course_id><course_title>Learn to Program Using Python</course_title><reviewer_id>117155</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-12-29</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>I too have no prior knowledge of programming.

For those not familiar with West Coast vernacular, this is not a positive statement. I heard a lot of words that said very little. There is no real analysis or detailed description of the architecture. Instead half the mark for the course is for you to write down your thoughts and then have some random student judge your thoughts resulting in a mark that is really just a flip of the coin. There is very little learning here. Like I said, totally lame, don't waste your time.</review><course_id>36405</course_id><course_title>The Search for Vernacular Architecture of Asia, Part 1</course_title><reviewer_id>72566</reviewer_id><review_date>2015-03-02</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>A good introductory course to the novice of Architecture!
