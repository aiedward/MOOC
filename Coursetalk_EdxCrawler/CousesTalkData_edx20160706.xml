We’ll discuss and debate topics such as placebos, the paranormal, medicine, miracles, and more. You will use the scientific method to evaluate claims, make sense of evidence, and understand why we so often make irrational choices. You will begin to rely on slow, effortful, deliberative, analytic, and logical thinking rather than fast, automatic, instinctive, emotional, and stereotypical thinking. We will provide tools for how to think independently, how to be skeptical, and how to value data over personal experience. We will examine the mental shortcuts that people use and misuse, and apply this knowledge to help make better decisions, and improve critical thinking.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=36404</url></Course><Course><course_id>36320</course_id><title>Introduction to Environmental Science</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>232</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Andrew J.

Michael Murray, Joby Bernstein ’17, Chloe Madill ‘17, Sawyer Broadley</instructor><school>School:  Dartmouth College</school><description>Introduction to Environmental Science, ENVX, was first offered in early 2015. Environmental science is the study of patterns and processes in the natural world and their modification by human activity.  To understand current environmental problems, we need to consider physical, biological and chemical processes that are often the basis of those problems. This course will give you the skills necessary to address the environmental issues we are facing today by examining scientific principles and the application of those principles to natural systems.  This course will survey some of the many environmental science topics at an introductory level, ultimately considering the sustainability of human activities on the planet. Environmental impacts on Earth come from the number of people and the amount and types of resources that they use. By applying scientific principles and considering real-world examples, we will examine: The field of environmental science and how to think like an environmental scientist The human population and the ways in which changes in the population affect the environment Agriculture, soils and the environmental implications of eating meat, vegetables, local, organic, sustainable, industrial and other types of food Non-renewable fossil fuels with a focus on coal, petroleum and natural gas and the benefits and consequences of using each Renewable fuels such as wind and solar and identify that even renewable “green” energy sources have impacts as well as benefits Biodiversity and global change, which are the integrating units of environmental science Education method The course will utilize video lectures, interviews with experts, readings, discussions, multiple choice and prompted discussions and one graded quiz per week. There will also be several optional live office hours on Google Hangouts. Completion of self-assessments, contributions to discussion and quiz scores will determine the final grade. </description><url>/enroll?course_id=36320</url></Course><Course><course_id>69742</course_id><title>The Analytics Edge</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>124</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Dimitris Bertsimas, John Silberholz, Iain Dunning, Angie King, Velibor Misic, Nataly Youssef, Allison O'Hair, Alex Weinstein, Jerry Kung</instructor><school>School:  MIT</school><description>In the last decade, the amount of data available to organizations has reached unprecedented levels. Data is transforming business, social interactions, and the future of our society. In this course, you will learn how to use data and analytics to give an edge to your career and your life. We will examine real world examples of how analytics have been used to significantly improve a business or industry. These examples include Moneyball, eHarmony, the Framingham Heart Study, Twitter, IBM Watson, and Netflix. Through these examples and many more, we will teach you the following analytics methods: linear regression, logistic regression, trees, text analytics, clustering, visualization, and optimization. We will be using the statistical software R to build models and work with data. The contents of this course are essentially the same as those of the corresponding MIT class (The Analytics Edge). It is a challenging class, but it will enable you to apply analytics to real-world applications.  The class will consist of lecture videos, which are broken into small pieces, usually between 4 and 8 minutes each. After each lecture piece, we will ask you a “quick question” to assess your understanding of the material. There will also be a recitation, in which one of the teaching assistants will go over the methods introduced with a new example and data set. Each week will have a homework assignment that involves working in R or LibreOffice with various data sets. (R is a free statistical and computing software environment we’ll use in the course. See the Software FAQ below for more info). In the middle of the class, we will run an analytics competition, and at the end of the class there will be a final exam, which will be similar to the homework assignments.   FAQ What do I need to know about the topic prior to enrolling in the course? You only need to know basic mathematics. For most people, this is equivalent to basic high school mathematics. You should know concepts like mean, standard deviation, and histograms. This course is also useful for those who already have experience in the subject.  In each lecture, recitation, and homework assignment, we use a different dataset and case to illustrate the method. Even if you are familiar with all of the methods taught, you can still learn a lot from the different examples. What software will be used in the course? We’ll be using two software programs in this class: R and LibreOffice. Both are free online, and you don’t need to be familiar with either of them to take the course. R is a free statistical and computing software environment and LibreOffice is similar to MS Office but a free open source program. Specifically we’ll use the LibreOffice module, Calc in this course. Don’t worry though - we’ll teach everything from scratch!</description><url>/enroll?course_id=69742</url></Course><Course><course_id>45260</course_id><title>HTML5 Part 1: HTML5 Coding Essentials and Best Practices</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>78</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Michel Buffa</instructor><school>School:  The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</school><description>HTML5 is the standard language of the Web, developed by the World Wide Web Consortium, also known as W3C.

We don't know why the Big Bang happened. We don't know what most of the universe is made of. We don't know whether there is life in space. We don't know how planets form, how black holes get so big, or where the first stars have gone. This course will take you through nine of the greatest unsolved problems of modern astrophysics. We can't promise you the answers, but we will explain what we do and don't know, and give you an up-to-date understanding of current research. This course is designed for people who would like to get a deeper understanding of these mysteries than that offered by popular science articles and shows.  This is the first of four ANUx courses which together make up the Australian National University's first year astrophysics program.

Virtually every day brings news about some “miracle food” that we should be consuming or some "poison" we should be avoiding. One day it's tomatoes to prevent cancer, then flaxseed against heart disease or soybeans for menopause. At the same time, we are warned about trans fats, genetically modified foods, aspartame and MSG. Dietary supplements are often touted as the key to health or a factor in morbidity. According to some, dairy products are indispensable while others urge us to avoid them. The same goes for meat, wheat and soy; the list goes on. This course will shed light on the molecules that constitute our macro and micronutrients and will attempt to clarify a number of the food issues using the most relevant, up-to-date science available. Other topics to be presented will include the diet-cancer relationship, the link between diet and cardiovascular disease, food-borne illnesses, food additives and weight control.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=69983</url></Course><Course><course_id>34704</course_id><title>Justice</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>61</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Michael J.

The course will empower you with skills to address important aspects of business operations including capacity, productivity, quality, and supply chain. You will understand how operations in an organization are configured and factors that can potentially drive the complexity of managing such operations. We will also introduce concepts like estimating capacity, identifying bottlenecks, and de-bottlenecking. Throughout the course, you will join us in discussions on productivity improvement methods, development of quality assurance systems and configuration of supply chains. The course will equip you with the right tools, techniques and skills to estimate, compute, analyze and configure key elements of operations management.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=45484</url></Course><Course><course_id>45521</course_id><title>Chinese Thought: Ancient Wisdom Meets Modern Science - Part 2</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>27</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Edward Slingerland</instructor><school>School:  University of British Columbia</school><description>This course is designed to give students a thorough introduction to early (pre-221 BCE) Chinese thought, its contemporary implications, and the role of religion in human well-being. Important themes to be discussed include the ideal of wu-wei or “effortless action,” the paradox of how one can consciously try not to try, mindfulness techniques and self-cultivation, models of the self and society, rationality versus emotions, trust and human cooperation, and the structure and impact of different spiritual and political ideals. This period of Chinese history witnessed the formation of all of the major indigenous schools of Chinese thought (Confucianism, Daoism, Mohism and Legalism), which in turn had an impact on the development of East Asian cultural history that is still felt today. We will also explore parallels with Western philosophical and religious traditions, the relevance of early Chinese thought for contemporary debates in ethics, moral education, and political philosophy, and the manner in which early Chinese models of the self anticipate recent developments in the evolutionary and cognitive sciences. This course provides a full university semester’s worth of material broken into two parts. Each part of the course will last five weeks with a week-long break in between. For each part, there will be four weeks worth of new material. The fifth week will be reserved for review and completion of the final exam. Part 2 builds upon Part 1 by exploring late Warring States thinkers such as the Confucian Mencius, the Daoist Zhuangzi, and the return to externalism in the form of Xunzi—who believed Mencius betrayed the original Confucian vision—and his former student Hanfeizi, a “Legalist” thinker who helped lay the foundations for the autocratic system that unified the Warring States into China’s first empire. We will conclude with some reflections on what it means to study religious thought, and the thought of other cultures, in a modern, globalized world. Part 2 can be taken as a stand-alone course, but will be more comprehensible and rewarding with the background provided in Part 1.

You see them every day: on clocks, in the stock market, in sports, and all over the news. Algebra is all about figuring out the numbers you don't see. You might know how fast you can throw a ball, but can you use this number to determine how far you can throw it? You might keep track of stock prices, but how can you figure out how much money you've made (or lost) in the market? And you may already know how to tell time, but can you calculate at what times a clock's hour and minute hands are exactly aligned? With algebra, you can answer all of these questions, using the numbers you already know to solve for the unknown. Algebra is an essential tool for all of high school and college-level math, science, and engineering. So if you're starting out in one of these fields and you haven't yet mastered algebra, then this is the course for you!   In this course, you'll be able to choose your own path within each lesson, and you can jump between lessons to quickly review earlier material.

You will earn a professional certificate from the University of British Columbia and edX upon successful completion of this course. Certificates can be uploaded directly to your LinkedIn profile. FAQ How much effort is required? Since this is a design-based course, students in previous courses have put in between 3-25 hours/week, depending on their background, interest, and the level of complexity of their chosen project. There are also many optional modules in the course, completing all the optional modules increases the time required. What are the prerequisites for taking this course? Phot1x is targeted at an audience with a wide range of backgrounds who are committed to learning the material and completing the course design project. The prerequisites are introductory physics, and optics, for example an undergraduate optics or electromagnetics course. Background in microwave/RF would be an asset. No background with integrated optics is assumed. The course uses various computer software, hence a background in basic computer programming is beneficial (e.g., MATLAB, Python). Do I need to buy a textbook? The notes, videos and exercises are all sufficient to complete this course. The textbook is optional. Included in the course are several key chapters from the book "Silicon Photonics Design", by Lukas Chrostowski and Michael Hochberg, published by Cambridge University Press. The full version (ebook or hardcopy) is available for purchase at www.cambridge.org/9781107085459. What are the fabrication details?  Your devices will be fabricated on a Silicon on insulator (SOI) wafer with 220 nm silicon thickness, with a minimum isolated feature size of 60 nm. Each participant is allocated 410 µm x 605 µm of space, enough for &gt;10 devices each (more available on request). One chip is being manufactured and measured for this course, and the measurement data will be provided to the course participants.  Who will be doing the fabrication and measurements? The fabrication will be performed by Richard Bojko, at the University of Washington, Nanofabrication Facility. The measurements will be performed by the team of Lukas Chrostowski, at The University of British Columbia. Will I be getting a physical chip in the mail? No. Only one chip is being manufactured for this course, and the measurements will be performed at UBC. The measurement data will be provided to the course participants. Are there opportunities for fabrication beyond this course, including getting chips in the mail? Yes. Either after, or during the course, you can purchase an entire chip. It will be sent to you directly. Optionally we can perform automated testing for you prior to sending it out. We typically do fabrication runs every two months. Additional options for  obtaining your own chips (EBeam or MPW foundries) will be discussed in the course. Do you have any advanced silicon photonics courses, and what can I take after Phot1x? Yes. We offer advanced courses on silicon photonics, including on-site hands-on workshops on Passive silicon photonics (ring resonators, grating couplers, Bragg gratings, etc); Active silicon photonics (modulators, detectors); CMOS electronics for photonics; and Systems, Integration and Packaging. All these workshops include fabrication via MPW foundries. More details can be found at http://siepic.ubc.ca. Phot1X is a good background course for the above workshops.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=45463</url></Course><Course><course_id>51344</course_id><title>Introduction to Banking and Financial Markets- I</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>21</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  PC Narayan</instructor><school>School:  Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore</school><description>Banking and financial markets encompass the ‘ecosystem’ that (a) channelizes money from those who have it (i.e., savers/investors) to those who need it (i.e., borrowers) and (b) facilitate cross-border flow of funds through exchange of currencies. That ecosystem of banks and financial markets (including Central Banks) has deepened in size, sophistication and complexity over the years. However, in recent times they have also been the subject of abuse, failures and economic distress in several countries resulting in a ‘contagion’ that has concurrently impacted several countries around the World!  More recently, and perhaps more importantly, thanks to the liberalization of most economies, the world has witnessed an exponential increase in the free flow of capital across countries. Banking institutions and financial markets, being the predominant conduit for such free flow of capital across countries, have therefore become even more ‘globally interconnected’. Such a globally interconnected financial system, combined with regulatory systems that are country-specific and hence varying considerably in rigor and implementation, has further compounded the risks and the consequent contagion, as witnessed in the global financial meltdown that was triggered in 2008. This course titled “Introduction to Banking and Financial Markets” will be delivered in two parts. The first part will help you demystify the role of banking and financial markets in any country, the products and services they offer and the underlying market mechanisms. The second part of the course will examine the risks embedded in banking and financial markets, how these risks have been heightened because of a globally interconnected world and the regulatory and governance mechanisms to minimize adverse outcomes in such a complex system.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=51344</url></Course><Course><course_id>69973</course_id><title>User Innovation: A Path to Entrepreneurship</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>11</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Erdin Beshimov, Eric von Hippel</instructor><school>School:  MIT</school><description>We’ll let you in on a secret. Innovation isn’t confined inside the walls of research labs swarming with PhDs. More often than not, innovation is about ordinary people solving problems that matter to them personally. This could be you. First, think about what you need. Next, find out whether others want the same thing. If they do, you can start a venture – for profit or non-profit - to supply others with the novel product or service you first developed for yourself. The examples of user innovation are infinite. A surfer created the GoPro to take “selfies” while surfing. A student came up with Dropbox after forgetting his flash drive. Two broke entrepreneurs rented out their living room to help pay rent, and Airbnb was born. They’ll share their paths to startup success. Taught by Eric von Hippel, the founding scholar of user innovation, this course will help you think about what problems you should choose to solve and how to share your innovations with others. You can innovate.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=69973</url></Course><Course><course_id>45206</course_id><title>Introduction to Bootstrap – A Tutorial</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>10</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Christopher Harrison</instructor><school>School:  Microsoft</school><description>Bootstrap is an open source project originally created by Twitter to enable creation of responsive, mobile first web pages.

This Java course will provide you with a strong understanding of basic Java programming elements and data abstraction using problem representation and the object-oriented framework. As the saying goes, “A picture is worth a thousand words.” This course will use sample objects such as photos or images to illustrate some important concepts to enhance understanding and retention. You will learn to write procedural programs using variables, arrays, control statements, loops, recursion, data abstraction and objects in an integrated development environment. This course is comprised of two 5-week parts. Part 1 introduces programming fundamentals. Problem solving Primitive data types and arithmetic expressions Object-oriented programming basics Branching and Loops Arrays Part 2 covers the following topics. String manipulation File I/O Simple event-driven programming Recursion Abstract data types FAQ What software will be required for this course? We will use Java Platform, Standard Edition Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Platform, Standard Edition Development Kit (JDK) to give the computer the capability to run java programs and use BlueJ as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for developing Java programs. Which version of Java will be used in this course? The course is based on Java Version 7. It is fine that if you would like to use Java Version 8, but the new features introduced in Version 8 will not be covered by this course. What are the system requirements for MS Windows users? Java Version 7 and BlueJ are supported by MS Windows XP or above (except Windows RT). Java Platform, Standard Edition Runtime Environment (JRE) will need to be installed on the system. You will also need Internet Explorer 8+ or Firefox 3.6+ or Google Chrome to access the demonstration programs on the course web site. Documentation on the setup details can be found in the course handout to be given in week 1. What are the system requirements for Mac users? Java Version 7 and BlueJ are supported by Mac OS X 10.7.3 (Lion) or above. Java Platform, Standard Edition Runtime Environment (JRE) will need to be installed on the system. You will also need Safari 5.1.3+ or Firefox 3.6+ (64-bit) to access the demonstration programs on the course web site. Google Chrome is not supported. Documentation on the setup details can be found in the course handout to be given in week 1. What are the system requirements for Linux users? Java Version 7 and BlueJ are supported by Ubuntu/Debian Linux. OpenJDK, an implementation of the Java Platform, Standard Edition Development Kit (JDK), will need to be installed on the system. You will also need Firefox 3.6+ to access the demonstration programs on the course web site. Documentation on the setup details can be found in the course handout to be given in week 1. Can I use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) other than BlueJ? In this course, we would recommend BlueJ to beginning programmers as it is compact and provides just enough features for learning programming. Most of the programming examples in this course assume using BlueJ. However, you may use other professional IDEs such as Eclipse and NetBeans according to your own preference. Will I be required to view Java Applets for learning the course materials? There will be some demonstration programs shown as Java Applets in this course. However, these applets will only act as supplementary materials. Inaccessible to the applets would not affect the learning of the course materials. To access the applets, you will have to enable or activate Java plug-in on the browser. The plug-in requires 32-bit version of Java Platform, Standard Edition Runtime Environment (JRE) on MS Windows, 64-bit version of JRE on Mac OS X or 32/64-bit version of OpenJDK on Linux depending on the architecture of the system.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=69555</url></Course><Course><course_id>27203</course_id><title>Calculus 1B: Integration</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>10</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  David Jerison, Gigliola Staffilani, Jen French, Karene Chu</instructor><school>School:  MIT</school><description>How long should the handle of your spoon be so that your fingers do not burn while mixing chocolate fondue? Can you find a shape that has finite volume, but infinite surface area? How does the weight of the rider change the trajectory of a zip line ride? These and many other questions can be answered by harnessing the power of the integral.  But what is an integral? You will learn to interpret it geometrically as an area under a graph, and discover its connection to the derivative.  You will encounter functions that you cannot integrate without a computer and develop a big bag of tricks to attack the functions that you can integrate by hand. The integral is vital in engineering design, scientific analysis, probability and statistics. You will use integrals to find centers of mass, the stress on a beam during construction, the power exerted by a motor, and the distance traveled by a rocket. 1.

Humans and animals move much more aggressively by routinely executing motions which involve a loss of instantaneous control authority. Controlling nonlinear systems without complete control authority requires methods that can reason about and exploit the natural dynamics of our machines. This course introduces nonlinear dynamics and control of underactuated mechanical systems, with an emphasis on computational methods. Topics include the nonlinear dynamics of robotic manipulators, applied optimal and robust control and motion planning. Discussions include examples from biology and applications to legged locomotion, compliant manipulation, underwater robots, and flying machines. FAQ Who can register for this course? Unfortunately, learners from Iran, Sudan, Cuba and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time. While edX has received a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to offer courses to learners from Iran and Sudan our license does not cover this course. Separately, EdX has applied for a license to offer courses to learners in the Crimea region of Ukraine, but we are awaiting a determination from OFAC on that application. We are deeply sorry the U.S. government has determined that we have to block these learners, and we are working diligently to rectify this situation as soon as possible.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=34830</url></Course><Course><course_id>35844</course_id><title>Early Christianity: The Letters of Paul</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>9</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Laura Nasrallah, Greg Given, Jennifer Quigley, Tyler Schwaller, Chan Sok Park</instructor><school>School:  Harvard University</school><description>The letters of Paul are the earliest texts in the Christian scriptures, written by a Jew at a time when the word “Christian” hadn’t yet been coined. What is the religious and political context into which they emerged? How were they first interpreted? How and why do they make such an enormous impact in Christian communities and in politics today? Archaeological materials and ancient writings will help you to enter the ancient Mediterranean world and to think about religious groups, power, poverty, health, and the lives of elites and slaves in the Roman Empire. We’ll explore how immediately controversial these letters were, and how these letters are used today to debate relations between Christians and Jews; issues such as love, law, and grace; and topics such as charismatic Christianity, homosexuality, and women’s religious leadership.   Whether you’ve been studying Paul’s letters for years or are merely curious about what Christian scriptures are, this course will provide you with information to deepen your understanding of the ancient contexts and present-day controversies about these texts.

This is an approach that more and more educators see as far more likely to ensure the success of Indigenous learners, as well as enhance the learning experiences of all students. Choosing reconciliation as a lens for rethinking policy and learning practices acknowledges that there are contradictions in the current curriculum of schooling that impact the success of Indigenous learners. Reconciliation in this course emphasizes changing institutional structures and personal and professional ideologies to create equitable and inclusive learning environments for Indigenous learners, and where all students should have opportunities to learn from Indigenous histories, traditions, and knowledges as part of a social justice education. Educators need to be able to respond to educational reforms that prioritize improved educational outcomes for Indigenous learners. In addition, educators must build the capacity of all learners to engage in relationships with Indigenous peoples based on intercultural understanding, empathy, and respect. To support these goals, teachers, administrators, young people, school staff, community-based organizations, and researchers will learn from Indigenous Elders, educational leaders, and culturally relevant learning resources as part of their experiences in this MOOC.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=36391</url></Course><Course><course_id>51341</course_id><title>First Nights: Beethoven’s 9th Symphony and the 19th Century Orchestra</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>6</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Thomas Forrest Kelly</instructor><school>School:  Harvard University</school><description>Ludwig van Beethoven’s 9th Symphony premiered in Vienna in 1824, and continues to be one of the most popular symphonies in the repertoire. The monumental symphony’s size and complexity stretches traditional instrumental forms to the breaking point, and its famous choral finale changed our view of orchestral music forever. Harvard’s Thomas Forrest Kelly (Morton B. Knafel Professor of Music) guides learners through all four movements of Beethoven’s 9th Symphony, highlighting aspects of symphonic form, describing Beethoven’s composition process, the rehearsals and premiere performance, and the work’s continued relevance today. You will learn the basics of musical form and analysis, the genres and styles used and the circumstances of this symphony’s first performance and subsequent history.

The world is also full of data. Probabilistic modeling and the related field of statistical inference are the keys to analyzing data and making scientifically sound predictions. Probabilistic models use the language of mathematics. But instead of relying on the traditional "theorem - proof" format, we develop the material in an intuitive -- but still rigorous and mathematically precise -- manner. Furthermore, while the applications are multiple and evident, we emphasize the basic concepts and methodologies that are universally applicable. The course covers all of the basic probability concepts, including: multiple discrete or continuous random variables, expectations, and conditional distributions laws of large numbers the main tools of Bayesian inference methods an introduction to random processes (Poisson processes and Markov chains) The contents of this course are essentially the same as those of the corresponding MIT class (Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability) -- a course that has been offered and continuously refined over more than 50 years. It is a challenging class, but it will enable you to apply the tools of probability theory to real-world applications or your research. Can I still register after the start date? You can register at any time, but you will not get credit for any assignments that are past due. How long does this course last? The course starts on Tuesday, February 3, 2015 and ends on the due date of the final exam, on Thursday, May 26, 2015. What is the format of the class? The course material is organized along units that are aligned with the chapters of the textbook. Each unit contains between one and three lecture sequences. Each lecture sequence consists of short video clips, interleaved with short problems to test your understanding. Each unit also contains a wealth of supplementary material, including videos that go through the solution of various problems. What textbook do I need for the course? None - there is no required textbook. The class follows closely the text Introduction to Probability, 2nd edition, by Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, Athena Scientific, 2008; see the publisher's website or Amazon.com for more information. However, while this textbook is recommended, the materials provided by this course are self-contained. Do I need to watch the lectures live? Video lectures as well as worked problems will be available and you can watch these at your own convenience. Homework assignments and exams, however, will have due dates. Will the text of the video clips be available? Yes, we will provide transcripts of all clips (lectures, worked problems, etc.) that are synched to the videos. How are grades assigned? Grades (Pass or Not Pass) are based on a combination of scores on the weekly homework assignments (11 total), two midterm exams, and a final exam. How much do I need to work for this class? This is an ambitious class in that it covers a lot of material in substantial depth. Furthermore, the only way of mastering the subject is by actually solving on your own a fair number of problems. MIT students who take the corresponding residential class typically report an average of 11-12 hours spent each week, including lectures, recitations, readings, homework, and exams.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=14098</url></Course><Course><course_id>48820</course_id><title>Computation Structures – Part 2: Computer Architecture</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>5</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Chris Terman, Steve Ward, ​Silvina Hanono Wachman</instructor><school>School:  MIT</school><description>Digital systems are at the heart of the information age in which we live, allowing us to store, communicate and manipulate information quickly and reliably. This computer science course is a bottom-up exploration of the abstractions, principles, and techniques used in the design of digital and computer systems. If you have a rudimentary knowledge of electricity and some exposure to programming, roll up your sleeves, join in and design a computer system!

This urban planning course will focus on four areas that directly affect livability in a city: Urban energy, urban climate, urban ecology and urban mobility. The course begins by presenting measurable criteria for the assessment of livability, and how to positively influence the design of cities towards greater livability. We will focus on this basic topic of the human habitat in a holistic way, and introduce possibilities of participatory urban design by citizens, leading towards the development of a citizen design science. You will be able to share your experiences with the other participants in the course and also with the experts from the teaching team. In completing this course, you will better understand how to make a city more livable by going beyond the physical appearance and by focusing on different properties and impact factors of the urban system. Livability in Future Cities is the second course in a series of MOOCs under the title “Future Cities.” This series aims to bring the latest research on planning, managing and transforming cities to places where this knowledge has the highest benefit for its citizens. “Future Cities” provided an overview, and this course will focus on livability in existing and new cities. </description><url>/enroll?course_id=69935</url></Course><Course><course_id>47124</course_id><title>Sustainable Urban Development: Discover Advanced Metropolitan Solutions</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>5</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Arjan van Timmeren, Huub H.M.

And, cities generate more than 70% of the global emissions? Large cities and their hinterlands (jointly called metropolitan regions) greatly contribute to global urbanization and sustainability challenges, yet are also key to resolving these same challenges. If you are interested in the challenges of the 21st century metropolitan regions and how these can be solved from within the city and by its inhabitants, then this Sustainable Urban Development course is for you! There are no simple solutions to these grand challenges! Rather the challenges cities face today require a holistic, systemic and transdisciplinary approach that spans different fields of expertise and disciplines such as urban planning, urban design, urban engineering, systems analysis, policy making, social sciences and entrepreneurship. This MOOC is all about this integration of different fields of knowledge within the metropolitan context. The course is set up in a unique matrix format that lets you pursue your line of interest along a specific metropolitan challenge or a specific theme. Because we are all part of the challenges as well as the solutions, we encourage you to participate actively! You will have the opportunity to explore the living conditions in your own city and compare your living environment with that of the global community. You will discover possible solutions for your city’s challenges and what it takes to implement these solutions. Your participation will also contribute to wider research into metropolitan regions as complex systems. We invite you to take the first steps in understanding the principles that will be essential to transform metropolitan regions into just, prosperous and sustainable places to live in! This course forms a part of the educational programme of the Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions and is developed by Wageningen UR and TU Delft, two of the founding universities of AMS Institute.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=47124</url></Course><Course><course_id>46962</course_id><title>The Book: Book Sleuthing: What 19th-Century Books Can Tell Us About the Rise of the Reading Public?</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>5</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Leah Price</instructor><school>School:  Harvard University</school><description>Do you love printed paper and wonder how much longer it will survive in the age of ebooks? Are you curious about how the mass-produced modern book emerged in the first place?  Come behind the scenes in Harvard’s libraries to explore the look, feel and even smell of nineteenth-century British and American books in this module of The Book: Histories Across Time and Space. In 19th-century Britain and America, schooling expanded, paper cheapened, and new technologies allowed print to reach wider audiences than ever before.  After the rare and beautiful manuscripts and books showcased by earlier modules, the mass-produced, disposable objects that survive from the nineteenth century bear witness to the rise of the reading public. This module investigates what scholars know about nineteenth-century reading, as well as how they know it. This module’s six sections guide you through underlined, inscribed, defaced and repaired books in Harvard’s collections: 1. Name That Book Find out what you can tell about a book when you’re blindfolded. 2. Handheld Books and Mobile Readers What book did one soldier carry to Civil War battlefields in his pocket? (Hint: it’s not what you think.) 3. The Pen and the Needle Did 19th-century girls have to choose between sewing and reading?  The holes pricked in one book suggest they did both at once. 4. Leaving your Mark Luckily for future historians, these children didn’t listen when people told them not to write in their books. 5. Detective Work Try out some tools that build on what you’ve learned about books at Harvard to discover the stories hidden in your local library. 6.

Editing a photo, re-mixing a song, automatically measuring and adjusting chemical concentrations in a tank: each of these tasks requires real-world data to be captured by a computer and then manipulated digitally to extract the salient information. Ever wonder how signals from the physical world are sampled, stored, and processed without losing the information required to make predictions and extract meaning from the data? Students will find out in this rigorous mathematical introduction to the engineering field of signal processing: the study of signals and systems that extract information from the world around us. This course will teach students to analyze discrete-time signals and systems in both the time and frequency domains. Students will learn convolution, discrete Fourier transforms, the z-transform, and digital filtering. Students will apply these concepts in interactive MATLAB programming exercises (all done in browser, no download required). Part 1 of this course analyzes signals and systems in the time domain. Part 2 covers frequency domain analysis. Prerequisites include strong problem solving skills, the ability to understand mathematical representations of physical systems, and advanced mathematical background (one-dimensional integration, matrices, vectors, basic linear algebra, imaginary numbers, and sum and series notation). Part 1 is a prerequisite for Part 2.

Pritchard, Zhongzhou Chen, Chris Chudzicki</instructor><school>School:  MIT</school><description>This college-level, calculus-based Introductory Newtonian Mechanics course covers all of the topics and learning objectives specified in the College Board Course Description for Advanced Placement®Physics C (Mechanics). It covers Newton’s Laws, Kinematics, Energy, Momentum, Rigid Body Rotation, and Angular Momentum. The course covers applications of these basic principles to simple harmonic motion, orbital motion, and to problems that involve more than one basic principle. These principles also underlie the 12 online laboratory activities. Our emphasis is on helping students learn expert-like ways of solving challenging problems, many of which are similar to problems on previous Advanced Placement Examinations in Mechanics C. We stress a key insight: mechanics is about forces changing motion. We apply this concept to organizing the core knowledge in a way that helps students apply it to sophisticated multi-concept problems. We feel this is the best way to prepare students for success not only on the AP Examination but also in other college-level science, technology, engineering and math courses that emphasize problem-solving. If you are a teacher looking to learn better ways to teach your students, or are interested in using some of our MOOC materials in your own classroom—possibly as a private online course for your students—we strongly encourage you to sign up for our teacher’s discussion cohort, a “private discussion room” for teachers to share pedagogical ideas and instructional techniques.To join these discussions, verify yourself as a teacher by clicking this link, and we will enroll you in the teacher’s discussion cohort. FAQ How long is this course? The course consists of 13 weeks of required (graded) material and 2 weeks of optional (ungraded) material. You do not need to complete the optional weeks in order to receive a certificate, but we strongly encourage you to complete these units, especially if you are preparing for the College Board’s AP Physics C: Mechanics exam. Is there a required textbook? You do not need to buy a textbook. A complete eText, including worked-examples and some video lectures, is included in this edX course and is viewable online. If you would like to use a textbook with the course (for example, as a reference), most calculus-level books are suitable. Introductory physics books by Young and Freedman, Halliday, Resnick, - Walker, or Knight are all appropriate (and older editions are fine). My physics is a little rusty. How should I prepare for this course? If you would like to brush-up on basic mechanics skills before taking this course, we recommend the brief warm-up course, On-Ramp to AP Physics C: Mechanics.  What if I take a vacation? The course schedule is designed with this in mind! Course content is always released at least 3 weeks ahead of the deadline, providing you with the opportunity for flexibility in scheduling. How are grades assigned? There are five parts of the course that are worth points: (1) Checkpoint problems are incorporated into the reading; (2) most weeks have an interactive lab component; (3) more involved homework problems occur at the end of each week and (4) quizzes at the end of every 1-2 weeks; (5) the course culminates in a final exam. Each category is worth a varying number of points; and you are allowed several attempts on each problem. A final grade of at least 60% is needed for certification; hence you will not have to do every problem. Note: Taking this Course Involves Using Some Experimental Materials The RELATE group that authors and administers this course is a physics education research group. We are dedicated to understanding and improving education, especially online. In one of the only published studies measuring learning in a massive open online course (MOOC), we showed that a previous iteration of this course produced slightly more conceptual learning than a traditionally taught on-campus course. Currently, we are working to find just what caused this learning.   In this course, the RELATE group will be comparing learning from different types of online activities that will be administered to randomly assigned sub-groups of course participants. At certain points in the course, new vs. more traditional sequences of activities will be assigned to different sub-groups. We will then use common questions to compare the amount of associated learning. Which group receives the new activities will be switched so that all groups will have some new activities and some traditional ones. Our experimental protocol has been approved by the MIT Committee on Use of Human Subjects. As part of this approval we have the obligation to inform you about these experiments and to assure you that: We will not divulge any information about you that may be identified as yours personally (e.g. a discussion post showing your user name).  The grade for obtaining a certificate will be adjusted downwards (from 60%) to compensate if one group has slightly harder materials. Note: By clicking on the “Enroll Now” button, you indicate that you understand that everyone who participates in this course is randomly assigned to one of the sub-groups described above.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=27189</url></Course><Course><course_id>14086</course_id><title>Flight Vehicle Aerodynamics</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>3</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Alejandra Uranga, Mark Drela, Michael Burton</instructor><school>School:  MIT</school><description>This course covers the physics, concepts, theories, and models underlying the discipline of aerodynamics.

If you would like to buy a print copy of the textbook, a mail-order service will be provided. Can I still register after the start date? You can register at any time, but you will not get credit for any assignments that are past due. How are grades assigned? Grades are made out of four parts: simple, multiple-choice "Concept Questions " completed during lectures; weekly homework assignments; and two exams, one at the midpoint and one at the end of the course. How does this course use video? Do I need to watch the lectures live? Video lectures as well as worked problems will be available and you can watch these at your leisure. Homework assignments and exams, however, will have due dates. Will the text of the lectures be available? Yes, transcripts of the course will be made available. Will the material be made available to anyone registered for this course? Yes, all the material will be made available to all students. What are the prerequisites? The student is expected to be well-versed in basic mechanics, vector calculus, and basic differential equations. Good familiarity with basic fluid mechanics concepts (pressure, density, velocity, stress, etc.) is expected, similar to the content in 16.101x (however, 16.101x is not a requirement). If you do not know these subjects beforehand, following the class material will be extremely difficult. We do not check students for prerequisites, so you are certainly allowed to try. Who can register for this course? Unfortunately, learners from Iran, Sudan, Cuba and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time. While edX has received a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to offer courses to learners from Iran and Sudan our license does not cover this course. Separately, EdX has applied for a license to offer courses to learners in the Crimea region of Ukraine, but we are awaiting a determination from OFAC on that application.

However, today's infrastructure systems are drastically changing. They are becoming more and more web-based, interconnected and transnational, with increasingly fragmented public and private ownership, while new technologies are on their way. The capital need for investment in new infrastructures and upgrading of ageing infrastructures is tremendous. During this infrastructure course you will learn to examine these challenges from a new, combined engineering and social sciences perspective. Subsequently we will focus on the challenges that complex adaptive infrastructure systems pose for governance, management and decision-making in a world full of uncertainties. In the last part of the course, we will introduce a selection of topics and tools (modeling - simulation, value sensitive design, standards, ICT-architecture) which will help you to improve the adequacy of infrastructure systems and services, while dealing with the risks and vulnerabilities of infrastructure interdependencies. In our case studies, we will focus on topical developments and policies, such as sustainable energy transition (including smart grids), urbanization and its impact on infrastructures, the challenges of climate change and water scarcity, and the phenomenon of inverse infrastructure development (self-organization).   If you are interested or involved in the functioning of today's and tomorrow's infrastructures, this course is an exceptional learning opportunity, whether you are a student or a professional. You will be interacting with peers all over the world and we will present a large number of case studies.

In The Conscious Mind - A Philosophical Road Trip, we will illuminate what we take for granted in perception, action, and interaction with others. We’ll explore this mindful awareness through demonstrations, illusions, brainteasers, thought experiments, riddles and jokes, all designed to shake you loose from your ordinary assumptions about the way consciousness works.  You will explore your own mind and the minds of others in a new way, using a philosophical approach known as phenomenology. You’ll encounter some of the main ideas of the phenomenological tradition, through short readings by Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. Their ideas are provocative and will animate the online and offline conversation as we proceed. But the main approach of the course will be experiential and experimental. You’ll learn phenomenology by doing it and journeying among the structures and elements of your own conscious experience.  </description><url>/enroll?course_id=51352</url></Course><Course><course_id>47057</course_id><title>Mechanical Behavior of Materials, Part 2: Stress Transformations, Beams, Columns, and Cellular Solids</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>3</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Lorna J. Gibson</instructor><school>School:  MIT</school><description>All around us, engineers are creating materials whose properties are exactly tailored to their purpose. This course is the second of three in a series of mechanics courses from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at MIT. Taken together, these courses provide similar content to the MIT subject 3.032: Mechanical Behavior of Materials. The 3.032x series provides an introduction to the mechanical behavior of materials, from both the continuum and atomistic points of view. At the continuum level, we learn how forces and displacements translate into stress and strain distributions within the material. At the atomistic level, we learn the mechanisms that control the mechanical properties of materials. Examples are drawn from metals, ceramics, glasses, polymers, biomaterials, composites and cellular materials. Part 1 covers stress-strain behavior, topics in linear elasticity and the atomic basis for linear elasticity, and composite materials. Part 2 covers stress transformations, beam bending, column buckling, and cellular materials. Part 3 covers viscoelasticity (behavior intermediate to that of an elastic solid and that of a viscous fluid), plasticity (permanent deformation), creep in crystalline materials (time dependent behavior), brittle fracture (rapid crack propagation) and fatigue (failure due to repeated loading of a material).  </description><url>/enroll?course_id=47057</url></Course><Course><course_id>69545</course_id><title>Sustainability in Everyday Life</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>3</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Anna Nyström Claesson, Matty Janssen</instructor><school>School:  Chalmers University of Technology</school><description>Daily headlines warn of new chemical dangers, species on the edge of extinction, global warming-- framing our planet as “at risk.” Some people stop listening, others get alarmed, while some others want to learn more in hopes of making a difference in the world.  Do you want to live a more sustainable life?

Qu’appelle-t-on « familles » et comment se constituent-elles ? Quel regard et quels types d’analyse l’anthropologie propose-t-elle sur les systèmes de parenté, symboliques, politiques, religieux ? L’anthropologie prospective nous aide à comprendre et à anticiper les phénomènes qui transforment nos modes de vie contemporains. Elle pose un regard transversal sur les actions, les pratiques et les dires des personnes avec lesquelles travaillent les chercheurs. « Entrer en anthropologie », c’est accepter de changer son regard sur le monde et de se décentrer par rapport à ses habitudes. Si vous désirez comprendre un peu mieux le monde et ses changements contemporains, suivez ces chercheurs sur leur terrain et expérimentez d’autres repères culturels. Durant ces quelques heures, vous serez amenés à débattre avec des professeurs et des étudiants autour de questions sur la famille, les migrations, les mondes virtuels ou encore les mondes des invisibles. Vous apprendrez les bases de l'approche anthropologique et ce qu'elle peut vous apporter en termes de réflexion sur votre propre société, sur votre vie et votre quotidienneté. Ce cours vous donne l’opportunité de comparer vos expériences et d’échanger vos points de vue avec des personnes d’autres horizons. Les six semaines de cours aborderont une série de thématiques illustrées par des exemples concrets de modes d’existence divers et disséminés sur le globe. Des enseignants plongés au cœur des pratiques sociales et des enjeux politiques et économiques les plus variés partageront avec vous leur expérience après des années d'immersion sur les terrains de recherche qui les passionnent. Si vous êtes curieux de tout et que comprendre votre propre société mais aussi des sociétés méconnues vous intéresse, ce cours s'adresse à vous ! How do human beings organize themselves in societies? What do we call “families” and how do they form? What type of analysis does anthropology propose about parenthood, and symbolic, political and religious systems? Prospective anthropology helps us to understand and anticipate phenomena that transform our ways of life today. It gives a cross-cutting look at the actions, practices, and words of those people with whom anthropological researchers work. To understand anthropology is to accept changing your view of the world, and to shift your perpsective of your own habits. If you want to understand the world and its contemporary changes more deeply, follow these researchers in their field, and experiment with other cultural references. In this course, you will debate with professors and students about family, migrations, virtual worlds, and the world of « invisibles. » You will learn the basis of the anthropological approach and what it can bring you as a reflection tool about your own society and your everyday life. This course gives you the opportunity to compare your experiences and to exchange points of view with people from all around the world. Professors immersed in the heart of various social practices, political and economic issues will share their experiences with you after years of research in fields that they are passionate about. If you are curious about everything, and if you are interested in understanding your own society but also unknown societies, this course is for you!</description><url>/enroll?course_id=45511</url></Course><Course><course_id>68042</course_id><title>First Nights: Monteverdi’s L’Orfeo and the Birth of Opera</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>3</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Thomas Forrest Kelly</instructor><school>School:  Harvard University</school><description>Claudio Monteverdi’s L’Orfeo premiered in Mantua in 1607, and continues to be regarded as one of the most important examples of early opera. With L’Orfeo, Monteverdi helped to establish the techniques and traditions that continue to inform the genre of opera to this day. Harvard’s Thomas Forrest Kelly (Morton B. Knafel Professor of Music) guides learners through the first half of L’Orfeo, highlighting aspects of operatic form and dramatic technique, the rehearsals and cultural context for the premiere performance, and the work’s continued relevance today. There will also be a focus on Monteverdi’s life and work as a Renaissance court musician. In this music course, you will learn the basics of operatic form and analysis, the genres and styles used, and the circumstances of this opera’s first performance and subsequent history.

There has been a lot written about the fact that human beings do not process information and make decisions in an optimal fashion. This course builds on much of the fascinating work in the area of behavioral economics and allows learners to develop a hands-on approach by understanding its methods and more importantly, how it can be harnessed by suitably designing contexts to “nudge” choice. In three modules, learners will be able to a). explain and interpret the principles underlying decision-making and compare the nudging approach to other methods of behavior change, b). learn how to critique, design and interpret the results of experiments; and c). design nudges and decision-tools to help people make better decisions. Understanding experimental design and interpretation is central to your ability to truly use behavioral economics and will set you apart from people who merely know about the behavioral research. After the first two weeks learning the basic principles, we will devote two weeks to studying experimental design and analysis, and the final two weeks to understanding processes for designing nudges and for helping people make better decisions. You will also witness and participate in weekly topical debates on various topics like “does irrationality impact welfare?” or “what strategy is better for improving welfare – nudging or education?” If you’ve been fascinated with the buzz surrounding behavioral economics but are not sure how to actually use it, this course is for you. Several leading scholars, policy makers, business people, authors and commentators will briefly join our debate and discussion sections. These guest lecturers include Professor Sendhil Mullainathan (Harvard University), Professor John Lynch (University of Colorado), Rory Sutherland (Ogilvy Group), Owain Service (Behavioural Insights Team, UK Cabinet Office), Shankar Vedantam (NPR Columnist and Author – The Hidden Brain), Professors Andrew Ching, Avi Goldfarb, Nina Mazar, and Claire Tsai, Min Zhao (University of Toronto) and many others!</description><url>/enroll?course_id=14133</url></Course><Course><course_id>65194</course_id><title>Personal Finance, Part 1: Investing in Yourself</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>3</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Ann Witte</instructor><school>School:  Wellesley College</school><description>Ready to take control of your finances?

This course is part of the MITx MicroMasters Credential in Supply Chain Management that is specifically designed to teach the critical skills needed to be successful in this exciting field. In order to qualify for the MicroMasters Credential you will need to earn a Verified Certificate in each of the five courses as well as pass a Capstone Exam.

This will provide an understanding of causes of the variation. The course will include measurements and determinants of health. Further, the course offers a public health perspective of the global burden of diseases. The course will specifically address: Maternal and Child Health; Sexual reproductive health and rights; Major infectious disease - malaria, TB, HIV, pneumonia; Non communicable disease; Mental health; Disasters; Injuries; Health systems and financing; and Health policy. Analysis will be done from a gender and equity perspective. The course combines different teaching methods: lectures, self-study, and exercises using gapminder tools (Gapminder.org) to analyze indicators. An added value is that the course is open to participants from different parts of the world, which creates an intercultural learning and teaching environment. By the end of this course, you should have a good idea of how these key global health challenges are approached by different stakeholders. You will have developed an understanding of what kind of solutions exist today and hopefully you will be curious as to how to make positive difference in the world.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=34677</url></Course><Course><course_id>34608</course_id><title>English for Doing Business in Asia – Speaking</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>4</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Sean McMinn, Delian Gaskell</instructor><school>School:  Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</school><description>The use of English for doing business in multinational settings is a fact of life for many business people. As Asian economies expand and become more involved in the global economy, a lingua franca – a language used to communicate among groups of people who do not share a mother tongue – is needed to exchange information. This course has two goals. The first is to introduce non-native speakers of English to methods for developing spoken English language and communication skills for doing business in Asia. The second is to examine the impact of interculturality and globalization on English communications. By exploring and participating in a business simulation set in Asia, you will develop the principal skills for effective communication in English when conducting business in China and other Asian countries.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=34608</url></Course><Course><course_id>48835</course_id><title>Foundations of Data Analysis - Part 2: Inferential Statistics</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>4</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Michael J. Mahometa</instructor><school>School:  The University of Texas at Austin</school><description>In the second part of a two part course, we’ll learn how to take data and use it to make reasonable and useful conclusions. You’ll learn the basics of statistical thinking – starting with an interesting question and some data. Then, we’ll apply the correct statistical tool to help answer our question of interest – using R and hands-on Labs. Finally, we’ll learn how to interpret our findings and develop a meaningful conclusion. In this second of a two part statistics course, we will cover basic Inferential Statistics – integrating ideas of Part 1. If you have a basic knowledge of Descriptive Statistics, this course is for you. We will learn how to sample data, examine both quantitative and categorical data with statistical techniques such as t-tests, chi-square, ANOVA, and Regression. Both parts of the course are intended to cover the same material as a typical introductory undergraduate statistics course, with an added twist of modeling. This course is also intentionally devised to be sequential, with each new piece building on the previous topics. Once completed, students should feel comfortable using basic statistical techniques to answer their own questions about their own data, using a widely available statistical software package (R). This course will consist of: Instructional videos for statistical concepts broken down into manageable topics. Guided questions to help your understanding of the topic. Weekly tutorial videos for using R. Scaffolded learning with Pre-Labs (using R), followed by Labs where we will answer specific questions using real-world datasets. Weekly wrap-up questions challenging both topic and application knowledge. Join us in learning how to look at the world around us. What are the questions? How can we answer them? And what do those answers tell us about the world we live in?</description><url>/enroll?course_id=48835</url></Course><Course><course_id>45508</course_id><title>Science in Art: The Chemistry of Art Materials and Conservation</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>4</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Henry DePhillips</instructor><school>School:  Trinity College</school><description>How do artists create visual effects? In order to create an artistic impression, artists select materials that allow image formation, and that lend color, emphasis, shape, and size to the object created. A scientist might follow up by asking, why those materials?  What characteristics do they have that allow them to embody the artist’s intent? How durable are they? Will they maintain the same qualities, both physical and aesthetic, they had when the work left the studio? Conservation science further notes that all materials deteriorate over time, and then asks a follow-up question: What physical interventions are possible to maintain, preserve and protect the work as the artist intended? Whatever is done to the art object, the result must be to make the work recognizable as the artist’s work or the result is a failure.   That is a key goal of this course: to understand, from a chemical point of view, how conservation protocols and the material aspects of an art work allow a better appreciation of an artwork and its creation, as well as confidence that it is the artist’s work. These are not new problems. According to Leonardo da Vinci, the study of art should include the following topics: A knowledge of materials The chemistry of colors The mathematics of composition The laws of perspective The illusions of chiaroscuro As the briefest study of Leonardo's life shows, he was clearly ahead of his time in wanting to understand the reasons for a vast array of natural and artificial phenomena. Even so, a thorough understanding of those subjects listed above still escapes us today – but, progress has been made and that progress is at once the subject matter and the goal of this course.

We can ask, what are the buildings or spaces saying? How do they say it? How does it all stitch together? In this architecture course you will learn how to “read” Rome, an ancient city, reborn in the fifteenth century and reshaped substantially in the following three centuries. You will discover how Renaissance and Baroque Rome’s urban form, art, and architecture projected the city’s image of itself to its citizens (urbi) and the world (orbi). Popes, architects, scholars and sculptors invested in Rome a variety of narratives that strove to explain the city’s history, convince its citizens and visitors of its harmony, and exhort society at large to share in and shape its destiny. The city that resulted became a destination for pilgrims and Grand Tourists, and still is today. The Meaning of Rome: The Renaissance and Baroque City is organized around three themes—the city and memory, the city as reliquary, and the city as theater. In uncovering some of the meaning of Rome, you will be equipped with the skills necessary to consider how our own cities and communities are, or could be, meaningful. You will come away from this course not only better informed about the cities of the past, but also better equipped to think about the cities of the present and the future. Students who successfully complete all of the required course assignments will have the opportunity to compile a Digication ePortfolio and earn a digital badge. </description><url>/enroll?course_id=51362</url></Course><Course><course_id>51485</course_id><title>Mastering Quantum Mechanics Part 2: Quantum Dynamics</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>3</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Saif Rayyan, Barton Zwiebach</instructor><school>School:  MIT</school><description>This physics course covers Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle and the concept of compatible operators. You will also learn about the Schrödinger and Heisenberg pictures of quantum mechanics and the coherent and squeezed states of the harmonic oscillator. The course concludes with two state systems and their applications to NMR and masers. This is the second of three courses offering a sophisticated view of quantum mechanics and its proper mathematical foundation. Part 1: Wave Mechanics Part 2: Quantum Dynamics Part 3: Entanglement and Angular Momentum To understand the material in this course you should have taken Mastering Quantum Mechanics Part 1: Wave Mechanics. Completing the 3-part Quantum Mechanics series will give you the necessary foundation to pursue advanced study or research at the graduate level in areas related to quantum mechanics The series will follow MIT’s on campus 8.05, the second semester of the three-course sequence on undergraduate quantum mechanics, and will be equally rigorous. 8.05 is a signature course in MIT's physics program and a keystone in the education of physics majors.    Learner Testimonials “I’ve thought long and hard to come up with a better MOOC than this one (I’ve completed 25 of these things over the past 2 years) and can’t do it. 8.05x is #1 and I suspect will stay that way for some time to come.”  “Being an engineering student from India trying to shift to Physics, I am often faced with the requirement to study topics on my own. Very often this has led me to feel inadequate. 8.05x was the perfect opportunity for me to both gain knowledge and evaluate my understanding on a high quality international platform. It has really exceeded my expectations. Now, at the end of fifteen weeks, I feel more confident and hopefully I am more knowledgeable.”</description><url>/enroll?course_id=51485</url></Course><Course><course_id>46957</course_id><title>Personal Finance Planning</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>3</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Sugato Chakravarty</instructor><school>School:  Purdue University</school><description>Have you ever watched the evening news and wondered what the anchor meant when she said: “…and the Dow closed 50 points in choppy trading today.”   Have you ever watched Mad Money on CNBC as the host screamed BUY BUY BUY or SELL SELL SELL and clapped your hands with his energy while having no clue what was happening?   Have you watched a movie where successful Wall Street characters dropped cool sounding financial jargon and you smiled and nodded without knowing what they were saying?   Have you ever had someone talk about Roth IRAs and 401Ks, and as you nodded, your heart was racing? Have you ever received multiple credit card solicitations in the mail and wondered which ones to sign up for or even if to sign up for any at all? If you answered yes to any (and maybe all) of the above then this class is for you. Want to better understand investments? How credit works? How and why insurance products like life insurance, health insurance, and property insurance might be relevant for you? How to maximize your retirement savings? This course aims to make finding the answers to these questions, and many other similar questions, interesting and fun. This personal finance course is divided into four modules: investments, credit, insurance and retirement. Each module is independent and may be studied on its own, although studying them together provides a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness across modules and the various tradeoffs across them. Throughout the course, we will explore interesting and relevant real world examples so that you can better understand the underlying concepts. We will also relate relevant academic research to the topic on hand and show how the research findings are relevant to your daily financial decisions. This course provides practical, ready-to-use solutions to use in your daily life. All solutions may not be equally important for you given your age and priorities, but they will certainly be relevant to you at some point in your life.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=46957</url></Course><Course><course_id>68066</course_id><title>Intellectual Property Law and Policy - Part 1: IP and Patent Laws</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>3</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  R.

Central to the account are the road to emancipation, the role of black soldiers, the nature of Abraham Lincoln’s wartime leadership, internal dissent in both the North and South, the changing position of women in both societies, and the war’s long-term economic and intellectual impact. We end with a look at the beginnings of Reconstruction during the conflict. This course is part of the XSeries, Civil War and Reconstruction, which introduces students to the most pivotal era in American history. The Civil War transformed the nation by eliminating the threat of secession and destroying the institution of slavery. It raised questions that remain central to our understanding of ourselves as a people and a nation – the balance of power between local and national authority, the boundaries of citizenship, and the meanings of freedom and equality. This XSeries will examine the causes of the war, the road to secession, the conduct of the Civil War, the coming of emancipation, and the struggle after the war to breathe meaning into the promise of freedom for four million emancipated slaves. One theme throughout the series is what might be called the politics of history – how the world in which a historian lives affects his or her view of the past, and how historical interpretations reinforce or challenge the social order of the present.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=23672</url></Course><Course><course_id>34819</course_id><title>A System View of Communications: From Signals to Packets (Part 1)</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>3</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Bertram Shi, Shenghui Song</instructor><school>School:  Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</school><description>Have you ever wondered how information is transmitted using your mobile phone or a WiFi hotspot?

We will talk about the role of forests for medicines and wild foods, as sources of fuelwood and charcoal for energy, and other pressing topics that confront sustainable forest management such as the impacts of human health and diseases on forests. The course consists of modules on forests and livelihoods in developing countries, agroforestry, human health in forested environments, protected areas and their sustainability, small and medium forest enterprises (SMFEs), and  community forestry. Three cross-cutting themes (gender, tenure and forest rights, and climate change) will span all of the modules. This course will engage you in developing a deeper understanding of the fundamental importance of forest resources in the lives and livelihoods of people in developing countries. Participants from tropical and developing countries may have lived much of what we will talk about in this course, and your experiences will deepen our understanding of the course material. Participants not from a developing country will gain a much better appreciation for the multitude of ways that people in developing countries use forest resources. Weekly videos will be complemented by readings, quizzes, and links to online resources to help you explore current scholarship in this domain. A discussion forum will enable you to delve more deeply into these issues with other participants and the course staff. The themes covered in this MOOC are important to anyone working in international forestry.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=35864</url></Course><Course><course_id>69965</course_id><title>Introduction to DevOps</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>3</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Lei Ma, Steven Borg</instructor><school>School:  Microsoft</school><description>DevOps is the union of people, process and products to enable the continuous delivery of value to end users.

How can open government data be made available to improve public policy making? Which technologies are available to make governments more open and  use open government data? Governments all over the world aim to become more open and transparent in order to establish closer ties with their constituents. However, releasing government data involves complex challenges and poses two major concerns. First, many different participants are involved and there are various dependencies between them, and second, the technologies that support open government are fragmented. In addition, it is unclear how different contexts should alter the best practices for open government. This course explores the foundations and objectives of Open Government and examines current developments, including the opening and reuse of governmental data such as the release of data by governments in America and Europe. This course will empower you by helping you grasp the key principles surrounding open government. The topics of the course are applied to concrete cases, which you will be asked to analyze and discuss with your peers. This course may be of interest to the following: Students interested in the basics of open government, in data-driven governance and data-driven research Professionals or researchers working on open government research and interested in strategies and challenges for opening governments Professionals or researchers working on open data research or open data initiatives Professionals and researchers working on topics related to public values, including transparency and privacy, in a governmental context Senior administrators, policy advisors, government officials or agency members, who are interested in how ICTs change governments and how ICTs can be used in public administrations   LICENSE The course materials of this course are Copyright Delft University of Technology and are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=50914</url></Course><Course><course_id>14146</course_id><title>Introduction to Human Evolution</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>2</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Adam Van Arsdale</instructor><school>School:  Wellesley College</school><description>As contemporary humans, we are a product of our evolutionary past. That past can be directly observed through the study of the human fossil record, the materials preserved for archaeological study, and the DNA of living and extinct human populations. This course will provide an overview of human evolutionary history from the present--contemporary human variation in a comparative context--through our last common ancestor with the living great apes, some 5-7 million years in the past. Emphasis will be placed on major evolutionary changes in the development of humans and the methodological approaches used by paleoanthropologists and related investigators to develop that knowledge. The course will begin by asking basic questions about how evolution operates to shape biological variation and what patterns of variation look like in living humans and apes. We will then look at how the human lineage first began to differentiate from apes, the rise and fall of the Australopithecines, the origin and dispersal of the genus Homo, and eventually the radical evolutionary changes associated with the development of agricultural practices in the past 15,000 years. Throughout the course students will be exposed to the primary data, places and theories that shape our understanding of human evolution.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=14146</url></Course><Course><course_id>24089</course_id><title>American Capitalism: A History</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>2</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Edward E. Baptist, Louis Hyman</instructor><school>School:  Cornell University</school><description>Perhaps no story is as essential to get right as the history of capitalism. Nearly all of our theories about promoting progress come from how we interpret the economic changes of the last 500 years. This past decade’s crises continue to remind us just how much capitalism changes, even as its basic features—wage labor, financial markets, private property, entrepreneurs—endure. While capitalism has a global history, the United States plays a special role in that story. This course will help you to understand how the United States became the world’s leading economic power, revealing essential lessons about what has been and what will be possible in capitalism’s on-going revolution. FAQ Do I need to have taken economics before? No. Though there will be discussion of economic ideas, professors will assume no prior economic training. I am not familiar with American history, but I am interested in how capitalism works. Can I take this course? Yes. We will have relevant links to helpful background material for each section that should make it possible for those with no knowledge of U.S. history to take the class. Is this class about economic thought like Smith, Marx, Ricardo, Hayek, etc.? This class is primarily about what actually happened rather than theories of what happened. While we will touch on important economic thinkers, this class will focus more on the people and institutions that developed capitalism in the United States. If you want to know how capitalism works and came about, this is the class for you. Will certificates be awarded? Yes. If you complete the work and achieve a passing grade in the course, you can earn a Honor Code Certificate, which indicates that you have completed the course successfully. Certificates will be issued by edX under the name of CornellX, designating the institution from which the course originated. What will help me complete this course? We have found that the best help you can get is other people in the real world. Enlist friends, co-workers, family, and other people to take the class with you. Ask your friends on Facebook or Twitter. Arrange a time during a lunch break or an evening to discuss the week’s videos and readings. Think of this “MOOC club” like a book club! You will get more out of the material and be much more likely to finish. I want to read more about American Capitalism! Professors Baptist and Hyman just wrote a course reader expressly for this MOOC (though it is also being taught at Cornell University). Containing every reading from the MOOC, as well as additional readings from leading scholars (that could not be had for free!), this course reader provides the student with more background for every topic. Each reading is introduced and discussed by the professors. Each reading, as well, has additional questions for the student to discuss with their friends. Are there prerequisites? This course is designed to be accessible for people without a strong background in U.S. history. Nevertheless, we make reference to many people, locations, events, or developments that may be unfamiliar to some students. Below are sources for additional information. Wikipedia is a very helpful source for a quick definition or description of most of the material in this course. It can help you answer most factual questions you might have. Digital History is a website that can serve as an online text book if you need a stronger grounding in U.S. history. For more difficult questions, you can post a question on the discussion board where your fellow students may be able to help you. An e-book has been designed for this class, containing all the readings and some additional essays by leading scholars in the history of capitalism, including the professors.

During this process of change, the capital of a military empire that once invaded East Asia experienced occupation by the U.S. armed forces, hosted the Olympic Games, and transformed into a consumer hub where young people could enjoy economic “wealth.” It is important to know that this process was recorded in countless photographs, documentary films, TV programs, and so on. We will retrieve many of these archived pictures and videos and analyze what happened in postwar Tokyo from different perspectives. In Part 1, you will look at the changes that occurred in postwar Tokyo over a quarter of a century from four different perspectives: 1) occupation and Americanism; 2) imperial gaze and royal wedding; 3) The Olympic city; and 4) economic-cultural clash in Shinjuku. This examination of urban history will provide you with the insights necessary when considering changes in other large cities in Asia, such as Seoul, Beijing, and Bangkok, at the end of the twentieth century.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=34836</url></Course><Course><course_id>45331</course_id><title>Introduction to Data Wise: A Collaborative Process to Improve Learning &amp; Teaching</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>2</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Kathryn Parker Boudett</instructor><school>School:  Harvard University</school><description>Educators have an ever-increasing stream of data at their fingertips, but knowing how to use this data to improve learning and teaching — how to make it less overwhelming, more useful, and part of an effective collaborative process — can be challenging.   Based on the book Data Wise: A Step-by-Step Guide to Using Assessment Results to Improve Teaching and Learning, this course describes a clear, 8-step process for using a wide range of data sources to improve instruction.

Medieval liturgy, however, took up many hours of every day, filled the city's largest meeting halls, and even spilled onto the streets. At the center of the medieval liturgy were the books we will study in this course. In this module of The Book: Histories Across Time and Space, we’ll explore and explain the beautiful service books of the medieval church. No prior knowledge of liturgy or Latin is required, but there will be a lot of both, along with music. The medieval services consisted of a complex system of cycles, and the liturgical books correspond to the various functions of the people who used them: Laypersons, nuns and monks, readers, singers, priests, and bishops. We will explore and examine these precious objects using materials from Harvard’s collections. Close examination of various types of books will help to explain the complex and collaborative nature of medieval worship. Ultimately, we will learn how these beautifully adorned books  represent the importance of liturgy as an essential function of society in the Middle Ages.

American Icons – from the Star Spangled Banner to the Statue of Liberty – how have these become iconic symbols for Americans?  What do these icons represent in a global context? Rights and Liberties – from the Declaration of Independence to the Greensboro Lunch Counter, how have Americans defined, and continue to define, their rights and governance? America the Beautiful – From evidence of the continent’s first inhabitants to the conservation efforts of the Smithsonian’s scientists, how have the American people – both native and settler – envisioned, explored, worked and protected the land and its resources? Spirit of Invention – from the Model T to the space program, how have America’s pioneering inventions changed the world? In this course you will gain a unique perspective on American history and culture by learning the stories behind objects that were, and continue to be, an essential part of U.S. history. Most importantly, you will reflect on what objects have personal meaning to you, and the role that symbolic objects play in your own histories.

Tout individu est un jour ou l’autre amené à épargner ou emprunter. La sélection des projets d’investissements et leur financement sont des questions cruciales pour les entrepreneurs ou managers. D’une manière plus large, les décisions prises par le monde politique en matières financières influencent directement ou indirectement le quotidien des citoyens. Les récentes crises financières ont pu nous montrer à quel point il peut être primordial de comprendre les fondamentaux de la finance. Sans un minimum d’éducation financière, il est difficile d’appréhender le fonctionnement du monde dans lequel nous évoluons. Ce cours introductif vous propose un cadre conceptuel et des outils pour vous aider à prendre des décisions financières judicieuses, avec un focus particulier sur les opérations financières courantes.      Au terme de ce cours, vous serez capable de : Décrire les principes fondamentaux du raisonnement financier : absence d’opportunités d’arbitrage dans un marché concurrentiel, intégration de la dimension temporelle et du risque dans la décision financière ; Calculer des valeurs actuelles ou futures, de flux ou de séquence de flux ; Appliquer les techniques de l’évaluation actuarielle aux opérations financières courantes (de type épargne ou emprunt) et aux principaux actifs financiers (actions et obligations) ; Utiliser les différents outils de sélection d’investissement pour des projets en entreprise ; Analyser la problématique de la décision d’investissement, en tenant compte du lien entre rendement attendu et risque ; Déterminer le taux de rendement qu’une entreprise doit utiliser lorsqu’elle doit prendre une décision d’investissement et utiliser ce taux pour calculer la valeur générée par un projet ; Suivre des cours de finance plus avancés (finance d’entreprise, gestion de portefeuille, marchés financiers, finance internationale, produits dérivés, etc.). Financial decisions impact all of us. As individuals we earn money, spend it, borrow it and at times save and invest it. At work, for managers or entrepreneurs, financial decisions are crucial. In the public sector , financial decisions made by politicians affect us every day. Without minimal financial literacy, it is very difficult to succeed, especially in light of the recent financial crises. This introductory course provides a framework and tools to help you make sound financial decisions, with a particular focus on common financial operations. At the end of this course, you will be able to: Describe the basics of financial reasoning: absence of arbitrage opportunity in a competitive market, decision-making based on both time and risk ; Calculate present or future values of cash-flows or sequences of cash-flows ; Apply the principles of valuation to value common financial operations (savings or loans) and main financial assets (stocks and bonds); Use different criteria to select investment projects in firms ;  Analyze capital budgeting problems, involving the relationship between expected return and risk ; Determine the return a firm should use when facing an investment decision, and use this return to compute the value generated by a project ;  Take more advanced courses in finance (corporate finance, portfolio management, financial markets, international finance, derivative securities, etc.).   Ce cours est enseigné en français.

Natural disasters like this one can be seen throughout our Earth’s history. They will continue to prey on all regions, bringing devastation when they strike. But are we so powerless? What if we could improve preparedness over the world and limit the devastation caused by coastal disasters? These are the questions we at Waseda University have been asking. Now we would like to share our experiences and achievements in disaster prevention with the rest of the world. In this environmental studies course, you will learn about coastal disasters. Using worldwide field surveys, you will develop an understanding of the nature of tsunamis and storm surges. You will learn how coastal areas are attacked, understand how human lives are lost and infrastructure destroyed. Using numerical simulations and hydraulic experiments, we will present you with different scenarios, teaching you about the mechanisms behind a coastal disaster. You will look at successful coastal disaster prevention concepts and methods. This will include defenses such as coastal dikes, as well as the implementation of essential evacuation plans. Ultimately, you will learn how to reduce the effects of coastal disasters and how to protect yourself and others if a disaster strikes. Whether you are an emergency management official, a city developer, an engineering student, or living in a potential natural coastal disaster community, this environmental studies course will teach you how we can improve disaster preparedness and management throughout the world.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=50068</url></Course><Course><course_id>46935</course_id><title>Evolution of the Human Sociality: A Quest for the Origin of Our Social Behavior</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>1</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Juichi Yamagiwa, Shun Hongo</instructor><school>School:  Kyoto University</school><description>Through the process of evolution, animals have developed their biological features and their cultures based on their surrounding environments. How we live our lives today is a direct result of features developed from our primate ancestors as they adapted to new environments. In primatology, it is essential to think about how cultural development and biological natures are inseparable. This course will help you rediscover the process of evolution and will introduce primatological studies conducted by researchers at Kyoto University, Japan. Based on carefully conducted research on primate species, we will explore the origins of human beings and provide you with examples of common similarities between human beings and non-human primates. We will analyze basic features, such as foraging, mating, aggression, and communication from the primatological viewpoint. Furthermore, cultural and social aspects of human society, from the formation of family groups to community activities, will be considered thoroughly, in comparison to those of monkeys and apes. Our goal is to broaden your view of humans to a wider extent and think dynamically about your biology in terms of human evolution. Through acquiring knowledge of basic primatology in this course, you will establish a viewpoint to think and discuss the evolutionary process of human, and human society, in conjunction with those of our close relatives. No previous academic knowledge is required.

Through better use of data, leaders are able to plan and enact strategies with greater clarity and confidence. Data drives increased organizational efficiency and a competitive advantage. Simply, analytics provide new insight and actionable intelligence. In education, the use of data and analytics to improve learning is referred to as learning analytics. Analytics have not yet made the impact on education that they have made in other fields. That’s starting to change. Software companies, researchers, educators, and university leaders recognize the value of data in improving not only teaching and learning, but the entire education sector. In particular, learning analytics enables universities, schools, and corporate training departments to improve the quality of learning and overall competitiveness. Research communities such as the International Educational Data Mining Society (IEDMS) and the Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR) are developing promising models for improving learner success through predictive analytics, machine learning, recommender systems (content and social), network analysis, tracking the development of concepts through social systems, discourse analysis, and intervention and support strategies. The era of data and analytics in learning is just beginning. Data, Analytics, and Learning provides an introduction to learning analytics and how it is being deployed in various contexts in education, including to support automated intervention, to inform instructors, and to promote scientific discovery. Additionally, we will discuss tools and methods, what skills data scientists need in education, and how to protect student privacy and other rights. The course will provide a broad overview of the field, suitable for a broad audience. Learners will explore the logic of analytics, the basics of finding, cleaning, and using educational data, predictive models, text analysis, and activity graphs and social networks. We will discuss use of analytics in data domains such as log files and text data.  Tableau Software is partnering with University of Texas Arlington to provide analytics software to course participants as well as technical support and guest lectures. Additional software will be introduced and discussed throughout the course. How this course works: This course will experiment with multiple learning pathways.

Students are welcome to audit the course, and participate in all course activities. Certificates will not be issued. Many early childhood educators report feeling ill equipped to meet the needs of children with challenging behavior and frustrated in their attempts to develop safe and nurturing early learning environment. If you work with young children, you are not alone in your feelings! Increasing evidence suggests that an effective approach to addressing problem behavior is the adoption of a model that focuses on promoting social-emotional development, providing support for children’s appropriate behavior, and preventing challenging behavior. In this class, you will learn a framework for addressing the social and emotional development and challenging behavior of young children. The overarching goal of this course is to learn evidence-based practices to support the social and emotional development of infants and young children. We will read current research on the developmental trajectory of children with early-onset aggressive behaviors; positive behavior support program models; and intervention efforts that promote positive early childhood mental health. Evidence-based classroom management skills will also be studied and you will leave the course with a solid understanding of how to design supportive environments. This course incorporates a community with which you can learn from others, share your own current approaches and discuss your attempts to incorporate the learnings of this course into your early childhood practice.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=19818</url></Course><Course><course_id>41556</course_id><title>"A Study in Scarlet" by Doyle: BerkeleyX Book Club</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>1</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Maggie Sokolik</instructor><school>School:  Berkeley</school><description>This literature course will explore A Study in Scarlet, an 1887 detective mystery novel by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. This novel introduced the iconic Sherlock Holmes and his friend Dr. John Watson. The book's title comes from a speech Holmes gives to Doctor Watson about his work, saying: "There's the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it." The story received little very public interest when it first appeared. In fact, only eleven complete copies of Beeton's Christmas Annual 1887 are known to exist. Many adaptations of Sherlock Holmes exist, however, and he continues to fascinate readers as an enigmatic detective. Participants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion. Course materials will include background information for understanding the text, as well as vocabulary and language support. Assessment will include quizzes and short writing assignments.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=41556</url></Course><Course><course_id>34824</course_id><title>"Dubliners" by Joyce: BerkeleyX Book Club</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>1</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Maggie Sokolik</instructor><school>School:  Berkeley</school><description>This literature course will examine James Joyce’s collection of fifteen short stories called simply Dubliners. This volume was first published in 1914, but not without a struggle. Joyce first submitted these stories to a publisher in 1905, and had it rejected 17 times before it was finally published in 1914. It has become one of the classics of English language literature, despite its rocky beginnings. Dubliners depicts middle class Irish life in the early part of the 20th century. The first stories are narrated by protagonists who are children. As the stories continue, they examine the lives of characters in increasingly older stages of life. Interestingly, many of the characters who appear in these short stories appear later in minor roles in Joyce’s famous novel Ulysses.   Participants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion. Course materials will include background information for understanding the text, as well as vocabulary and language support.

Arm yourself with the essential principles and practices of marketing in the digital economy by making this course, taught by Internet consumer shopping expert and Wharton professor David Bell, an indispensable part of your knowledge base. In this business and management course, you will gain an understanding of how the digital economy works and develop the critical insights necessary to succeed in e-commerce and digital and social media marketing. The fixed and mobile Internet and related technologies exert a profound influence on how business and social institutions evolve, how they are challenged—and sometimes, even displaced. Companies that were non-existent a few short years ago, including Facebook, LinkedIn, and Uber, have dramatically changed how we interact, communicate and get from point A to B. Even Amazon and Google are relatively “young” by any measure. If you’re an entrepreneur, investor, manager, or student, you need thoughtful approaches to navigate and win in this new environment. This course is organized around four broad themes and we will use relevant theory and analysis, as well as numerous practical examples to develop our key learning points. The themes are: Behavioral foundations for understanding and navigating the new online-offline landscape New forms of interaction, including formation of networks and reputation building Tools and principles of digital marketing action including online advertising on fixed and mobile devices New media platforms and emergence of “organic” celebrities and communities This course is beneficial to marketing professionals, analysts, entrepreneurs, small business owners, investors, and consumers This course evolved from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School’s very first course on digital marketing and e-commerce.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=65211</url></Course><Course><course_id>6826</course_id><title>Introduction to Aeronautical Engineering</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>8</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Jacco M.

What impact should animal rights have on your decision? Is the suffering involved in meat, egg and dairy production bad enough that you should go vegan? How do your food choices affect the economy and the environment? Should you become a locavore? Should you eat only sustainably produced, "farm to table" food? Or is factory-farmed food more efficient and ultimately better for the environment? We also face difficult food-related questions at the political-social level. Should states restrict their citizens' food choices so as to encourage healthy eating? Should governments grant patents on genetically modified crops? And how do we, as a society, implement effective food policies for a rapidly expanding world population? This class will provide the tools required to reflect clearly and effectively on these challenging questions. Our goal is to provide a working understanding of some leading ethical theories as well as the central empirical issues related to food production, distribution and consumption.

We cover the three main programming paradigms: functional, object-oriented, and declarative dataflow. The two courses are targeted toward people with a basic knowledge of programming. It will be most useful to beginning programming students, but the unconventional approach should be insightful even to seasoned professionals. Louv1.1x covers fundamental concepts. You’ll learn functional programming, its techniques and its data structures. You’ll use simple formal semantics for all concepts, and see those concepts illustrated with practical code that runs on the accompanying open-source platform, the Mozart Programming System. Louv1.2x covers data abstraction, state, and concurrency. You’ll learn the four ways to do data abstraction and discuss the trade-offs between objects and abstract data types. You’ll be exposed to deterministic dataflow, the most useful paradigm for concurrent programming, and learn how it avoids race conditions.

The questions we will take up include: Is extreme poverty a thing of the past? What is economic life like when living under a dollar per day? Are the poor always hungry? How do we make schools work for poor citizens? How do we deal with the disease burden? Is microfinance invaluable or overrated? Without property rights, is life destined to be "nasty, brutish and short"? Should we leave economic development to the market? Should we leave economic development to non-governmental organizations (NGOs)? Does foreign aid help or hinder? Where is the best place to intervene? And many others. At the end of this course, you should have a good sense of the key questions asked by scholars interested in poverty today, and hopefully a few answers as well. How does this course use videos? Do I need to watch the lectures live? Various videos will be released each week including lecture sequences on the topic for that week, special interview videos with leading economists, and supplementary videos for reviewing topics in economics and statistics. You can watch these at your leisure once they come available each week, though we encourage you to keep up with the pace of the course. Will the text of the lectures be available?

Gibson</instructor><school>School:  MIT</school><description>All around us, engineers are creating materials whose properties are exactly tailored to their purpose. This course is the first of three in a series of mechanics courses from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at MIT. Taken together, these courses provide similar content to the MIT subject 3.032: Mechanical Behavior of Materials. The 3.032x series provides an introduction to the mechanical behavior of materials, from both the continuum and atomistic points of view. At the continuum level, we learn how forces and displacements translate into stress and strain distributions within the material. At the atomistic level, we learn the mechanisms that control the mechanical properties of materials.  Examples are drawn from metals, ceramics, glasses, polymers, biomaterials, composites and cellular materials. Part 1 covers stress-strain behavior, topics in linear elasticity and the atomic basis for linear elasticity, and composite materials. Part 2 covers stress transformations, beam bending, column buckling, and cellular materials. Part 3 covers viscoelasticity (behavior intermediate to that of an elastic solid and that of a viscous fluid), plasticity (permanent deformation), creep in crystalline materials (time dependent behavior), brittle fracture (rapid crack propagation) and fatigue (failure due to repeated loading of a material).  </description><url>/enroll?course_id=47048</url></Course><Course><course_id>132</course_id><title>Health in Numbers: Quantitative Methods in Clinical &amp; Public Health Research</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>7</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Earl Francis Cook, Marcello Pagano</instructor><school>School:  Harvard University</school><description>Quantitative Methods in Clinical and Public Health Research is the online adaptation of material from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health's classes in epidemiology and biostatistics. Principled investigations to monitor and thus improve the health of individuals are firmly based on a sound understanding of modern quantitative methods. This involves the ability to discover patterns and extract knowledge from health data on a sample of individuals and then to infer, with measured uncertainty, the unobserved population characteristics. This course will address this need by covering the principles of biostatistics and epidemiology used for public health and clinical research. These include outcomes measurement, measures of associations between outcomes and their determinants, study design options, bias and confounding, probability and diagnostic tests, confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, power and sample size determinations, life tables and survival methods, regression methods (both, linear and logistic), and sample survey techniques. Students will analyze sample data sets to acquire knowledge of appropriate computer software. By the end of the course the successful student should have attained a sound understanding of these methods and a solid foundation for further study.   FAQ How much does it cost to take the course? Nothing! The course is free. When will assignments be due? The course is organized into weeks, and each week will have its own set of assignments. Students will be expected to complete their homework each week. Do I need any other materials to take the course? Nope, as long as you’ve got a Mac or PC, you’ll be ready to take the course. Will the course use any textbooks or software? Yes! We'll have free access to the book "Principles of Biostatistics" written by Marcello Pagano (one of the Professors) and Kimberlee Gauvreau. In addition to the textbook, we'll use Stata (a piece of software for doing statistical analysis). Thanks to our friends at Statacorp, we'll have free copies of Stata available for all students to use for the duration of the course (Mac and PC only). Do I need to watch the lectures live?

Students are welcome to audit the course, and participate in all course activities. Certificates will not be issued. This course is designed to help you become a more effective and confident public speaker. We will demystify the process of writing, practicing, and performing a clear and engaging speech, work through the unique traits of oral versus written communication, and learn how to prepare speeches that are easier to deliver orally and understand aurally. One of the best ways to refine your own speech ability is through a close study of others' speeches. We will have a number of opportunities to examine and discuss sample speeches and speakers. Growing out of our analysis of speakers, we will discuss who you hold up as a model speaker and analyze what makes that speaker effective. We will critically examine our own speeches and the speeches of others. By becoming a student of public speaking, you join a long history of rhetorical study dating back to ancient Greece.

Un tiempo, entre los siglos XVI y XVII, en el que su sociedad alcanzó la excelencia en las artes y las letras. Aunque ese esplendor se dio en plenos aires de cambio. Pues España pasó de la hegemonía a la decadencia, de la expansión a la crisis. Esta asignatura pretende trazar la historia de aquella época. Entre el Renacimiento y el Barroco su cultura marcó la pauta en Occidente. Las obras literarias -La Celestina, El Lazarillo, etc.- se tradujeron enseguida en las imprentas europeas y americanas. Las ropas marcaron la moda cortesana. La tendencia más fashion era “vestir a la española”. Los tratados militares y políticos fueron estudiados por los enemigos. La acumulación de talentos en la Villa y Corte de Madrid (Cervantes, Lope, Velázquez, etc.), tuvo réplicas en las grandes ciudades de imperio. Pues en Sevilla, Lisboa, Barcelona, Nápoles, México o Lima se multiplicaron academias literarias, estrenos teatrales y fiestas. Una síntesis de pueblos unidos por la lealtad a la Corona y la fe católica. En nuestro recorrido por esa España de El Quijote pasaremos de la campana al reloj y de la geografía fantástica a la real. La sociedad estuvo - Conocer la Historia de España en el Siglo de Oro a través de El Quijote como hilo conductor. Adentrarnos en la vida cotidiana de los siglos XVI y XVII a través de la sociedad y la cultura. Ofrecer al alumnado las fuentes escritas y visuales para que contemple el tiempo de El Quijote como si viviese en él. Comparar los valores de la España de El Quijote con los actuales para comprender cómo han ido evolucionando a lo largo de la Historia polarizada entre los privilegiados -nobleza y clero- y los pobres y los picaros. El Humanismo fue cultivado en las universidades. La familia, la alimentación, la vivienda, los juegos y las fiestas, protagonizaron la vida cotidiana.  En el tiempo de El Quijote las luces de los genios literarios y artísticos brillaron sobre las sombras de la Inquisición. Viajemos, pues, a esta excelsa cultura del Siglo de Oro.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=34705</url></Course><Course><course_id>40029</course_id><title>eHealth – Opportunities and Challenges</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>7</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Sabine Koch, Maria Hägglund, Sara Riggare</instructor><school>School:  KIx: Karolinska Institutet</school><description>KIeHealthX will introduce students to the field of eHealth and its opportunities and challenges.

This novel was first published as a serial novel in Lippincott’s Monthly Magazine in 1890. The Picture of Dorian Gray was immediately controversial, and was censored by the magazine’s editors. Even with the censorship, reviewers still thought that Wilde ought to have been prosecuted for violating laws concerning public morality. This story has two important themes: the idea of selling one’s soul, and the theme of living a double life. Wilde takes these themes to their extreme.   Participants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion.

The Comedy, which is richly steeped in the medieval culture of the 14th century, still speaks vividly to modern readers struggling with the question, “who am I?” Dante, as a Florentine, a poet, a lover, and religious believer, struggled with the same question in each facet of his life before coming to a moment of vision that wholly transformed him as a person. As a 21st century reader, you will encounter the poem in a novel online environment that integrates knowledge from the disciplines of literature, history, psychology, philosophy, and theology with modern technology. You will be guided through the poem by means of the "MyDante" Project, an online environment developed by Professor Ambrosio in collaboration with the Georgetown University Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship (CNDLS), which will aid your own contemplative engagement with the poem. Alone and with the edX community, you will reflect on both Dante's interpretation of freedom and how it functions in the formation of personal identity, and the problem of finding appropriate metaphors to discuss these issues in our modern life. You, the modern reader, will only understand the full implications of Dante's poetry if you participate with it in a way that is personal and is genuinely contemplative. You will discover that contemplative reading goes beyond the literal meaning, and even beyond the traditional allegorical and interpreted meaning, to apply every possible meaning contained in the text to your own life and identity. Through the MyDante platform, you will learn to know yourself in your own historical, personal, and spiritual contexts as you journey towards your understanding of your personal freedom and identity.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=65198</url></Course><Course><course_id>51483</course_id><title>Mastering Quantum Mechanics Part 1: Wave Mechanics</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>2</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Saif Rayyan, Barton Zwiebach</instructor><school>School:  MIT</school><description>This physics course offers a sophisticated view of quantum mechanics and its proper mathematical foundation. In this first module of three you will review the basics of wave mechanics and be introduced to the variational principle. You will learn about the technology of spin one-half states and spin operators and get an in-depth look into linear algebra to establish the mathematical foundation necessary to do quantum mechanics. This course concludes by developing the bra-ket notation of Dirac. To follow this course you will need some basic familiarity with quantum mechanics. You must have seen the Schrödinger equation and studied its solutions for the square well potential, the harmonic oscillator, and the hydrogen atom. You must be proficient in calculus and have some knowledge of linear algebra. Completing the 3-part Mastering Quantum Mechanics series will give you the necessary foundation to pursue advanced study or research at the graduate level in areas related to quantum mechanics. Part 1: Wave Mechanics, Part 2: Quantum Dynamics Part 3: Entanglement, and Angular Momentum. The series will follow MIT’s on campus 8.05, the second semester of the three-course sequence on undergraduate quantum mechanics, and will be equally rigorous. 8.05 is a signature course in MIT's physics program and a keystone in the education of physics majors.    Learner Testimonial “I’ve thought long and hard to come up with a better MOOC than this one (I’ve completed 25 of these things over the past 2 years) and can’t do it. 8.05x is #1 and I suspect will stay that way for some time to come.”  “Being an engineering student from India trying to shift to Physics, I am often faced with the requirement to study topics on my own. Very often this has led me to feel inadequate. 8.05x was the perfect opportunity for me to both gain knowledge and evaluate my understanding on a high quality international platform. It has really exceeded my expectations. Now, at the end of fifteen weeks, I feel more confident and hopefully I am more knowledgeable.”</description><url>/enroll?course_id=51483</url></Course><Course><course_id>48080</course_id><title>À la découverte du théâtre classique français – Tome 1</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>2</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Georges Forestier</instructor><school>School:  Sorbonne University System</school><description>Le théâtre classique du 17e siècle passe pour le sommet de l’art du théâtre en France. Ses trois représentants les plus connus, Corneille et Racine pour la tragédie et Molière pour la comédie comptent parmi les plus grands dramaturges européens de tous les temps, et Molière reste l’un des auteurs les plus joués dans le monde. Pour vous les faire découvrir, nous vous emmènerons dans l’environnement historique, sociologique, culturel et littéraire qui les a vu naître. Nous retracerons ainsi l’histoire du "théâtre moderne" depuis sa naissance au milieu du 16e siècle jusqu’aux plus brillantes années du "siècle de Louis XIV"(2e moitié du 17e siècle). Nous examinerons ainsi les fondements de l’expression "théâtre classique," les fondements du système qui a vu naître les "règles classiques," les fondements d’un dialogue théâtral qui repose entièrement sur "l’alexandrin classique." Et nous ferons apparaître les tensions créatrices (entre la théorie et la pratique, entre les règles et le refus des règles, entre le texte et le spectacle, entre le classicisme et le baroque, entre la tragédie et l’opéra) qui ont façonné le théâtre de cette période. Enfin, en vous accompagnant dans la lecture des quelques chefs-d’œuvre qui ont créé une rupture esthétique et marqué les esprits, nous vous ferons pénétrer avec nous dans l’atelier créateur des plus grands dramaturges de l’âge d’or du théâtre français. Pièces de théâtre à lire: Le Cid et Cinna de Corneille / Les Précieuses ridicules, L’École des femmes et Tartuffe de Molière / Andromaque et Phèdre de Racine. Ces textes sont tous disponibles en éditions de poche (choisir de préférence "Folio classique” et "Folio Théâtre" ou "Le Livre de poche Classique.")  Nous vous invitons à découvrir avec nous d’où viennent ces trois auteurs, comment ils se sont construits, comment ils se sont distingués des plus brillants dramaturges de leur temps. Et nous vous montrerons quels sont les ingrédients qui ont permis à leurs œuvres d’avoir été sans cesse lues et jouées jusqu’à aujourd’hui — et cela, alors même que de nombreux éléments-clés (l’obéissance à des "règles" et l’usage du vers dit "alexandrin," en particulier) ont disparu depuis longtemps.    </description><url>/enroll?course_id=48080</url></Course><Course><course_id>46960</course_id><title>Architecting Microsoft Azure Solutions</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>2</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Sidney Andrews, Cale Teeter, Mark Grimes, Rob Boucher, Pete Harris</instructor><school>School:  Microsoft</school><description>Azure is Microsoft’s cloud computing platform, a growing collection of integrated services—analytics, computing, database, mobile, networking, storage, and web—for moving faster, achieving more, and saving money.

Around the world, people who are fed up with environmental degradation and the breakdown of their communities come together to transform blighted vacant lots, trashed-out stream corridors, polluted estuaries, and other “broken places.” Civic ecology practices—such as community gardening, wetlands restoration, river cleanups, and tree planting—are a means for people to express resilience and rebuild communities marked by disaster and disinvestment. Civic ecology draws on psychology, sociology, political science, education, ecology, and social-ecological systems resilience to understand how and why people care for nature and their communities. Throughout this course, you will: Explore the people, places, and practices that restore nature and revitalize neighborhoods, making a difference in ways big and small. Discuss and evaluate contemporary thinking in resilience, social-ecological systems, and the relationship between nature and human/community wellbeing. Grasp an understanding of how civic ecology enables those with limited resources to defy and cope with daily struggles, including after disaster and war. Acquire the knowledge and skill set to enact change in your own community. Participate in a civic ecology service learning project to turn classroom learning into real-life application. This course is ideal for a learner who is intrigued by both social and environmental concerns, or simply has a desire to dive into an emerging 21st century, cross-disciplinary subject area. You will complete this course with a keener awareness of social-ecological issues and concerns, as well as a greater knowledge of the practical steps required to rebuild and maintain community and nature in a world marked by inequality, conflict, and climate change.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=28809</url></Course><Course><course_id>34441</course_id><title>MyCS: Computer Science for Beginners</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>2</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Zachary Dodds</instructor><school>School:  Harvey Mudd College</school><description>How do computers work?

Of these manuscripts from the middle ages, only a small percentage have been identified, much less edited and published. To explore these fascinating texts, you need to learn the art and science of reading medieval handwriting. This module of The Book: Histories Across Space and Time introduces students to medieval paleography, the science of reading old handwriting, with a focus on the era of the 12th century. By studying a representative hand in depth, you will learn to read 12th century Transitional Gothic script and decipher the abbreviations that set the pattern of writing for the following centuries before print. We will work with selected manuscripts from Harvard’s Houghton library and enter into the cultural world of the 12th century monasteries and schools. Assessments and quizzes will allow you to track your progress as you move through letter forms and abbreviations to read whole blocks of text. Some knowledge of Latin will be very helpful for understanding the texts you will read, but students without the necessary language skills will still enjoy this chance to explore 12th century hands.

Gibson</instructor><school>School:  MIT</school><description>All around us, engineers are creating materials whose properties are exactly tailored to their purpose. This course is the third of three in a series of mechanics courses from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at MIT. Taken together, these courses provide similar content to the MIT subject 3.032: Mechanical Behavior of Materials. The 3.032x series provides an introduction to the mechanical behavior of materials, from both the continuum and atomistic points of view. At the continuum level, we learn how forces and displacements translate into stress and strain distributions within the material. At the atomistic level, we learn the mechanisms that control the mechanical properties of materials.  Examples are drawn from metals, ceramics, glasses, polymers, biomaterials, composites and cellular materials. Part 3 covers viscoelasticity (behavior intermediate to that of an elastic solid and that of a viscous fluid), plasticity (permanent deformation), creep in crystalline materials (time dependent behavior), brittle fracture (rapid crack propagation) and fatigue (failure due to repeated loading of a material).</description><url>/enroll?course_id=47060</url></Course><Course><course_id>69855</course_id><title>Circuits and Electronics 2: Amplification, Speed, and Delay</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>2</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Anant Agarwal, Chris Terman, Gerald Sussman, Piotr Mitros, Bonnie Lam</instructor><school>School:  MIT</school><description>Want to learn how to construct an amplifier for mobile phones?

Ou simplement pour la beauté de la matière? Alors ce cours est fait pour vous! Outre remplir le rôle d'outil dans les différentes branches mentionnées ci-dessus (permettant la résolution de problèmes concrets), l'algèbre linéaire, qui capture l'essence des mathématiques -à savoir, l'algèbre et la géométrie- vous introduira au monde plus abstrait des mathématiques. Proposé comme complément de cours aux ingénieurs de première année à l'Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, ce MOOC (composé de trois parties) n'en est pas moins un cours à part entière et peut être considéré comme une base solide d'algèbre linéaire pour tout étudiant intéressé par l'apprentissage de cette matière. Bien que les vidéos constituent le coeur du cours, des exercices de type QCM (Questions à choix multiples) ainsi que des séries au format PDF seront disponibles chaque semaine, ainsi que des corrigés appropriés. Plus précisément, les séries d'exercices seront accompagnées d'un corrigé au format PDF et certains problèmes bénéficieront d'une correction détaillée en vidéo, dans laquelle l'un des enseignants présentera la solution, étape par étape. Finalement, chaque vidéo de cours sera suivie d'un quiz, dont le but est de tester le degré d’assimilation des connaissances acquises. Le cours est organisé en dix chapitres dans lesquels une approche très détaillée des concepts théoriques est proposée, ainsi que de multiples exemples illustratifs : 1) Systèmes d'équations linéaires. 2) Algèbre matricielle. 3) Espaces vectoriels. 4) Bases et dimensions. 5) Applications linéaires.    6) Matrices et applications linéaires. 7) Déterminants. 8) Vecteurs propres, valeurs propres, diagonalisation. 9) Produits scalaires et espaces euclidiens. 10) Matrices orthogonales et matrices symétriques. Cette première partie du cours sera dévouée à l'étude des quatre premiers chapitres cités plus haut. Aucune connaissance particulière n’est requise pour comprendre les concepts abordés dans ce MOOC, mais il est conseillé de travailler régulièrement et de manière assidue, de façon à ne pas prendre de retard lors de l'apprentissage de la matière.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=46934</url></Course><Course><course_id>34566</course_id><title>An Introduction to Credit Risk Management</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>2</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Pasquale Cirillo</instructor><school>School:  Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)</school><description>Imagine that you are a bank and a main part of your daily business is to lend money. Unfortunately, lending money is a risky business - there is no 100% guarantee that you will get all your money back. If the borrower defaults, you will face losses in your portfolio. Or, in a bit less extreme scenario, if the credit quality of your counterparty deteriorates according to some rating system, the loan will become more risky. These are typical situations in which credit risk manifests itself. According to the Basel Accord, a global regulation framework for financial institutions, credit risk is one of the three fundamental risks a bank or any other regulated financial institution has to face when operating in the markets (the two other risks being market risk and operational risk). As the 2008 financial crisis has shown us, a correct understanding of credit risk and the ability to manage it are fundamental in today’s world. This course offers you an introduction to credit risk modelling and hedging. We will approach credit risk from the point of view of banks, but most of the tools and models we will overview can be beneficial at the corporate level as well. At the end of the course, you will be able to understand and correctly use the basic tools of credit risk management, both from a theoretical and, most of all, a practical point of view. This will be a quite unconventional course. For each methodology, we will analyse its strengths as well as its weaknesses. We will do this in a rigorous way, but also with fun: there is no need to be boring. Thanks to the wonderful feedback of last year’s students, the course has been further improved. Follow us on Twitter @CRMooc for updates and hints about the course. FAQs What is the estimated effort for course? The total effort is 48 hours. You can decide for yourself when you will work on the course. How much does it cost to take the course? Nothing! The course is free. Will the text of the lectures be available? Yes. All of our lectures will have transcripts synced to the videos. Do I need to watch the lectures live? No. You can watch the lectures at your leisure. Is this course related to campus courses of Delft University of Technology? Yes, this course can be seen as an evolution of the WI3421TU Risk Management course, a compulsory course of the Minor Finance at TU Delft.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=34566</url></Course><Course><course_id>20343</course_id><title>Responsible Innovation: Ethics, Safety and Technology</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>2</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Jeroen van den Hoven</instructor><school>School:  Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)</school><description>There is no doubt that technological innovation is one of the key elements driving human progress. However, new technologies raise ethical questions, have serious implications for society and the environment and pose new risks, often unknown and unknowable before the new technologies reach maturity. For example, how can we make sure that “smart cities” and other data-based services strike a balance between the benefits the service provides and the risks it poses to the security of citizens? What are the ethical questions surrounding self-driving vehicles or autonomous weapons? What are the health risks of nanotechnologies? All these create new risks and raise serious ethical questions. The challenge is to innovate in a way that benefits both companies and society – to innovate responsibly. This course provides both a theoretical and practical framework for assessing and designing responsible innovations, combined with real-world examples. The first part (weeks 1 and 2) of the course focuses on ethical questions and concerns, such as: a fair distribution of costs and benefits, moral obligations and individual and collective responsibilities. The second part (weeks 3 and 4) deals with (unknown) risks and safety of new technologies including a number of qualitative and quantitative risk assessment methods. The last part of the course (weeks 5, 6 and 7) is about the management of responsible innovations and evolving a new, value driven, design process. Case studies during the course include nanotechnology, self-driving vehicles, smart meters for electricity, autonomous weapons, nuclear energy and CO2capture and storage together with their related ethical and safety concerns.  Affordable innovations for low-income groups and emerging markets are also covered in the course. The course includes a free e-book. The course will be of benefit to innovation and risk managers, entrepreneurs, policy analysts, engineers, designers and strategic advisors who are looking for a methodical approach with which to judge responsible innovations.  </description><url>/enroll?course_id=20343</url></Course><Course><course_id>51486</course_id><title>Computational Geometry: GIS, CAD, and Other Applications</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>2</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Junhui Deng</instructor><school>School:  Tsinghua University</school><description>Geometry can be traced back to ancient Greece, but Computational Geometry evolved less than 40 years as a branch of computer science.

At MIT, the content of the five modules makes the first of a two-semester sequence (8.421 and 8.422) for graduate students interested in Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics. This sequence is required for Ph.D. students doing research in this field. In these modules you will learn about the interaction of radiation with atoms: resonance; absorption, stimulated and spontaneous emission; methods of resonance, dressed atom formalism, masers and lasers, cavity quantum electrodynamics; structure of simple atoms, behavior in very strong fields; fundamental tests: time reversal, parity violations, Bell's inequalities; and experimental methods. Completing the two-course sequence allows you to pursue advanced study and research in cold atoms, as well as specialized topics in condensed matter physics.   FAQ Who can register for this course? Unfortunately, learners from Iran, Cuba, Sudan and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time. While edX has received a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to offer courses to learners from Iran and Sudan our license does not cover this course.

It will give you a unified overview of mechanics that will dramatically increase your problem-solving ability. It is open to all students who meet the prerequisites (see right), but is especially designed for teachers and students who want to improve their existing understanding of mechanics. Newtonian mechanics is the study of how forces change the motion of objects. This course begins with force, and moves on to straight-line motion, momentum, mechanical energy, rotational motion, angular momentum, and harmonic oscillators. Optional units include planetary orbits and a unit whose problems require multiple concepts to be applied to obtain one solution. NOTE: New Section “Problem-solving Pedagogy” We have developed a special approach to organizing the physics content knowledge and for applying it when solving problems.  This approach is called “Modeling Applied to Problem Solving” and has been researched carefully and has proven effectiveness for improving students’ performance in a later physics course on Electricity and Magnetism. If you are a teacher looking to improve your knowledge of mechanics, or to learn new approaches to teach your students, we encourage you to sign up in the special teacher section featuring a discussion forum for teachers to discuss teaching ideas and techniques related to the topics discussed in this course.  To join these discussions,  verify yourself as a teacher, and we will sign you up in the teacher forum. Note that this forum is exclusively reserved for teachers, so please do not register if you are not a teacher. Teachers in the United States, and especially in Massachusetts, can receive extra benefit from this course. We offer Professional Development Points (PDPs) at no charge to teachers in Massachusetts who complete our course. If you are in a different state, we instead offer Continuing Education Units through the American Association of Physics Teachers. There is a fee for this certificate. Course Syllabus Note: Taking this Course Involves Using Some Experimental Materials The RELATE group that authors and administers this course is an education research group, dedicated to understanding and improving education, especially online.  We showed that 8.MReV generated slightly more conceptual learning than a conventionally taught on-campus course  - but we were unable to find exactly what caused this learning.   (So far this is the only published measurement of learning in a MOOC).  This summer we will be comparing learning from different types of online activities that  will be administerered to randomly assigned sub-groups of our students.  At certain points in the course, new vs. previously used sequences of activities will be assigned to different groups.  We will then use common questions to compare the amount learned. Which group receives the new activities will be switched so that neither group will have all new activities. Our experimental protocol has been approved by the MIT Committee on Use of Human Subjects.  As part of this approval we have the obligation to inform you about these experiments and to assure you that: We will not divulge any information about you that may be identified as yours personally (e.g. a discussion post showing your user name).  The grade for obtaining a certificate will be adjusted downwards (from 60%) to compensate if one group has harder materials. Note: By clicking on the registration button, you indicate that you understand that everyone who participates in this course is randomly assigned to one of the groups described above.  Welcome, and we hope you will both learn from and enjoy this course. FAQs Is there a required textbook? You do not need to buy a textbook. All material is included in this edX course and is viewable online. If you would like to use a textbook with the course (for example, as a reference), most calculus-level books are suitable. Introductory physics books by Young and Freedman, Halliday and Resnick, or Knight are all appropriate (and older editions are fine).   What if I take a vacation? The course schedule is designed with this in mind! Course contents are released four weeks ahead of the deadline, so even if you have a four-week vacation, you do not need to miss any deadlines and can still complete all of the material.   Will I get a certficiate? Yes! This course awards certificates to all who satisfactorily complete the required portion of the course.   How are grades assigned? There are three parts of the course that are worth points: Checkpoint problems that are folded in with the reading, Homework problems that come at the end of each unit, and Quizzes that are at the end of every 1-2 units. Each is worth a varying number of points, and you will not have to do every problem. The course consists of 11 required units and three optional units. You do not need to complete the optional units in order to receive a certificate.

Contracts are promises that the law will enforce. But when will the law refuse to honor a promise? What happens when one party does not hold to their part of the deal? We are exposed to contracts in all areas of our life — agreeing to terms when downloading a new computer program, hiring a contractor to repair a leaking roof, and even ordering a meal at a restaurant. Knowing the principles of contracts is not just a skill needed by lawyers, it illuminates for everyone a crucial institution that we use all the time and generally take for granted. This contract law course, with new materials and updated case examples, is designed to introduce the range of issues that arise when entering and enforcing contracts. It will provide an introduction to what a contract is and also analyze the purpose and significance of contracts. Then, it will discuss the intent to create legal relations, legality and morality, and the distinction between gifts and bargains. The course also investigates common pitfalls: one-sided promises, mistake, fraud, and frustration. With the knowledge of what makes contracts and how they can go wrong, Professor Fried will discuss remedies and specific performance. Finally, Professor Fried will introduce how contracts can create rights for third parties.  The course’s instructor, Charles Fried, has been teaching at Harvard Law School for more than 50 years and has written extensively on contracts. Not only is Professor Fried a leading authority on contract law, but he also utilizes a story-telling approach to explaining the topic, which creates a unique and interesting class experience.

We will examine the impact of key events such as Bleeding Kansas, the Dred Scott decision, the Lincoln-Douglas debates, and John Brown’s raid on Harper’s Ferry, and end with the dissolution of the Union in the winter of 1860-61. This course is part of the X Series, Civil War and Reconstruction, which introduces students to the most pivotal era in American history. The Civil War transformed the nation by eliminating the threat of secession and destroying the institution of slavery. It raised questions that remain central to our understanding of ourselves as a people and a nation – the balance of power between local and national authority, the boundaries of citizenship, and the meanings of freedom and equality. This X Series will examine the causes of the war, the road to secession, the conduct of the Civil War, the coming of emancipation, and the struggle after the war to breathe meaning into the promise of freedom for four million emancipated slaves. One theme throughout the series is what might be called the politics of history – how the world in which a historian lives affects his or her view of the past, and how historical interpretations reinforce or challenge the social order of the present.

How does the cellular machinery accomplish such a feat without making more mistakes than you can survive? Why isn’t the incidence of cancer even higher than it is? And, if the DNA in each and every cell is two meters long, how is this genetic material compacted to fit inside the cell nucleus without becoming a tangled mess?   Are you ready to go beyond the “what" of scientific information presented in textbooks and explore how scientists deduce the details of these molecular models?   Take a behind-the-scenes look at modern molecular genetics, from the classic experimental events that identified the proteins involved in DNA replication and repair to cutting-edge assays that apply the power of genome sequencing. Do you feel confident in your ability to design molecular biology experiments and interpret data from them? We've designed the problems in this course to build your experimental design and data analysis skills.   Let’s explore the limits of our current knowledge about the replication machinery and pathways that protect the fidelity of DNA synthesis.

Have you started a novel only to run out of steam halfway through? Led by international best-selling authors and professors from The University of British Columbia’s world-renowned Creative Writing MFA program, this is the first in a series of courses designed to take your novel from concept to completion. Outlining is a crucial step in the novel writing process, one that fuels creativity and prepares the writer to stay on track and avoid common pitfalls. Through hands-on weekly exercises with a focus on craft and process, as well as insights from the real-world practices of accomplished authors, this course explores the core elements of fiction writing necessary to build an outline. You will learn the fundamentals of character development, world-building and the basics of storytelling architecture. You'll work intensively on your own creative project and hone your outline through feedback and discussion with fellow writers. In the tradition of the UBC MFA program, this course draws on the work habits of established authors to help writers move quickly toward creating a blueprint for a successful draft. Whether you’re seeking literary fame or working on a project to share with family and friends, this course offers the tools and skills necessary to plan a novel others will be excited to read. The course is recommended for professional and aspiring writers, writing groups, participants in NaNoWriMo, teachers and anyone who has ever dreamed of writing a novel. FAQ Do I need to have started a novel to take this course? No. However, you should have one or more novel ideas that you wish to work on during this course. We will ask you to start developing your idea right away. What if I’m in the middle of a novel? If you have already started a novel, or are having issues with a partially finished manuscript without an outline, this course can help you clarify your intentions and work out structural issues. We believe the process of outlining helps writers understand a work in progress in a way that simply ‘writing through’ cannot. Is this course related to an existing UBC writing class? This is an entirely new course, created by instructors with years of experience teaching the art of fiction writing to undergraduate and graduate university students as well as members of the community. What are the other courses in the series? How to Write a Novel – Part 2: Writing the Draft will provide an essential fiction craft toolbox for writers struggling with the common hurdles of first drafts. How to Write a Novel – Part 3: Edit and Revise, is in the early stages of development. When it is launched, it will be suitable for students who have completed a full draft of their novel.

Twenty years ago, we had no idea whether any of the countless stars out there beyond our solar system had planets or not. Today, things are totally different. Over 1,000 planetary systems have been discovered. The universe is teeming with planets. And what strange planets they are - hot Jupiter-like planets skimming the surfaces of their stars, cold and lonely free-floating planets far from any star, planets made of diamond, planets with rain made of glass, super-Earths and even planets orbiting neutron stars. In this course, we’ll bring you up-to-date with the latest research on exoplanets, and how this research has revolutionised our understanding of the formation of solar systems like our own. This course is designed for people who would like to get a deeper understanding of these mysteries than that offered by popular science articles and shows. You will need reasonable high-school level mathematics and physics to get the most out of this course. This is the second of four ANUx courses which together make up the Australian National University's first year astrophysics program. It follows on from the introductory course on the Greatest Unsolved Mysteries of the Universe, and is followed by courses on the violent universe and on cosmology.

However, this novel is most remembered for its depiction of health violations and unclean conditions in the American meatpacking industry. These findings were based on an investigation Sinclair did as a journalist..  Sinclair spent several weeks gathering information while working in the meatpacking plants of the Chicago stockyards for the newspaper Appeal to Reason. The Jungle was first published in serial form in 1905 in the newspaper. A film version of the novel was made in 1914, but it has been lost. The novel highlights working class poverty, the lack of social support, harsh living and working conditions, and a bleak outlook for the working poor. This is contrasted with the corruption of those in power. Participants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion. Course materials will include background information for understanding the text, as well as vocabulary and language support.

Diwan</instructor><school>School:  KIx: Karolinska Institutet</school><description>For the first hundreds of years of modern medicine, progress was a process of trial and error, and to be honest, it was often fatal error, such as bloodletting, which killed the first US president George Washington. Where diseases were clearly understood, and where treatments obviously worked on most patients, such as penicillin for pneumonia, there was no need to delve deeper into questions of effectiveness. But for most conditions, the treatment benefits were modest and there was a need for improved ways of telling whether a new intervention was better than the previous standard treatment. And so scientists introduced a testing procedure for new treatments - the randomized controlled trial. As the cost of developing new treatments grew, it became very important to detect the slightest improvement that could be attributed to the new drug in order to get it licensed and marketed. So the usual randomized trial was answering the following question: does this treatment work (for otherwise well people with just this single disease, with perfect adherence, treated by the best doctors, under idealised conditions)? But most patients have multiple diseases, imperfect adherence, ordinary doctors and non-ideal circumstances. These patients want to know whether a new treatment is likely to reduce important harms for ordinary people like them, receiving usual care. This mismatch meant that most trials were overestimating the real world effectiveness of new interventions. In this MOOC, we are going to study this mismatch, and see what its effect is on modern medical care. One example of the studies we will discuss is the VIGOR trial. This influential drug trial resulted in the widespread global overuse of this drug, at a cost of wasted billions of dollars. Ironically, this drug, intended to reduce a problem in individuals, ended up causing more of the same problem in the population! After we understand the consequences of designing the wrong kinds of trials, we will also look at how best to design pragmatic randomized trials, which answer the important questions that ordinary patients and decision makers in the real world most often ask. We will also explore how these can be combined with economic evaluations and qualitative research – to answer important questions about how much these interventions cost, and how they are experienced by the recipients.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=34564</url></Course><Course><course_id>40030</course_id><title>El Enlace Químico y las Interacciones Moleculares</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>1</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Juan Antonio Llorens Molina, Isabel Morera Bertomeu</instructor><school>School:  Universitat Politècnica de Valencia</school><description>Los materiales que utilizamos diariamente y los objetos que nos rodean están formados por sustancias químicas cuyas propiedades, aplicaciones y transformaciones dependen del tipo de enlace que las caracteriza.

But what makes a good learning game? Where do ideas come from and how do you create them? These are the questions that this course tries to answer. The premise of learning games from some perspectives seems like a perfect and easy solution - get people to learn things they don’t want to by motivating them through game play. To others it seems like an oxymoron - if learning is hard then it can’t possibly be fun at the same time. The key to designing good learning games is to reconcile these perspectives by creating games that focus on creating environments based on “hard fun.” This idea will be a central tenet of this course. Through six units comprising nine weeks, we will look at the evolution of educational video games and hear from experts working on many aspects of learning games from design to development to implementation. For the course project, participants will create their own learning game. This course utilizes Gameblox, a game editor that uses a block based programming language to allow anyone to create games.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=45185</url></Course><Course><course_id>24661</course_id><title>中级汉语语法 | Intermediate Chinese Grammar</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>1</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  徐晶凝 | Xu Jingning</instructor><school>School:  Peking University</school><description>本课程将讲解汉语作为第二语言学习中学习者最容易发生偏误的12个汉语最基本的语法项目，帮助学习者进一步理解、掌握这些语法项目在句法、语义及语用上的特点。 Improve your Chinese language proficiency in this intermediate Chinese grammar course.

It illustrates not only the challenges that the combatants faced, but also the plight of innocent victims– women, children, and the elderly. Though the Iliad is often regarded as a kind of Greek national epic, Homer is remarkably even-handed in his treatment of the two sides, even seeming to favor the Trojans over the Greeks at times. He repeatedly emphasizes the horrors of war and his varied descriptions of deaths on the battlefield are unparalleled in both intensity and, paradoxically, poetic charm. The primary objective of warfare in the imaginary time period depicted by Homer is to attain personal glory through acts of individual prowess, with the good of the community seen as a secondary goal.   This course explores the idea that war is both universal and particular. The Vietnam War was not the same as the Iraq War. In every war, some things are the same, while some are different. Intense suffering and horrific acts are inevitable. However, the mode of fighting, the resources, the arms, the equipment, the treatment of prisoners, the command structure, and the ideology driving men and women to fight all differ.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=45177</url></Course><Course><course_id>45505</course_id><title>Electronic Literature</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>1</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Robert McSwain, Kristen Eshleman, Sara Swanson, Mark Sample</instructor><school>School:  Davidson College</school><description>Love letters generated by a computer. An online poem two hundred trillion stanzas long. A mystery novel in the form of a wiki. The story of Inanimate Alice, told through videos and instant messages. An ocean buoy tweeting remixes of Moby Dick. Welcome to the weird world of electronic literature—digitally born poetic, narrative, and aesthetic works read on computers, tablets, and phones. Experimental, evocative, and sometimes simply puzzling, electronic literature challenges our assumptions about reading, writing, authorship, and meaning. Yet e-lit, as it is often called, has also profoundly influenced mainstream culture. Literature, film, comics, apps, and video games have all learned lessons from electronic literature. This course will trace the rise of electronic literature and explore both historic and contemporary works of e-lit. We’ll begin with electronic literature’s roots in avant-garde art and Cold War technology, and follow e-lit through the birth of the personal computer into the era of the Web and smartphone. At every step along the way the expressive power of new media—the way digital media enables and shapes different modes of creative and cultural expression—will be of particular interest to us.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=45505</url></Course><Course><course_id>45495</course_id><title>Science at the Polls: Biology for Voters, Part 1</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>1</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Jasper Rine, Fyodor Urnov</instructor><school>School:  Berkeley</school><description>Science plays a crucial role in your decisions as you go about your daily life.

The challenge of identifying effective ways to help people experiencing addiction is a serious one, and much depends on the quality of the clinical decisions we make. This course is intended to help you meet this challenge by increasing your understanding of the biology of addiction and the available treatment options in the different stages of the recovery journey. Key questions we will look at in this course include: Why is it so difficult to change addictive behaviour? What kinds of treatment can help a person experiencing addiction? What is my role as a professional, either within or outside of addiction care? How can I identify the best of the many options available? What evidence do I need to be able to make a sound decision about treatment? What approaches to addiction are proven to work around the world? What is the potential impact of my decisions on the life of a person experiencing addiction? This course explores the “Recovery Pathway,” an easy-to-use framework for helping people with addiction move successfully from addiction to recovery. It will help you to plan a pathway through screening and assessment, to withdrawal and long-term relapse prevention. It will examine a range of psychosocial interventions and medication-assisted treatments. At each step of the pathway, you will review the biological basis of behaviour and treatment as well as evidence-based and service delivery considerations. It is an ideal starting-point for healthcare professionals who want to get to grips with potentially effective approaches to treating addiction, and need tools to make critical decisions.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=46997</url></Course><Course><course_id>14365</course_id><title>Street-Fighting Math</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>1</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Isaac Chuang, Sanjoy Mahajan, Amira Eltony</instructor><school>School:  MIT</school><description>Too much mathematical rigor teaches rigor mortis: the fear of making an unjustified leap even when it lands on a correct result. Instead of paralysis, have courage: Shoot first and ask questions later. Although unwise as public policy, it is a valuable problem-solving philosophy and the theme of this course: how to guess answers without a proof or an exact calculation, in order to develop insight. You will learn this skill by mastering six reasoning tools---dimensional analysis, easy cases, lumping, pictorial reasoning, taking out the big part, and analogy. The applications will include mental calculation, estimating population growth rates, understanding drag without differential equations, singing musical intervals to estimate logarithms, approximating integrals, summing infinite series, and turning differential equations into algebra. Your learning will be supported by regular readings that you discuss with other students, by short tablet videos, by quick problems to help you check your understanding, by weekly homework problems, review and and a final exam. You will work hard, and, by the end of the course, have learned a rough-and-ready approach to using mathematics to understand the world.

If we want a high-energy future while protecting the natural world for our children, we must consider the environmental consequences of energy production and use. But money matters too: energy solutions that ignore economic costs are not realistic—particularly in a world where billions of people currently can’t afford access to basic energy services. How can we proceed? Energy Within Environmental Constraints won’t give you the answer. Instead, we will teach you how to ask the right questions and estimate the consequences of different choices. This course is intended for a diverse audience. Whether you are a student, an activist, a policymaker, a business owner, or a concerned citizen, this course will help you start to think carefully about our current energy system and how we can improve its environmental performance. This course: Covers engineering, environmental science, and economics to enable critical, quantitative thinking about our energy system Focuses on a working understanding of energy technologies, rich in details of real devices and light on theory; you won’t find any electrodynamics here but will find enough about modern commercial solar panels to estimate if they would be profitable to install in a given location Covers environmental impacts of the energy system, focusing on air pollution, climate change, and land use Emphasizes costs: the cascade of capital and operating costs from energy extraction all the way through end uses Emphasizes quantitative comparisons and tradeoffs: how much more expensive is electricity from solar panels than from coal plants, and how much pollution does it prevent?  Is solar power as cost-effective an environmental investment as nuclear power or energy efficiency?  And how do we include considerations other than cost?

El Análisis de Imágenes o Visión por Computador es la capacidad de los ordenadores de analizar imágenes capturadas por una cámara y obtener la información de los objetos que se hayan presentes en esa escena. En la actualidad, constituye uno de los campos de la Inteligencia Artificial con un mayor ritmo de desarrollo y que más aplicaciones nuevas está presentando. Hasta hace pocos años las cámaras digitales solo estaban implantadas en el ambiente industrial. Allí se utilizan con dos fines: Lograr una mayor interacción entre los robots industriales y el entorno que los rodea. Conseguir un control de calidad total de los productos fabricados. Con la aparición de nuevo hardware, cámaras y algoritmos, el mundo de la Visión por Computador ya no se centra exclusivamente en el ambiente industrial sino que se extiende a los smartphones, la industria del videojuego e incluso a los coches. Otra característica que ha cambiado recientemente es que hasta hace poco tiempo las técnicas de análisis de imágenes eran accesibles solamente a un reducido número de especialistas. Los programas que se utilizaban eran costosos, con poca documentación y que exigían equipos informáticos de gama alta. Esto es ahora muy distinto; en concreto la biblioteca OpenCV, que se verá en el curso, constituyen una solución de altísimo nivel, gratuitas, portables a diversos sistemas operativos y equipos, ordenadores o teléfonos inteligentes y que constituyen de facto un estándar en la comunidad científica. Para que el alumnado pueda realizar diversas aplicaciones relacionadas con la Visión por Computador, a lo largo del curso se revisan los tipos básicos de elementos y sensores, viéndose las ventajas e inconvenientes de cada uno de ellos, así como las técnicas más usuales de procesar la información que proveen. A partir de dicho procesamiento de la información y de la extracción de características, se presentan diversos métodos para el reconocimiento de patrones.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=47006</url></Course><Course><course_id>51484</course_id><title>International Business Environment and Global Strategy</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>34</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Dr Sushil Vachani</instructor><school>School:  Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore</school><description>This course focuses on the social, political, economic and institutional environment of countries.

Labor, students, farmers, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the military play a crucial role, making the analysis of country environments complex and fascinating. We will study Japan in some depth, and catch brief glimpses of South Korea, Singapore, Chile, Turkey, India, South Africa and the former Soviet Union, to appreciate the forces that influence diverse country environments, and companies’ strategies. The course will review aspects of global institutions, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), which set global rules that profoundly affect business strategy and human welfare. It will also explore opportunities and challenges at the bottom of the pyramid, the last frontier for value creation by companies and NGOs.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=51484</url></Course><Course><course_id>69866</course_id><title>Introduction to People Management</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>32</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Vasanthi Srinivasan</instructor><school>School:  Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore</school><description>Do you aspire to be an ideal people manager?

This is a hands-on, learn-by-doing course that shows you how to build solutions to real-world problems using embedded systems. The course uses a bottom-up approach to problem solving, building gradually from simple interfacing of switches and LEDs to complex concepts like display drivers, digital to analog conversion, generation of sound, analog to digital conversion, graphics, interrupts, and communication. We will present both general principles and practical tips for building circuits and programming the microcontroller in the C programming language. You will develop debugging skills using oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, and software instrumentation. Laboratory assignments are first performed in simulation, and then you will build and debug your system on the real microcontroller. At the conclusion of this course you will possess the knowledge to build your own arcade-style game from the ground up. This is the third time we have offered this course. Since the reviews have been overwhelmingly positive we do not plan major changes from the previous offering of the course. There are 14 labs, but students can pick and choose seven of them to achieve certification. The three labs that students found most rewarding were the finite state machine traffic light controller, generating sound using a digital to analog convertor, and creating a smart object using Wifi communication. This time we will make minor changes to a few labs to enhance the fun and focus the learning on embedded systems. To complete this course, you will be required to purchase a Texas Instruments TM4C123 microcontroller kit and a few electronic components. This microcontroller has a state-of-the-art ARM Cortex-M4 processor. We will provide instructions about purchasing the kit and installing required software at: http://edx-org-utaustinx.s3.amazonaws.com/UT601x/index.html. FAQ How will the Spring 2016 course be the same as the course run Spring 2015? This course will be lab-based using the same Texas Instruments Tiva series TM4C123 LaunchPad and the set of extra components. We will continue to use the Keil development system, and students will first develop/test in simulation followed by testing on the real board. 12 of the 14 labs will be essentially the same and two labs will be upgraded. Same as last year, students will need to complete at least seven of the labs on the real board to achieve certification. How will the Spring 2016 course be different from the course run Spring 2015? This time we will make minor changes to a few labs to enhance the fun and focus the learning on embedded systems. Is this class related to a campus course of The University of Texas at Austin? Yes, this course corresponds to the Electrical and Computer Engineering course EE319K Introduction to Embedded Systems, which is a required course offered in the freshman year to all ECE students and some BME students. Is there a textbook associated with this class? The class is based on the textbook Embedded Systems: Introduction to ARM Cortex-M Microcontrollers ISBN: 978-1477508992. However, the purchase of the textbook is not required. Do I need a Windows PC? Yes, any system running Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 10 will be ok. Furthermore, with a third party virtualization software like Parallels or VMware Fusion, one can install the Windows operating system on a Mac. How much does it cost to take this class? It does not cost anything to take the class. However, since this a lab-based class, there is a lab kit you will purchase. You will also have the option of obtaining an ID Verified certificate for a $50 fee. How much does the kit cost? In the US one can purchase the microcontroller board and parts for about $40 USD plus shipping. There is also an optional graphics display for an additional $10 USD plus shipping. The optional graphics display will make the last lab a lot more fun. The CC3100 Boosterpack costs $20 USD plus shipping and will be required if you wish to complete the Wifi lab. Can I take this course without buying the kit? Yes, there are three approaches to taking this class. You could listen to the videos, read the assignments, and play with the interactive learning tools. The second option involves installing the Keil uVision integrated development environment on a Windows PC, and performing the lab assignments in simulation mode. The third option, which fully captures the essence of embedded systems, can be done by performing the lab assignments on a real system that you will purchase. Can I use another microcontroller? If you are following approach one, where you are listening to the videos, reading the assignments and playing with the interactive tools, then you can use any microcontroller. However, if you wish to obtain certification, you will need to use the Tiva series TM4C123 so you can interact with the automatic graders. What does it mean for the display to be optional? In the last lab you will build an arcade-style game. We expect most students will connect the microcontroller board to the PC. In this manner the game output can be displayed on a window of the PC. However, for about $10 USD plus shipping, you can order a small Nokia 5110 LCD display so your game can be operated in a stand-alone fashion. Will this course really take 10 hours per week? The first option of just listening, reading and playing with interactive animations will take two or three hours per week. The second option of performing the labs in simulation will take five or six hours per week. The third option of building and testing systems on the real microcontroller will require 10 hours per week. Can I take this course if I have never programmed before? Anyone is allowed register, but we believe to get the maximum benefit you should have prior programming experience at an introductory level. However, this could be your second class involving programming. Can I contact the Instructors or Teaching Assistants? Yes, but not directly. The discussion forums are the appropriate venue for questions about the course. Instructors will monitor these forums and try to respond to the most important questions; in many cases responses from other students will be adequate and faster. I really want to take this course, what is next? You should purchase the microcontroller and extra electronics before the start of class. This class is available worldwide and we will provide region-specific methods to obtain the kit at http://edx-org-utaustinx.s3.amazonaws.com/UT601x/index.html.  </description><url>/enroll?course_id=48093</url></Course><Course><course_id>45323</course_id><title>Introduction to Financial and Management Accounting</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>28</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Barry Walsh, Tara Askham, Linsey Taylor</instructor><school>School:  ACCA</school><description>Interested in a career in business?

To make good decisions, you need to understand the market forces that impact your business and personal life. This is true for managers in large multinationals or small businesses, in non-profit organizations or in the government. Individuals and households also make decisions. They decide on what to learn, where to work, how much to save, where to invest, and what goods to buy, among others. Most modern societies depend on markets to organize economic activity: they are market economies. A large number of decisions you make as individuals or as managers relate to markets. So it is important for you to know how markets work and how to make good decisions as a manager or as an individual operating in a market environment. This is what this course will teach you. Most business schools have a course on Managerial Economics as part of the MBA curriculum. Exposure to Economics is essential for all students of management. This course will provide a simple introduction to Managerial Economics and use minimum mathematics.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=69538</url></Course><Course><course_id>47683</course_id><title>Supply Chain Design</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>23</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Chris Caplice, Yossi Sheffi, James Blayney Rice Jr., Jarrod Goentzel</instructor><school>School:  MIT</school><description>Supply chains, especially global supply chains, are complex structures that involve several businesses crossing multiple time zones and continents. The design of a supply chain is critical to its overall success, and ultimately, the firm’s success. This business and management course will cover all aspects of supply chain design. We will start with learning how to design for the flow of physical products or goods. Variously referred to as Network Design, Facility Location, or Flow Optimization, the physical design is a core requirement for any supply chain planner. Following this, we will dive into the design of the financial flows involved with supply chains. Specifically, you will learn how to translate supply chain terms and metrics into financial terms used in the C-suite. We will then proceed into the design and management of the information flow of a supply chain by examining three critical phases: procurement, production, and demand planning. Our primary objective here is to understand how a business works with different partners in these three basic supply chain activities. The procurement lessons will cover basic approaches as well as more advanced techniques such as combinatorial auctions and supply contracts. The production lessons will concentrate on material resource planning (MRP) and fixed horizon planning. The demand management lessons will examine collaboration as well as sales and operations planning (S-OP). After covering the design of the three flows (physical, financial, and information), we will turn to the design of the supply chain organization itself as well as the metrics. Real cases and examples from practice will be used throughout the entire course. This course is part of the MITx MicroMasters Credential in Supply Chain Management that is specifically designed to teach the critical skills needed to be successful in this exciting field. In order to qualify for the MicroMasters Credential you will need to earn a Verified Certificate in each of the five courses as well as pass a Capstone Exam. When you sign up for a CTL.SC2x Verified Certificate you will also be granted access to supplemental content such as additional practice problems and complementary videos.

In the past decade astronomers have made incredible advances in the discovery of planets outside our solar system. Thirty years ago, we knew only of the planets in our own solar system. Now we know of thousands circling nearby stars. Meanwhile, biologists have gained a strong understanding of how life evolved on our own planet, all the way back to the earliest cells. We can describe how simple molecules can assemble themselves into the building blocks of life, and how those building blocks might have become the cells that make up our bodies today. Super-Earths And Life is all about how these two fields together - astronomy and biology - can answer one of our most powerful and primal questions: are we alone in the universe?

Since that time, U.S. troops, covert operatives and proxies have engaged in costly exertions in predominantly Muslim societies everywhere from the Levant and the Persian Gulf to East Africa and Central Asia. With what result? Washington's efforts have exacted a terrible toll, squandering vast amounts of blood and treasure. In the meantime, the Islamic world has become less stable while anti-American radicalism flourishes. America’s War for the Greater Middle East has failed, and that failure is irreversible. This course offers a history of that war, for better understanding of the factors that inspired the United States to launch the conflict and to persist in a doomed enterprise. Inviting you to learn how the war unfolded from one phase to the next, from the era of Jimmy Carter to the age of Barack Obama, it catalogs the errors of judgment and implementation made along the way. Finally, it encourages you to consider alternative approaches to policy that might have better served the interests of the United States and of the people living in countries invaded, occupied, bombed and otherwise subjected to American punishment.  </description><url>/enroll?course_id=34840</url></Course><Course><course_id>69976</course_id><title>The Engineering of Structures Around Us</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>22</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Petra Bonfert-Taylor, Michael Goudzwaard, Vicki May, Jay Beaudoin, Jenny Seong, Jared Benedict, Sawyer Broadley</instructor><school>School:  Dartmouth College</school><description>In this introductory course, you’ll learn some engineering principles that can be applied to structural systems everywhere: in nature, in furniture, in mechanical and aerospace systems, and in any solid object that resists a load. Together we’ll explore how structures work, why they were designed the way they were designed, how they support loads, and where forces flow through them. More specifically we’ll: Learn about funicular forms and how ropes and cables resist tension. Discuss how columns, arches, and anti-funicular forms resist compression. Discover how trusses, beams and walls resist loads. • Sketch the flow of forces through structures. Compare and contrast different structural forms and systems to answer a range of questions such as: Why might an engineer choose a beam over a truss? How do the dimensions of a structure affect its response? How do engineers choose forms and systems to create structures that are both elegant and functional?

This course introduces Cognitive Neuroscience Robotics with two approaches: the synthetic and the analytic approach. The synthetic approach means an engineering approach to understand human cognitive functions synthetically, trying to understand human cognitive functions by replicating them as artificial systems and putting them into social environments. Specifically, it develops artificial systems such as robots based on findings in neuroscience and physiology, and investigates how they could acquire intelligent behaviors through interaction with others and the environment. On the other hand, human cognitive activities are investigated analytically. They are supported by higher functions of the brain and have been examined by psychological experiments or brain imaging. With the analytic approach, psychologists, cognitive scientists, and medical doctors are pursuing an understanding of the mechanism of the mind and its biological basis, with the help of engineering and philosophy. This program will help students make a basis for interdisciplinary research by providing opportunities to understand what is undertaken in other disciplines and how to collaborate and exchange ideas with people from other disciplines. We expect many motivated students to apply.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=51181</url></Course><Course><course_id>49842</course_id><title>Career Edge: Business and Data Analysis</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>2</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Jim Pautz, Caroline Young</instructor><school>School:  Fullbridge</school><description>Understanding how to analyze, synthesize and communicate data is increasingly critical in the modern workplace.

We believe that scientists and cultural critics can learn valuable lessons from one another, even as they create their own responses to HIV/AIDS. Today, over 30 years since the first scientific reports of HIV/AIDS, the pandemic remains a major health concern throughout the world. But, rays of hope have led to speculation that an AIDS-free generation may be possible. In such a timely moment, it is essential for us to connect across the "two cultures" as we consider the social and scientific implications of HIV/AIDS.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=36142</url></Course><Course><course_id>49850</course_id><title>Western Civilization: Ancient and Medieval Europe</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>3</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Ian Frederick Moulton</instructor><school>School:  Arizona State University</school><description>This course will provide a general outline of European history from Ancient times through 1500 AD, covering a variety of European historical periods and cultures, including Greek, Roman, Byzantine, Celtic, Frankish and others.

Interestingly the same amazing technology has also led to a deeper understanding of the nature of current flow on an atomic scale and my aim is to make these lessons from nanoelectronics accessible to anyone in any branch of science or engineering. I will assume very little background beyond linear algebra and differential equations, although we will be discussing advanced concepts in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics that should be of interest even to specialists.   In the first half of this course (4 weeks) we will introduce a new perspective connecting the quantized conductance of short ballistic conductors to the familiar Ohm's law of long diffusive conductors, along with a brief description of the modern nanotransistor. In the second half (4 weeks) we will address fundamental conceptual issues related to the meaning of resistance on an atomic scale, the interconversion of electricity and heat, the second law of thermodynamics and the fuel value of information.   Overall I hope to show that the lessons of nanoelectronics lead naturally to a new viewpoint, one that changes even some basic concepts we all learn in freshman physics. This unique viewpoint not only clarifies many old questions but also provides a powerful approach to new questions at the frontier of modern nanoelectronics, such as how devices can be built to control the spin of electrons.   This course was originally offered in 2012 on nanoHUB-U and the accompanying text was subsequently published by World Scientific. I am preparing a second edition for publication in 2015, which will be used for this course. The manuscript will be made available to registered students.   Sample comments: From Roald Hoffmann, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roald_Hoffmann Cornell University  "… the pedagogical imperative in research is very important to me, and so I really value a kindred spirit. Your (Datta's) online courses are just wonderful!"   From anonymous student in previous offering. "The course was just awesome .. Prof. Datta's style of delivering lecture is mind-blowing."   This course is the latest in a series offered by the nanoHUB-U project which is jointly funded by Purdue and NSF with the goal of transcending disciplines through short courses accessible to students in any branch of science or engineering. These courses focus on cutting-edge topics distilled into short lectures with quizzes and practice exams.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=41390</url></Course><Course><course_id>19239</course_id><title>AnatomyX: Musculoskeletal Cases</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>2</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Trudy Van Houten, Michael Parker, Alexander Bick</instructor><school>School:  Harvard University</school><description>Musculoskeletal AnatomyX invites students to join basic science and clinical faculty at Harvard Medical School (HMS) to learn about several musculoskeletal injuries commonly seen in clinical practice. For each case, students visit the HMS Clinical Skills Center to observe the initial patient encounter and physical examination by an orthopedic surgeon. Following the patient encounter, students complete the interactive gross anatomy, histology and radiology learning sessions essential for understanding the case. The anatomy learning sessions include observing actual dissections in the Harvard Medical School anatomy laboratories revealing and explaining the human anatomy relevant for each clinical case. After completing the case learning sessions, students review pertinent radiology images, commit to a tentative diagnosis from a list of differential diagnoses, and accompany the patient to a virtual operating room to observe the surgical treatment.  In the virtual operating room, students observe narrated videos of actual surgical procedures. Clinical content for each case is developed in close collaboration with leading orthopedic surgeons and radiologists at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. This course will contain videos, photographs, and other content, including anatomical images and videos showing cadaver dissection, that some people may find offensive, disturbing or inappropriate.   HarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code : https://www.edx.org/edx-terms-service.

No cabe duda de que entender cómo se comportan las estructuras es fundamental para entender el mundo que nos rodea, para comprender la naturaleza y para juzgar mejor los progresos que ha hecho la humanidad a lo largo de la historia. Sin embargo, los ingenieros hemos fallado una y otra vez cuando hemos intentado explicar esta materia de forma que los no entendidos puedan entender su importancia. Este curso pretende saltar esa brecha existente entre los expertos en cálculo de estructuras y los profanos utilizando un lenguaje asequible, empleando ejemplos históricos y proponiendo ensayos sencillos que pueden hacerse en casa. El curso abordará no sólo el problema de por qué los edificios y los puentes se caen sino también otras muchas cuestiones ¿Por qué las ventanas de los aviones son redondas? ¿Por qué los gusanos tienen esa forma? ¿Por qué los murciélagos pueden volar dentro de un rosal sin rasgarse las alas? ¿Cómo funcionan las arterias? ¿Por qué las catedrales góticas pueden ser tan esbeltas? ¿Por qué hay construcciones romanas que siguen en pie 2000 años después? ¿Qué podemos aprender sobre los constructores de las diferentes estructuras que nos han legado nuestros antepasados?

But what is CSR? What does it mean, and what does it involve? Do stakeholders really care, and if they do, how should companies communicate with them? In uncertain modern climates, CSR is a crucial driving force of a (r)evolution in business. If you are interested in the relationship between business and society, this course is for you! It is especially relevant for industry, public policy, and academic professionals working on CSR, as well as students following a traditional business curriculum who are interested in key value questions. The content is also accessible for consumers who are curious about how to make informed decisions while pursuing their own well-defined, long-term, responsible consumption goals. This course addresses CSR in two ways: As a reflection of corporate self-awareness As a source of innovation and a means to deal with heightened competitiveness, demands for sustainable development, and shifts in international governance By presenting insights from CSR experts, from both academia and practice, this course provides a way for managers, consumers, and citizens to acquire in-depth insights and critical perspectives on companies’ CSR activities and communications. The multi-industry case study structure of this course enables participants to confront the challenges facing today’s managers as they seek to develop and communicate their own CSR initiatives. Dedicated discussion forums also are available for participants to present personalized CSR cases. To help participants manage and communicate about CSR with various internal and external stakeholders, this course seeks to:   Support current and future business leaders in their efforts to make responsible leadership, sustainable production, and consumption central to their corporate vision.   Help citizens to function more effectively as informed watchdogs and responsible consumers. </description><url>/enroll?course_id=51353</url></Course><Course><course_id>45499</course_id><title>The Biology of Water and Health - Sustainable Interventions</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>2</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Jeffrey Griffiths MD,MPH,AB,TM, David M.

Together, we will explore how to create sustainable interventions geared towards improving population health. This course provides an interdisciplinary framework for understanding the place of water in health policy and engineering by delving into the complex social, economic, political and scientific factors that influence how we approach these critical health and water related challenges.  We identify threats to our water supply, including climate change, urbanization, agriculture and emerging contaminants. We lead a water sampling field trip and analyze the results in order to understand how water quality is assessed and regulated. We learn how to conduct a “Risk Assessment” as it relates to human and environmental health. The class will debate about issues such as water privatization, social and environmental justice and hydrofracturing. We’ll learn about point of use interventions for local interventions and take a field trip to the massive Massachusetts Water Resources Authority to see firsthand how large scale interventions are built and managed. Lastly, we will learn about various anthological determinants that drive the sustainability of interventions, review strategies for water management in developing and developed countries, and discuss the opportunities and challenges with implementing these solutions. In addition to lectures hosted by Tufts Professors Dr. David M. Gute and Dr. Jeffrey K. Griffiths, the course features field trips, and guest lecturers comprised of renowned water professionals, entrepreneurs and scientists from the fields of public health, engineering, environmental science and health policy. We hope that your ability to conceptualize and address water-related issues will advance as a result of the lecture content, in class demonstrations and global dialogues. To achieve this goal, we strongly encourage active participation and discussion with the professors, students and water professionals from across the globe.  Lastly, check out the content from The Biology of Water and Health – Fundamentals (PH241x), an archived course that provides a provocative introduction to topics such as the vital role of sanitation and hygiene, waterborne diseases, environmental epidemiology, and water contaminants.

The codex, with its portability and instant access to any place in the text, became the dominant container for writing after the 4th century BCE, but scrolls continued to be made. Why and how did the scroll format remain popular and relevant in the age of the codex? This course proposes four main reasons, which  account for essentially every kind of scroll that still exists today. We will see and examine in detail a number of beautiful objects, and come to understand the thinking of those who chose the scroll format for their texts. This module features four main units, each of which is based on one of the reasons for scroll-making: Scrolls of indeterminate length Scrolls in long format Ceremonial and archaizing scrolls Portable scrolls Scrolls in the Age of the Book also features a guided tour of an exhibition on Harvard University’s collection of medieval scrolls, held at Houghton Library, Harvard’s special collections library, in Spring 2014. Each scroll featured in the exhibit has been fully digitized by Harvard’s Preservation Services division, and participants will have the opportunity to interact with them in unprecedented fashion using Mirador, a state-of-the-art web application developed by Harvard and Stanford Universities.

This course follows a modern dynamical systems approach to the subject. In particular, equations are analyzed using qualitative, numerical, and if possible, symbolic techniques. MATH226 is essentially the edX equivalent of MA226, a one-semester course in ordinary differential equations taken by more than 500 students per year at Boston University. It is divided into three parts. MATH226.1 is the first of these three parts. In MATH226.1, we will discuss biological and physical models that can be expressed as differential equations with one or two dependent variables. We will discuss geometric/qualitative and numerical techniques that apply to all differential equations. When possible, we will study some of the standard symbolic solution techniques such as separation of variables and the use of integrating factors. We will also study the theory of existence and uniqueness of solutions, the phase line and bifurcations for first-order autonomous systems, and the phase plane for two-dimensional autonomous systems. The techniques that we develop will be used to analyze models throughout the course.

What constraints are poor households subject to? What is the scope for policy interventions (implemented by the government, international organizations, or NGOs)? What policies have been tried out? Have they been successful? At the same time, you will discover modern empirical methods in economics, in particular Randomized Control Trials (RCTs). Throughout the course, we will expose you to all facets of empirical projects, from experimental design and ethical issues, to data collection and data analysis.You will have the chance to gain experience working with real data using software for statistical analysis during weekly assignments.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=46993</url></Course><Course><course_id>36398</course_id><title>Saving Schools, Mini-Course 1: History and Politics of U.S. Education</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>5</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Paul E. Peterson</instructor><school>School:  Harvard University</school><description>This mini-course seeks to answer the following question: How did a school system, once the envy of the world, stumble so that the performance in math, science, and reading of U.S. students at age 15 fell below that of students in a majority of the world’s industrialized nations? Exploring that question, we identify the personalities and historical forces—the progressives, racial desegregation, legalization and collective bargaining—that shaped and re-shaped U.S. school politics and policy. We visit the places where new ideas and practices were spawned, and we look at some of their unanticipated consequences. In the three subsequent mini-courses, we seek answers to a second question: What are the best ways of lifting the performance of American schools to a higher level? To explore these questions, we look at ideas and proposals of those who want to save our schools—be it by reforming the teaching profession, holding schools accountable, or giving families more school choices. In interviews with reform proponents and independent experts, we capture the intensity of the current debate. In the end, we do not find any silver bullets that can magically lift schools to a new level of performance, but we do pinpoint the pluses and minuses of many new approaches. These three subsequent mini-courses will launch later in the fall and continue into 2016. Each mini-course contains five to eight lectures, with each lecture containing approximately three videos. The mini-courses also include assigned readings, discussion forums, and assessment opportunities. This is the first mini-course in a four-course sequence.

At this time, there aren’t enough good jobs or educational opportunities in the U.S. or globally to meet the aspirations and needs of all who want and need to work or to deliver on the expectation that every generation should achieve a higher standard of living for themselves and their families than their parent’s generation. This is a fundamental ideal that drives people all over the world. In the U.S. we call it the American Dream. If we take the right actions we can shape the future of work in ways that meet the needs of workers, families, and their economies and societies. To do so we first have to understand how the world of work is changing, how firms can compete and prosper and support good jobs and careers, and how to update the policies and practices governing the world of work. In this business and management course, we’ll start by tracing the history of work and employment that has made the economy work so well in the past. And we’ll uncover what’s gone wrong, in order to figure out new solutions that fit today’s workforce, economy, and society. We’ll also take you on a personal journey. You’ll learn what employers expect in today’s world of work – the skills, flexibility, and knowledge that are crucial for success in the contemporary workplace. We’ll examine what has to happen in order for employers, workers, governments, and regulators to come together to forge new policies, rules, and understandings for governing the world of work in the 21st century. We’ll make this all come alive by highlighting the experiences, contributions, and aspirations of real people who are working right now to address these challenges. So join us, and let’s get started on shaping the future of work.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=45168</url></Course><Course><course_id>34593</course_id><title>The Einstein Revolution</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>5</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Peter Galison , Ion Mihailescu</instructor><school>School:  Harvard University</school><description>Albert Einstein has become the icon of modern science. Following his scientific, cultural, philosophical, and political trajectory, this course aims to track the changing role of physics in the 20th and 21st centuries. This history course addresses Einstein's engagement with relativity, quantum mechanics, Nazism, nuclear weapons, philosophy, the arts, and technology, and raises basic questions about what it means to understand physics in its broader history.   Participants in the course will follow seventeen lessons, each of which will present a mix of science (no prerequisites!) and the broader, relevant cultural surround.  Some weeks will examine the physics concepts, while others will see excerpts of films or discuss modernist poetry that took off from relativity. Or we might be looking at the philosophical roots and philosophical consequences of Einstein’s works.  At other times we will be fully engaged with historical and political questions: the building, dropping, and proliferation of nuclear weapons, for example.    Typically, in a lesson (about an hour of streamed material), there will be opportunities for individual mini-essay writing, some multiple choice questions to bolster your understanding of the science, and a group activity which might one week be a debate and another a collective commentary on elements of an artwork from 1920s Weimar Germany.    HarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code : https://www.edx.org/edx-terms-service.

This course provides an introduction to traditional Chinese ethical thought and focuses on the pervasive contrast in the way Chinese and Westerners think about ethical guidance or guidance concerning what is right and what is wrong, good or bad.  Traditional Western orthodoxy uses the metaphor of a law – in its most familiar popular form, the command of a supernatural being backed by a threat of eternal punishment or reward – to explain ethical guidance. The Classical Chinese philosophers by contrast were all naturalists. They talked about ethical guidance using a path metaphor – a natural dào. We will look at two rival directions this natural dào model took in ancient China. The first direction views ethical paths as generated from human sources such as human history and past social practices. The other Confucian version views guidance as arising from a distinctly human guiding organ, something like a combination of our faculties of heart and mind. This organ issues the right/wrong or this/not-that judgements naturally. This internal map to moral choices branches, like a plant, as we mature. The alternative to human-based naturalism in China treated normative guidance as natural in a broader sense, such as the dào of water or one guided by what is beneficial vs harmful. Finally, we will take a brief look at a development after the classical period that resulted from the invasion of the more super-naturalist, Indo-European way of thinking about guidance – Medieval Chinese Buddhism. Although Chinese concepts will be the focus of our discussion, all the content of this course is intended to be accessible to beginner students. For those who are beginners in Philosophy, we will include a brief introduction to the ideas of logic that further shape the Western metaphor of a law and help us understand its role in Western ethics, science and psychology so you can better understand the different ways these two philosophical metaphors explain where norms of behaviour come from, what they are about and why they are important.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=35927</url></Course><Course><course_id>14128</course_id><title>Artificial Intelligence</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>6</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Dan Klein, Pieter Abbeel</instructor><school>School:  Berkeley</school><description>Artificial intelligence is already all around you, from web search to video games.

Dower, Andrew Gordon, Shigeru Miyagawa, Gennifer Weisenfeld</instructor><school>School:  Harvard University</school><description>This MIT and Harvard co-taught course examines Japanese history and uncovers the skills and questions involved in reading history through digital imagery. The introductory module considers methodologies historians use to “visualize” the past, followed by three modules that explore the themes of Westernization, in Commodore Perry’s 1853-54 expedition to Japan; social protest, in Tokyo’s 1905 Hibiya Riot; and modernity, as seen in the archives of the major Japanese cosmetics company, Shiseido. The course will cover the following topics in four modules: Module 0: Introduction: New Historical Sources for a Digital Age (Professors Dower, Gordon, Miyagawa). Digitization has dramatically altered historians' access to primary sources, making large databases of the visual record readily accessible. How is historical methodology changing in response to this seismic shift? How can scholars, students, and the general public make optimal use of these new digital resources? Module 1: Black Ships - Samurai (Professor Dower). Commodore Matthew Perry's 1853-54 expedition to force Japan to open its doors to the outside world is an extraordinary moment to look at by examining and comparing the visual representations left to us by both the American and Japanese sides of this encounter. This module also addresses the rapid Westernization undertaken by Japan in the half century following the Perry mission. Module 2: Social Protest in Imperial Japan: The Hibiya Riot of 1905 (Professor Gordon). The dramatic daily reports from participants in the massive "Hibiya Riot" in 1905, the first major social protest in the age of "imperial democracy" in Japan, offer a vivid and fresh perspective on the contentious domestic politics of an emerging imperial power. Module 3: Modernity in Interwar Japan: Shiseido - Consumer Culture (Professors Dower, Gordon, Weisenfeld). Exploring the vast archives of the Shiseido cosmetics company opens a fascinating window on the emergence of consumer culture, modern roles for women, and global cosmopolitanism from the 'teens through the 1920s and even into the era of Japanese militarism and aggression in the 1930s. This module will also tap other Visualizing Cultures units on modernization and modernity. The course is based on the MIT "Visualizing Cultures" website devoted to image-driven research on Japan and China since the 19th century (visualizingcultures.mit.edu).

How would you disprove the stance that man-made global warming is just an “opinion”? How would you explain your opinion on school tests, budget cuts, crime, immigration, safety and security issues?  No doubt that your persuasiveness relies on your arguments. But your ability to influence and convince critically depends on the way you frame your message. In today’s world, you often need to reduce a complex reality to a concise and convincing message. Framing is an approach that deals with the way we convey our message: our words, images, and metaphors. To take one basic characteristic, a good frame engages the listeners’ values and emotions – it is easy to remember and it is something that people will usually agree with intuitively. When you enter into a debate, you might be faced with frames of your opponents – and you will have to reframe the debate. This game of framing and reframing makes the debate to look like a chessboard made out of words. Of course, politicians play this game, trying to pull the debate towards their own words and metaphors in order to win their audience. But the game can be found everywhere: in the world of business, science, media – even at home. We invite you to join our journey of learning the game of framing and reframing. You will discover how this game is played, and how you can play it yourself.  This course suits people who are engaged with and interested in public and political debates. Not only people from the public sector will find it useful, but also engineers, consultants, managers and anyone who wants to make an impact in discussions and debates.

Schools are recognizing the potential for technology to transform teaching and learning. However, bringing technology into the classroom in a productive way is easier said than done. How do educators and others decide what kind and type of educational technology to use in the classroom? Which stakeholders influence that decision? What factors determine the success or failure of educational technology initiatives? How do we determine if these implementations are successful?  This course provides a practical overview for selecting, integrating, implementing, and evaluating educational technology initiatives in formal educational settings, primarily in the US. It will include the perspectives of stakeholders that make such initiatives possible, and consider how to evaluate for efficacy. The audience for this course includes current and future teachers, entrepreneurs, developers, practitioners, and leaders in educational technology.  Through four units over seven weeks, participants will develop an awareness and understanding of the “ecosystem” surrounding the implementation of educational technology in a formal educational setting. Participants will work towards creating a final project that synthesizes the main ideas from the course. </description><url>/enroll?course_id=45469</url></Course><Course><course_id>35934</course_id><title>I "Heart" Stats: Learning to Love Statistics</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>6</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Dan Myers</instructor><school>School:  University of Notre Dame</school><description>When you meet a new person, it is hard to know what to expect.  You may not be able to read the person or understand what they mean. Even if you want to have a good relationship with them, this lack of understanding can make interactions tense, unpredictable and scary! The same is true for a lot of people as they encounter statistics and mathematical ways of working with data.  Statistics can be confusing and opaque.  Symbols, Greek letters, very large and very small numbers, and how to interpret all of this can leave to feeling cold and disengaged—even fearful and resentful. But in the modern information age, having a healthy relationship with statistics can make life a whole lot easier. We are constantly faced with an onslaught of data and claims about it—from news articles, to Facebook and blog posts, casual and professional conversations, reports at our workplace, advertising, and claims from politicians and public officials. How can we process that information, make sense of it, evaluate truth claims, and put ourselves in a position to act on the information?  One of the most important ways is by befriending statistics and consistently using statistical ways of thinking.   The purpose of this course, then is to help you develop a functional, satisfying, and useful life-long relationship with statistics. To achieve that goal, we will take a non-technical approach—you will learn how statistics work and why they are so helpful in evaluating the world of information that is around us. You will learn about the logic of statistical thinking and the concepts (rather than the mathematical details and probability theory) that guide statistical inferences and conclusions.   You do not need to be a math whiz to take this course. If you can add, subtract, multiply, and divide (or just be able to use a calculator to do that!), you will be more than able to handle what will happen as this relationship develops. By the end of the course you will be able to:   Identify the most important features of a data set Select a statistical test based on the features of the data Think like a statistical detective Understand the relationship between two different characteristics or variables Perform some simple statistical calculations and draw some conclusions from real data Hopefully, love stats!  We’ll do all of this using entertaining examples related to real-life situations we all encounter in everyday life.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=35934</url></Course><Course><course_id>14125</course_id><title>Agile Development Using Ruby on Rails - Advanced</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>6</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Armando Fox, David Patterson, Sam Joseph</instructor><school>School:  Berkeley</school><description>Part 2 of the UC Berkeley Agile Development Using Ruby on Rails XSeries Program will teach you to use JavaScript to enhance applications and create more sophisticated apps by adding relationships between models within the Ruby on Rails framework. You will also learn about what happens after the apps are deployed to real users, including how to monitor performance, identify and fix common performance problems, and avoid compromising customer data. Finally, learners will see how to apply Agile techniques to enhance and refactor legacy code and practice app deployment to real users to monitor performance, identify and fix common performance problems, and avoid compromising customer data.    Other topics covered in this software engineering course include: How to form, organize and manage small programming teams Introduction to design patterns: what they are and how to recognize opportunities to apply them Using Rails for more advanced features like third-party authentication and elegantly expressing design patterns that arise frequently in SaaS There will be three homework assignments: two programming assignments and one assignment about operations/deployment. There will also be several short quizzes.

The challenge is how to deliver—how to create new practices, build new institutions, implement new policies, and transform incentives to sustain transformation and achieve sustainability. This course is about the “hows” of generating institutional change in hard places. Each week we focus on a different kind of challenge. You will read a case study, examine a problem in detail, help create a “solutions" toolkit, and then apply these insights to a second case. The course introduces concepts and insights from applied political economy and the science of delivery. Topics include: Reducing delay, error, and diversion of funds in citizen services Using citizen monitoring and community-driven projects to improve services in rural areas Preventing conflicts of interest or self-dealing from blocking institutional reform; building trust and community and changing public expectations Overcoming capacity traps (what to do when brain drain, political turbulence, or other problems de-skill government) Facilitating coordination at the cabinet level Developing a strategy and the incentives to sustain change. Drawn from actual experience around the world, each case starts with the problems a reform leader faced and traces the steps taken to address these. You will have a chance to assess the process and decide whether the solutions might work in your own context, as well as offer new proposals. Through quizzes and open response assignments, you will be able to share ideas with others and practice what you have learned. No certificates, statements of accomplishment, or other credentials will be awarded in connection with this course.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=48812</url></Course><Course><course_id>34574</course_id><title>Product Design: The Delft Design Approach</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>5</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Jaap Daalhuizen, Annemiek van Boeijen</instructor><school>School:  Delft University of Technology</school><description>Do you want to learn how to design?

Peterson</instructor><school>School:  Harvard University</school><description>This mini-course focuses on alternatives to public schools in the United States. There has been a rapid expansion of school choice in U.S. education. Charter schools now serve over five percent of the public school population, voucher programs have been introduced in many states, and digital education has captured the attention of educators across the country. What is the theoretical basis for these innovations? How effective are the early initiatives? How do parents decide what is best for their children? And how do all of these options affect the students who remain in traditional public schools? With the help of several scholars and participants in these new ventures, we will discuss the ways in which these school choice initiatives are re-shaping U. S. education. This mini-course contains five lectures, with most lectures divided into three videos. The mini-courses also includes assigned readings, discussion forums, and assessments. This is the fourth mini-course in a four-course sequence.

You may register for this course and peruse the content at your own pace, but at this time you may not pursue a certificate. How can Iran be stopped from getting a nuclear bomb—negotiations, sanctions, or military action? As a participant in this course, you will advise the president in deciding whether, and how, the U.S. should act. Once you’ve made your assessment, you will move on to wrestle with other scenarios preoccupying policy makers. Between the Assad regime and ISIS, civilians in Syria and Iraq face unimaginable atrocities. Should the U.S. intervene? China’s rise is rattling capitalist economies and a half-century of Pacific peace. What counterbalancing actions should Washington take? Leaks are a fact of life — but why do they happen? Who gets them, and why? Should journalists publish or withhold them? Does legal accountability lie with the leaker—or the journalist? This six-week course casts you as advisors on the hardest decisions any president has to make. We will go behind the veil to see the dynamic between the press and the U.S. government, to explore these dilemmas. We will also have to contend with the reality that government secrets rarely stay that way. Participants will learn to navigate the political landscape of an era in which private remarks become viral tweets, and mistakes by intelligence agencies become front-page stories. Weekly assignments require strategic thinking: Analyzing dynamics of challenges and developing strategies for addressing them.  Students will learn to summarize their analyses in a succinct “Strategic Options Memo,” combining careful analysis and strategic imagination with the necessity to communicate to major constituencies in order to sustain public support. They will also examine how policymaking is affected by constant, public analysis of government deliberations.   Ways to take this course From this page, you may register to view the content for the Open version of this course.

The course begins with Puritan poets--some orthodox, some rebel spirits--who wrote and lived in early New England. Focusing on Anne Bradstreet, Edward Taylor, and Michael Wigglesworth, among others, we explore the interplay between mortal and immortal, Europe and wilderness, solitude and sociality in English North America. Led by Harvard Professor Elisa New, Poetry in America surveys nearly 400 years of American poetry. Through video lectures, archival images and texts, expeditions to historic sites, interpretive seminars with large and small groups, interviews with poets and scholars, and conversations about poems with distinguished Americans, Poetry in America embarks on a journey through the literature of a nation. Distinguished guests, including President Bill Clinton, Elena Kagan, Henry Louis Gates, Eve Ensler, John McCain, Andrea Mitchell, Michael Pollan, Drew Faust, Tony Kushner, and Nas, among others, bring fresh perspectives to the study of American Poetry.

Ses trois représentants les plus connus, Corneille et Racine pour la tragédie et Molière pour la comédie comptent parmi les plus grands dramaturges européens de tous les temps, et Molière reste l’un des auteurs les plus joués dans le monde. Pour vous les faire découvrir, nous vous emmènerons dans l’environnement historique, sociologique, culturel et littéraire qui les a vu naître. Nous retracerons ainsi l’histoire du « théâtre moderne » depuis sa naissance au milieu du 16e siècle jusqu’aux plus brillantes années du «siècle de Louis XIV» (2e moitié du 17e siècle). Nous examinerons ainsi les fondements de l’expression «théâtre classique», les fondements du système qui a vu naître les « règles classiques », les fondements d’un dialogue théâtral qui repose entièrement sur « l’alexandrin classique ». Et nous ferons apparaître les tensions créatrices (entre la théorie et la pratique, entre les règles et le refus des règles, entre le texte et le spectacle, entre le classicisme et le baroque, entre la tragédie et l’opéra) qui ont façonné le théâtre de cette période. Enfin, en vous accompagnant dans la lecture des quelques chefs-d’œuvre qui ont créé une rupture esthétique et marqué les esprits, nous vous ferons pénétrer avec nous dans l’atelier créateur des plus grands dramaturges de l’âge d’or du théâtre français. Pièces de théâtre à lire: Le Cid et Cinna de Corneille / Les Précieuses ridicules, L’École des femmes et Tartuffe de Molière / Andromaque et Phèdre de Racine.

We then introduce statistical modeling and how it is applied to high-throughput data. In particular, we will discuss parametric distributions, including binomial, exponential, and gamma, and describe maximum likelihood estimation. We provide several examples of how these concepts are applied in next generation sequencing and microarray data. Finally, we will discuss hierarchical models and empirical bayes along with some examples of how these are used in practice. We provide R programming examples in a way that will help make the connection between concepts and implementation. Given the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you. If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology lectures. Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty relatively quickly across the first three courses. By the third course will be teaching advanced statistical concepts such as hierarchical models and by the fourth advanced software engineering skills, such as parallel computing and reproducible research concepts. The courses in this series will be released sequentially each month and are self-paced: PH525.1x: Statistics and R for the Life Sciences PH525.2x: Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra PH525.3x: Statistical Inference and Modeling for High-throughput Experiments PH525.4x: High-Dimensional Data Analysis PH525.5x: Introduction to Bioconductor: annotation and analysis of genomes and genomic assays  PH525.6x: High-performance computing for reproducible genomics PH525.7x: Case studies in functional genomics This class was supported in part by NIH grant R25GM114818.

Philosophers, scientists, artists, and poets overthrew our understanding of the physical world, of human behavior, of thought and its limits, and of art, creativity, and beauty. Scientific progress improved the way we lived across the world. Yet the last century also brought increased levels of war, tyranny, and genocide. Man pushed boundaries of good and evil, right and wrong, justice and injustice – and people lost faith in values. Now, thinkers and leaders are reconstructing theories of value and creating institutions to embody them.

To do this, he created calculus.  But he used a different coordinate system more appropriate for planetary motion.  We will learn to shift our perspective to do calculus with parameterized curves and polar coordinates. And then we will dive deep into exploring the infinite to gain a deeper understanding and powerful descriptions of functions. How does a computer make accurate computations? Absolute precision does not exist in the real world, and computers cannot handle infinitesimals or infinity. Fortunately, just as we approximate numbers using the decimal system, we can approximate functions using series of much simpler functions. These approximations provide a powerful framework for scientific computing and still give highly accurate results. They allow us to solve all sorts of engineering problems based on models of our world represented in the language of calculus.

Learn how to  create “world-ready” software from expert programmers who have developed international software for some of the world’s most successful companies. Developing international software involves far more than translating the User Interface. You must sharpen your business acumen to determine whether shipping software to a specific market is even worth the effort. You must deepen your knowledge of cultural differences so you don’t include a feature, visual, or turn of phrase that offends potential customers. You must understand that differences in language affect input methods, sorting orders, text layout, fonts, and dialog box sizes, and that countries use different currency symbols, number formats, keyboard layouts, and measurement systems--and you should internalize all of this before you write a single line of code. In this era of rapid development and intense competition, it is tempting to focus on what’s “most important” first, leaving the rest for later; but waiting until the end of the software development cycle to start thinking about markets outside of your own is a strategy that can result in delays or embarrassing failures, costing you time and money, alienating potential customers, and damaging your brand. In this course, programmers who have developed international software for some of the world’s most successful companies will teach you the secrets to creating a “world-ready” software design and codebase that will make shipping software to markets around the world a smoother, less expensive, and less time-consuming process. The course has three discrete sections: business considerations, design, and development. No previous programming knowledge is necessary for Part 1. Parts 2 and 3 require an understanding of basic coding techniques.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=47045</url></Course><Course><course_id>29216</course_id><title>Entrepreneurship 102: What can you do for your customer?</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>3</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Bill Aulet</instructor><school>School:  MIT</school><description>Ask not what your customer can do for you – ask what you can do for your customer. In Entrepreneurship 101, you’ve learned to look at the world through the eyes of the customer – and ah, what a great perspective it is! But the journey doesn’t stop there.

Cavadini</instructor><school>School:  University of Notre Dame</school><description>The Bible says that Jesus was identified as God's beloved son at his baptism. The same identification was made about Israel in the Old Testament and the disciples of Christ at their baptism. The striking similarity of these titles establishes a tight interrelationship between the people Israel, the person of Jesus Christ, and the church.   In this course, we will explore how a close reading of the book of Genesis, the Gospels, and early Christian writers can shed further light on these relationships and, in so doing, deepen our understanding of the figure of Jesus Christ.  Unlike many other treatments, this course does not presume that Jesus’ character can be plumbed solely by an examination of the Gospel stories. The witness of the Jewish scriptures and the lives of the saints are also important sources for this task.   The course will be eight weeks in length and organized around three topical questions: Who is Israel? (primary source material: the book of Genesis) Who is Jesus? (primary source material: the Gospels and the Creeds) Who is the Church? (primary source material: a selection of post-Biblical Christian writers)   No matter what your background in the study of theology, this course will provide a fresh approach to the identify of Jesus Christ that will reveal how the church has explored the unmeasurable depths of his person.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=36014</url></Course><Course><course_id>50070</course_id><title>PH556X: Practical Improvement Science in Health Care: A Roadmap for Getting Results</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>3</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Don Goldmann, Dave Williams, Don Berwick</instructor><school>School:  Harvard University</school><description>Developed through a collaboration between HarvardX and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, PH 556x: Practical Improvement Science in Health Care: A roadmap for getting results will provide learners with the valuable skills and simple, well-tested tools they need to translate promising innovations or evidence into practice. A group of expert faculty will explore a scientific approach to improvement — a practical, rigorous methodology that includes a theory of change, measurable aims, and iterative, incremental small tests of change to determine if improvement concepts can be implemented effectively in practice. Faculty will present this science through the lens of improving health and health care, but will also share examples of how improvement can (and does) influence our daily lives. Each week, learners will dive into engaging, interactive materials and relevant resources to start building an improvement toolkit that will serve them long after the six-week course ends. Learners will immediately put their new skills to the test as they work each week on a personal improvement project that will show them the power of the science that has improved healthcare — and other industries — around the world for decades. The only prerequisite for the course is curiosity, but the reward is a lifetime of improvement.   This collaboration between the Institute of Healthcare Improvement and HarvardX will teach you the skills and tools of improvement science to make positive changes in health, healthcare, and your daily life.

Tzvi Langermann presents a case study that builds from a unique 15th-century volume in which three important medical manuscripts in Hebrew and Judeo-Arabic (Arabic in Hebrew characters) are sewn together. He will not only walk the student through the basics of medical knowledge training and practice in the Jewish Middle Ages and beyond, but he will also show how clues gleaned from the particular elements of a manuscript (such as marginal notes, mistakes, and handwriting) allow us to learn a great deal that we could not have gleaned from a pristine printed version. The course is made up of eight short video lectures (5-7 minutes each) that explore the fascinating highlights of an extraordinary manuscript. While no previous knowledge is required, this course will be of most interest to advanced students of Jewish and medieval medicine studies in that it introduces a rare and fascinating medical text from the University of Pennsylvania’s manuscript collections.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=69208</url></Course><Course><course_id>47686</course_id><title>Modern Japanese Architecture: From Meiji Restoration to Today</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>1</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  David B.

New building materials and construction methods reflected changing times, and the radical contrast between tradition and modernism in the nation was clearly visible in architecture throughout Japan. After exploring the intense Westernization Japan experienced to rival the world’s developed countries, we will turn to look at how Japanese architects developed their own version of Modernism. Initially, Japanese wanted to pursue the discoveries of the Franco-Swiss Le Corbusier and of Walter Gropius at the German Bauhaus. But soon, Japan also began to produce its own 20th-century architects and develop its own style. Following World War II, Kenzo Tange became the first Japanese architect in history to achieve international fame. Lastly, we will mount an interview-based case study titled “Exploring Tokyo Tech’s Twenty-First Century O-okayama Campus.” Tokyo Institute of Technology (aka Tokyo Tech) possesses its own unique and unbroken succession of architects and a campus consisting of their buildings. We will learn about Kazuo Shinohara, one of the most prominent Japanese designers of the second half of the 20th century, and several of his renowned disciples from Tokyo Tech. This course aims to illustrate the present state of Japanese Modernist and postmodern building, as well as the distance covered over the past 150 years, including the 130-year history of Tokyo Tech itself. Join us on this journey through time as we examine and admire Japan’s architecture to better understand Japanese history. </description><url>/enroll?course_id=47686</url></Course><Course><course_id>32034</course_id><title>"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus" by Shelley: BerkeleyX Book Club</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>1</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Maggie Sokolik</instructor><school>School:  Berkeley</school><description>This literature course will explore Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley’s 1818 horror classic, Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus. This novel is remarkable for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that Shelley wrote the novel when she was only 18 years old. Frankenstein is a representation of both the Gothic and Romantic movements, and is often considered to be one of the earliest novels of science fiction as well. This story has had a huge influence on literature and popular culture, and has generated many adaptations in the forms of movies and plays.  The first film adaptation, in fact, appeared in 1910. Participants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion. Course materials will include background information for understanding the text, as well as vocabulary and language support. Assessment will include quizzes and short writing assignments.   This is the third part of the BerkeleyX Book Club offerings.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=32034</url></Course><Course><course_id>42209</course_id><title>"Call of the Wild" by London: BerkeleyX Book Club</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>1</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Maggie Sokolik</instructor><school>School:  Berkeley</school><description>The Call of the Wild is a 1903 novel written by Jack London. The story is set in the Yukon, the far northern territory of Canada/Alaska, during the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush. During this period, good sled dogs were in high demand. The novel's main character is a dog named Buck, who lives on a California ranch. London himself lived nearly a year in the Yukon, collecting material for the novel. Like many older popular novels, The Call of the Wild was serialized in the Saturday Evening Post in the summer of 1903. A month later, it was released as a  book. The novel’s great popularity and success made London famous. The appeal of this story comes from its simplicity as a tale of survival. As early as 1908, the story was adapted to film. Since then, there have been other adaptations. Participants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion. Course materials will include background information for understanding the text, as well as vocabulary and language support.

Once you have initially configured your Microsoft Windows Server storage you will want to take advantage of three key features: iSCSI Storage, Storage Spaces and Data Deduplication. iSCSI is a protocol that supports remote access to SCSI-based storage devices over a TCP/IP network. It provides and easy to use alternative to Storage Area Networks (SANs) and can use existing infrastructure. Storage Spaces lets you group physical disks together and present them as a single logical disk. This makes it easy to manage and dynamically allocate storage. Data Deduplication is a service that identifies and removes duplications within data. The goal of Data Deduplication is to maximize the use of disk space. This course follows INF201.21, Implementing Microsoft Windows Server Disks and Volumes but it is not required.

Sadly, the majority of Dante’s readers do not accompany him beyond his escape from the Inferno, in part, perhaps, because of an instinctive anticipation that when the excitement of adventure is over, then the hard work of maturation must begin. Indeed, there is work aplenty on Mount Purgatorio, but there is also so much more. There is day and night, labor and rest, waking and dreaming, all the rhythms of diurnal living; but above all, there is the delight of hope. All that the penitent souls suffer here, they undergo in the eagerness of passionate yearning to be healed of the wounds of sin inflicted on them as part of the universal heritage of humanity. Purgatory is a “school of contemplation,” where the healing of wounds coincides with learning to suffer the weight of responsibility for one’s own identity as a person. For those willing to undertake the steep ascent of Dante’s seven-story Mountain, nowhere in the legacy of human culture is the process of becoming a “whole person” more closely observed or rendered with deeper psychological and social insight than in the cantos of Dante’s Purgatorio. For us as modern readers, Mount Purgatorio is a steep ascent indeed, and if fewer of us accept this challenging invitation than do for the careen through Hell, then it should come as no surprise for us to learn of the untold years, centuries perhaps, that the souls whom Dante meets there require to complete their climb. A realistic willingness to suffer consciously and voluntarily, motivated by authentic hope, is hardly recognized as a possibility by most of us today for whom security and prosperity are accepted as the unqualified goals of our striving. Even to consider an alternative of the sort which Dante offers us in the Purgatorio is already a notable achievement, but one which the imaginative power of Dante’s poetry here places within our reach. Do not let the opportunity pass you by. In this course, you will be asked to participate in learning activities on both edX and on MyDante, an innovative platform for deep reading that emphasizes mindfulness and contemplative reading habits as key to deriving lasting meaning from poetic texts. The pedagogical approach of the course goes beyond mere academic commentary on the poem as literature; it introduces the reader to a way of thinking about the meaning of the poem at a personal level. This module is the second of three modules that compose the full course. A module on the Vita Nuova and Inferno will launch on October 15, 2014, and the concluding module on Paradiso will launch in April 2015. This course features Robert and Jean Hollander's contemporary translations of Dante Alighieri's Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso, permission courtesy of The Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, a division of Random House LLC. The print editions contain valuable notes and commentary which are highly recommended as companions to the course materials.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=34583</url></Course><Course><course_id>46931</course_id><title>The Book: Making and Meaning in the Medieval Manuscript</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>1</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Jeffrey F. Hamburger</instructor><school>School:  Harvard University</school><description>As books “go digital,” we can appreciate what is gained in terms of convenience, accessibility and interconnectedness. However, we should also consider what is lost as texts transition to a digital sphere. This module of The Book: Histories Across Time and Space seeks to re-introduce learners to the codex – a handwritten and hand-constructed book - as a three-dimensional object whose characteristics produce meaning in the experience of the reader. This module is designed to walk you through the process of making a medieval manuscript. Using a wide variety of examples from the collections of Harvard’s Houghton Library, it will familiarize you with basic terms and concepts and give you a “feel” for the shapes, sizes, formats, materials and considerations of craft that went into the making of the book as we know it. Throughout the Middle Ages there existed an intimate relationship between making and meaning. Codices were tactile as well as visual objects designed to engage multiple senses. In the illuminated manuscript, it is often impossible to distinguish neatly between text and image; rather, letters assume imagistic forms and images take the form of letters. Bookmakers were sensitive to the interplay of materials, from the parchment of the pages to the wooden boards, designed to protect the contents. Each of these elements conditioned a reader’s interaction with the book. Bookmaking required a significant material investment. The production process was laborious and lengthy, involving many separate stages and craftsmen. Books participated in a wide range of ritual, liturgical, devotional, educational and practical contexts, each of which in turn conditioned the presentation and reception of both their form and content.

How much control should we have over how and when we die? When does medical treatment turn into medical enhancement — and should we care? Is rationing health care good, bad, necessary — or all of the above? This course will explore fundamental moral issues that arise in medicine, health, and biotechnology. Get behind the headlines — and polarized debates — and join others who want to think deeply and openly about these problems. Some are as old as life itself: the vulnerability of illness, the fact of death. Some are new, brought on by a dizzying pace of technology that can unsettle our core ideas about human nature and our place in the world. And nearly all intersect with issues of racial and gender equality, as well as policies affecting the world’s most vulnerable populations. Designed to introduce students to the range of issues that define bioethics, together with core concepts and skills, this course should be of interest to undergraduates, health care professionals, policy makers, and anyone interested in philosophy or ethics.

Martínez-Dávila</instructor><school>School:  Universidad Carlos III de Madrid</school><description>This history course delves into the medieval history of the city of Burgos, from its inception in 884 c.e. as the homeland of the Spanish Kingdom of Castile and Leon, until the completion of the Spanish Reconquista in 1492. We will study complicated legendary heroes like Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, “The Cid”, both a champion of the Christian Reconquista and a friend of Islamic rulers, who lays buried in the Cathedral of Burgos. Like the Cid, medieval Burgos presented two competing views for Spain’s future – one centered on overt Castilian supremacy and another more nuanced one that incorporated religious minorities, especially Jews and Jewish converts to Christianity (conversos), into every element of political, economic, and even religious life. This course will investigate the disastrous impact of the Plague and how it led to the death of King Alfonso XI and the ruinous civil war between the half-brothers, Pedro “The Cruel” and Enrique II of Trastamára. We will also appraise the collapse of the kingdom’s “Old Christian” nobility and the generation of new elite clans, some of whom hailed from Jewish ancestries. It was also the era of anti-Jewish pogroms, Christian fixations on “blood purity” and unsuccessful pleas for Christian harmony, and the last gasps of Jewish, Christian, and Muslim coexistence. We will virtually-tour the Cathedral of Burgos, the Museum of Burgos, and what remains of the city’s medieval neighborhoods and structures. We will also study and transcribe intriguing vellum and paper manuscripts from the cathedral and municipal archives so that we discover new facets of this history. No knowledge of Spanish is needed to participate in the course or in our transcription efforts.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=68083</url></Course><Course><course_id>50004</course_id><title>Cálculo Diferencial</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>1</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Eduardo Suger</instructor><school>School:  Galileo University</school><description>Podemos afirmar sin temor a equivocarnos que un buen curso de Cálculo amplía la visión del estudiante en su campo y en su área de estudio, que no pertenece necesariamente al área de física o matemática, por ejemplo en fisiología para estudiantes de medicina.

Por otro lado la agresión al medio ambiente y el cambio climático  y  la necesidad de atender los requerimientos  de agentes económicos y sociales reclaman su derecho a desempeñar el rol que les corresponde. Emergen tendencias como la Responsabilidad Social Corporativa, vinculada a procesos de reporte estandarizado, como el que marca Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) y a mejoras en los esquemas de Gobernanza Corporativa, necesarias para armonizar los distintos ecosistemas tanto sociales como empresariales y ambientales garantizando la legítima participación de todas las partes interesadas y equiparando la información generada a la financiera a la hora de tomar decisiones. En este escenario, los activos utilizados tanto por gobiernos como empresas para desarrollar deben ser administrados de manera eficaz y eficiente para incrementar el valor de las organizaciones de manera incremental y continua garantizando principalmente  la sostenibilidad económico financiera de esas organizaciones. Dentro de esos activos, la información y la TI adquieren valor importantísimo para facilitar  las necesidades de transformación de las organizaciones y, especialmente gobernar y gestionar el uso adecuado de la TI tal como señala la norma ISO/IECE 38500. En cualquier caso, la implantación de éstas  tecnologías requiere un cambio profundo en la cultura de las organizaciones, públicas y privadas y la adopción de principios y políticas internas que impidan posibles perjuicios a todas las partes interesadas en el éxito de dichas organizaciones. La aplicación de las distintas normas mencionadas así como  renovación del concepto de Gobernanza Corporativa aplicada a los distintos activos y especialmente a la TI (dirección y control en el uso y gestión de los mismos) es uno de los grandes retos a los que se enfrenta hoy el mundo económico financiero así como la generación de conocimiento e inteligencia para resolver los graves problemas de nuestros días y en el futuro. Esta nueva forma de trabajar hará que las empresas sean más responsables, comprometidas, humanas,  productivas, y más eficaces y eficientes en el liderazgo, formación y aptitud personal así como un uso adecuado de la TI por parte de la organización.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=45230</url></Course><Course><course_id>36408</course_id><title>身边的营养学 | Nutrition Around You</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>1</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  许雅君 教授 | Ya-jun Xu</instructor><school>School:  Peking University</school><description>课程介绍视频可以访问这里。 欢迎选修北京大学医学部MOOC课程“身边的营养学”。 点击上方绿色按钮报名。 营养学是一门探讨人们在饮食生活实践中如何得到完满实现的理论、措施和方法的学科。营养学的发展与生命科学及社会意识形态的发展息息相关，随着人民群众对健康关注的日益增多，营养学也走进了每个人的生活。 在 这门“身边的营养学”网上课程中，我们将向您系统地讲授营养学的主要概念及方法。课程内容从营养学的基础开始，循序渐进，围绕蛋白质、脂类、碳水化合物、 膳食纤维、维生素、矿物质和水等几大营养素的特性和生理功能展开。进一步地，我们会利用生活中的实际案例，和您分享各类营养素的适宜摄入量、食物来源及与 常见慢性病的关系，教会您如何在全面理解各类食品的营养价值的基础上，将营养学基础知识与机体健康紧密结合，理论联系实际，解决生活中的实际膳食问题。 希望同学们通过本课程的学习，能够掌握营养学的基础知识及方法，了解膳食结构与健康及常见慢性病之间的关系，在改善自身营养状况和健康水平的同时，也能惠及身边的人，并为后续的研究和学习打下坚实的基础。 我们的课程主共有7周课，每周有两个时长为15~20分钟的课程视频，每一节课后有作业。学习者每周在此课程的投入时间需要1~2小时。 课程进行期间，助教组将于本课论坛开放学术讨论区与教务讨论区，供大家提出疑问，发表见解。教师和助教参与论坛活动安排：每周六晚上7~9点在线，欢迎大家积极参与。 本课程需要准备专门的教材么？ 不需要。本课程没有专门的教材，主要参考书目有：孙长颢主编的《营养与食品卫生学（第7版）》（人民卫生出版社）和李勇主编的《营养与食品卫生学》（北京大学医学出版社），感兴趣的同学可以参阅。另外，每节课后教师会给出针对当节课内容的参考资料，包括参考书、参考文献、参考网站以及视听材料，等。 关于本课程的考核方式 本课程每次课后会有作业。作业占总成绩50%（包括7次每周练习成绩和1次同学互评成绩），期末考核占总成绩50%。另外认真思考，积极参与论坛讨论，表现突出者，会结合表现给予1~5%成绩的奖励加分。本课程达到60%的成绩即为合格，由任课教师签发北大统一的课程结业证书。</description><url>/enroll?course_id=36408</url></Course><Course><course_id>34581</course_id><title>The Divine Comedy: Dante's Journey to Freedom, Part 3 (Paradiso)</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>1</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Frank Ambrosio, Rita Pearson, Jo Ann Moran Cruz, Elisabetta Lanzilao, Francesco Ciabattoni, Anthony DelDonna, Eddie Maloney</instructor><school>School:  Georgetown University</school><description>Turn back if you would see your shores again. Do not set forth upon the deep, for, losing sight of me, you would be lost. -Paradiso, Canto II, lines 4-6 Joy is the business of Paradiso, that much is clear; but could there be a more mysterious word in the whole realm of human imagination than “Joy?” “Joy” boggles the human imagination because it asks us to follow the vector of hope to its maximal extension and intention, until it arrives at that point which Dante locates “nel mezzo,” at the very center of everything, at that point where every centripetal and centrifugal force of both the physical universe of energy and the symbolic universe of creative imagination and meaning first arise and finally return. From beginning to end, the Pilgrim’s progress through Paradiso is enabled and guided by his enactment of the role to which he consented in the climactic episode of the Purgatorio in the garden of the Earthly Paradise. Now leaving Earth behind and beneath, the Pilgrim is transformed into the disciple; specifically, the disciple of Beatrice. She now becomes his true path, la diritta via, along which he gradually discovers the Joy that Christianity identifies as the hope of Resurrection. Dante’s Paradiso maps the physics of freedom, tracing a universal history of meaning. Just as there is a physics of matter and energy, there is a physics of freedom governing the evolutionary history of hope which directs the human search for meaning in every person’s life and in all human culture. In this universe, meaning functions as does light in the physical universe, acting as its absolute measure and enforcing its most basic law—the law of relational identity, where “all are responsible to all for all.” Like the principle of relativity in the physics of energy, relational identity means that each personal existence has historical reality only in relation to all other personal identities. Almost everyone agrees that the poetry of the Paradiso is sublime. Sublimity, however, is a highly rarefied and strenuously acquired taste. This is why Dante himself warns us in the second canto of the Paradiso that unless we have become used to eat the “bread of Angels,” we should turn back and not attempt to follow him on this final leg of his journey, and we as modern-day readers might well be tempted here to turn back as the Pilgrim himself was tempted in the second canto of the Inferno. But to paraphrase Virgil’s response then, which both encouraged and challenged, “Why be so afraid to reach for what your heart most hopes for; where else do you have to turn?” In this course, you will be asked to participate in learning activities on both edX and on MyDante, an innovative platform for deep reading that emphasizes mindfulness and contemplative reading habits as key to deriving lasting meaning from poetic texts. The pedagogical approach of the course goes beyond mere academic commentary on the poem as literature; it introduces the reader to a way of thinking about the meaning of the poem at a personal level.  This module is the third of three modules that compose the full course. A module on the Vita Nuova and Inferno will launch on October 15, 2014, and a module on Purgatorio will launch in February 2015. This course features Robert and Jean Hollander's contemporary translations of Dante Alighieri's Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso, permission courtesy of The Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, a division of Random House LLC. The print editions contain valuable notes and commentary which are highly recommended as companions to the course materials.  </description><url>/enroll?course_id=34581</url></Course><Course><course_id>34569</course_id><title>Cyber-Physical Systems</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>1</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Edward Lee, Jeff Jensen, Sanjit Seshia</instructor><school>School:  Berkeley</school><description>EECS149.1x introduces students to the design and analysis of cyber-physical systems --- computational systems that are integrated with physical processes.

He played major roles in 2 national events: the 1964 Tokyo Olympics and the 1970 Osaka Expo, but his work received criticism and rejection from younger generations who sought and pursued new trajectories. Through working to surpass previous generations, the discipline of architecture became intensely contested and engaged. As a result, unique approaches towards addressing architectural problems were established, thus contributing to an understanding of contemporary Japanese architecture as differentiated from architecture in the rest of the world. In the half-century period after Tange, social conditions in Japan changed radically - domination of the global economy due to the collapse of the bubble economy, proliferation of information technology, population decline, the Great East Japan earthquake, and preparation for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. During this period of rapid change, what did leading Japanese architects think, and how did they produce their work? This course will explore four facets of contemporary Japanese architecture; theory, technology, city, and humans. The course will also span five generations of architects since Kenzo Tange. Through lectures by instructors and discussions with the most influential Japanese architects, the course will trace the development of contemporary Japanese architecture and will consider its future direction. In Part 1, we will focus on two of the four facets of Japanese architecture; theory and technology. The theory portion will feature discussions with architects who played a significant role in influencing the development of theoretical frameworks that contributed to guiding contemporary Japanese architecture. Terunobu Fujimori, Arata Isozaki, Hisao Kohyama, Hidetoshi Ohno, and Kazuyo Sejima will visit their buildings and discuss the ideas behind their respective works. The technology portion will focus on works by architects who explored the use of technology—from techniques used for traditional crafts to computational processes—as a vehicle for their investigations into the conceptualization and production of architecture. Tadao Ando, Shigeru Ban, Manabu Chiba, and Kazuhiko Namba will visit their buildings to discuss the ideas behind their respective works.  In Part 2, the following leading Japanese architects will discuss their work — Sou Fujimoto, Hiroshi Hara, Itsuko Hasegawa, Toyo Ito, Fumihiko Maki, Satoko Shinohara, Yoshiharu Tsukamoto, and Riken Yamamoto.

How can you motivate students to ask probing questions and seek complex answers? How can you bridge their historical knowledge with a lifelong commitment to civic action? With this course, middle and high school teachers will find new ways to engage students in and out of the classroom. Co-taught by Dr. Kathy Swan, Professor of Education at the University of Kentucky, and Naomi Coquillon, Manager of Youth and Teacher Programs at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History, this course will offer teachers useful and readily applicable strategies and tactics to incorporate inquiry-based learning methods into their existing history lessons. The course brings together the new College, Career and Civic Life (C3) Framework for Social Studies with the Smithsonian’s hands-on, museum-based educational techniques that bring historical artifacts to life for millions of visitors each year. Through explanation, demonstration, and dynamic examples, the course offers teachers practical ideas for how to entice students to craft complex and incisive questions; think critically about primary and secondary historical sources; form and support their opinions with evidence; and communicate their conclusions in ways that will prepare them to be engaged citizens of the world. Demonstrations will feature the Smithsonian National Museum of American History’s exhibitions and vast collection of historical artifacts and will offer ideas and resources to help teachers everywhere incorporate object- and inquiry-based teaching techniques and Smithsonian online resources into their own classrooms. Students who complete the course will have a portfolio comprised of three lesson seeds and one completed lesson plan that has been reviewed by the course instructors. Work for the course including completion of the portfolio will constitute 30 learning hours. Students who successfully complete this course will have the option of receiving grade reports as well as a letter of verification of completion from Smithsonian that they can present when applying for continuing education credit with their districts.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=69936</url></Course><Course><course_id>41550</course_id><title>"Dracula" by Stoker: BerkeleyX Book Club</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>1</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Maggie Sokolik</instructor><school>School:  Berkeley</school><description>This course will explore Bram Stoker’s 1897 classic vampire novel, Dracula, which is famous for introducing the vampire Count Dracula. This is the story of Dracula's move from Transylvania to England to find new blood and spread the curse of the undead. It also introduces the now-famous character of Professor Abraham Van Helsing. The novel Dracula is categorized in many different ways: vampire, horror, and gothic fiction. It also addresses concepts such as women in Victorian culture, colonialism, sexuality, and post-colonialism. Although Stoker was not the first writer to tell the story of a vampire, he is credited for giving the vampire its modern form. This story has been adapted to many different forms in film and theater. Participants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion. Course materials will include background information for understanding the text, as well as vocabulary and language support. Assessment will include quizzes and short writing assignments.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=41550</url></Course><Course><course_id>36400</course_id><title>Saving Schools, Mini-Course 3: Accountability and National Standards</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>1</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Paul E.

Mais négocier ce n’est pas se limiter à la recherche du bénéfice maximum. La négociation traverse toutes les dimensions de la vie humaine. Nous négocions tous les jours, dans toutes les sphères de notre existence : au travail, avec la famille, les amis… Dès qu’il s’agit de partager des biens matériels mais aussi de résoudre une divergence d’intérêts, de concilier différentes envies, rêves, goûts, couleurs…   Ce cours s’éloigne de l’approche classique des négociations et tente de rendre compte des phénomènes psychologiques à la base du comportement. L’approche poursuivie sera descriptive plutôt que prescriptive. Contrairement aux théoriciens du jeu qui « examinent ce que de super-hommes, ultra-intelligents et impeccablement rationnels devraient faire dans les situations compétitives », nous explorerons la façon dont « des êtres imparfaits se comportent dans la réalité » (Raïffa, 1982, p. 21). Ainsi, les êtres humains poursuivent des motivations, ont des attentes, des préjugés, des biais et des émotions. Ils analysent l’information qui leur est soumise et prennent des décisions à travers le spectre de leurs propres limites cognitives. Leurs actions fluctuent en fonction de la situation ou de leur personnalité. Toutes ces variables influencent non seulement le comportement des personnes mais, plus fondamentalement, elles modifient la dynamique même de résolution des divergences. Ce cours mettra en évidence ces variables multiples et offrira aux étudiants une compréhension fine et détaillée des processus psychologiques qui entrent en jeu avant, pendant et après toute négociation.   Ce cours sera enseigné en français.   Often confined to the study of techniques like selling a 24-volume encyclopedia to a recalcitrant octogenarian or to the art of haggling salary, negotiation is frequently approached from a purely utilitarian perspective. But motivations in negotiations are not limited to the pursuit of maximum profit. Negotiations concern all dimensions of human life. We negotiate every day, in all spheres of our lives: at work, with family, and with friends. We negotiate in attempts to share material goods, but also to solve divergence of interests, to reconcile different desires, dreams, tastes, and colors.   This course attempts to account for psychological phenomena at the basis of negotiation behaviors. Our approach will be descriptive rather than prescriptive. Unlike game theorists who “look at what ultra-smart and impeccably rational super-human beings should do in competitive situations,” we will explore how “imperfect beings behave in reality (Raïffa, 1982). Human beings pursue motivations, have expectations, show prejudice, display biases and emotions. They analyze information submitted to them and make decisions that are tainted by their cognitive limitations. Their actions fluctuate as a function of the situation they are embedded in, as well as their personality. All these variables influence not only the behavior of people, but more fundamentally, the very dynamic of negotiation instances. This course will highlight these multiple variables and offer students a detailed understanding of the psychological processes involved before, during, and after negotiation.   This course is taught in French.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=68056</url></Course><Course><course_id>35786</course_id><title>Comprendre la respiration</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>6</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Franck Verschuren</instructor><school>School:  Université catholique de Louvain</school><description>Pourquoi respirons-nous ?

While the development of cities in different parts of the world is moving in diverse directions, all estimations show that cities worldwide will change and grow strongly in the coming years. Especially in the tropics over the next 3 decades, it is expected that the number of new urban residents will increase by 3 times the population of Europe today. Yet already now, there is an extreme shortage of designers and urban planners able to understand the functioning of a city as a system, and to plan a sustainable and resilient city. To answer questions like: Which methods can contribute to the sustainable performance of a city, and how can we teach this to the next generations, the ETH Future Cities Laboratory in Singapore has produced over the last 3 years many necessary research results. “Future Cities” aims to bring these latest results to the places where they are needed most. The only way to better understand the city is by going beyond the physical appearance and by focusing on different representations, properties and impact factors of the urban system. For that reason, in this course we will explore the city as the most complex human-made “organism” with a metabolism that can be modeled in terms of stocks and flows. We will open a holistic view on existing and new cities, with a focus on Asia. Data-driven approaches for the development of the future city will be studied, based on crowdsourcing and sensing. At first, we will give an overview of the components and dynamics of the future cities, and we will show the importance of information and information architecture for the cities of the future. The course will cover the origins, state-of-the-art and applications of information architecture and simulation. “Future Cities” will provide the basis to understand, shape, plan, design, build, manage and continually adapt a city. You will learn to see the consequences of citizen science and the merging of Architecture and information space. You will be up-to-date on the latest research and development on how to better understand, create and manage the future cities for a more resilient urban world.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=20043</url></Course><Course><course_id>36345</course_id><title>Math in Sports</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>5</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Anne Pilkington, Michael Hildreth</instructor><school>School:  University of Notre Dame</school><description>In this course you will learn to use some mathematical tools that can help predict and analyze sporting performances and outcomes.

The EU is a major global actor in the field of human rights. EU treaties state that human rights are a fundamental value of the Union, which must be a silver thread in all its policies. The EU now acts within an impressive array of competences, and therefore has the potential to impact – positively or negatively – anyone’s human rights. This EU and Human Rights course teaches the basics of human rights, placing the EU at the centre of investigation. The course will examine a number of key questions: What factors are key to making the EU a positive or a negative force for human rights? An example is the economic crisis: what impact has it had on people’s human rights in the EU and the world? Which actors, friends or foes, must the EU engage with to successfully promote human rights? Examples include NGOs, businesses, or other international organisations like the Council of Europe or the United Nations. In key policy sectors in which the EU is active, what is on balance the impact of the EU? Examples include trade, development, migration, social policy or international crisis management. All of the course activities aim to improve your understanding of how the EU, alone or in combination with other local or global, state or non-state actors, can better promote and uphold human rights worldwide. The course is intended for anyone interested in human rights and the EU, human rights law, European law, European Studies, international relations, global governance, etc. It is divided into four modules: The EU and Human Rights: Value Promotion and Coherence Promoting Human Rights inside the EU Promoting Human Rights in EU External Action Capitalising on Success and Remedying Flaws This course is taught by leading academics, and the content is illustrated through interviews of practitioners in the field of the EU and human rights. The course also comprises a wealth of bibliographical resources, and frequent exercises to test what you have learned.

In this course, we will learn why this is the case by looking at the fundamental scientific principles underlying epidemics and the public health actions behind their prevention and control in the 21st century. This course covers these four topics: origins of novel pathogens; analysis of the spread of infectious diseases; medical and public health countermeasures to prevent and control epidemics; panel discussions involving leading public health experts with deep frontline experiences to share their views on risk communication, crisis management, ethics and public trust in the context of infectious disease control.  (1) Fauci AS, Touchette NA, Folkers GK.

Do you know computational methods but do not realize how they apply to biological problems? Do you know biology but do not understand how scientists really analyze complicated data? 7.QBWx: Quantitative Biology Workshop is designed to give students exposure to the application of quantitative tools to analyze biological data at an introductory level. For the last few years, the Biology Department of MIT has run this workshop-style course as part of a one-week outreach program for students from other universities. With 7.QBWx, we can give more students from around the world the chance to discover quantitative biology. We hope that this series of workshops encourages students to explore new interests and take more biology and computational courses. We expect that students from 7.00x Introduction to Biology – The Secret of Life or an equivalent course can complete this workshop-based course without a background in programming. The course content will introduce programming languages but will not teach any one language in a comprehensive manner. The content of each week varies. We want learners to have an introduction to multiple languages and tools to find a topic that they would want to explore more. Participants with programming experience will find some weeks easier than students with only biology experience, while those with a biology background should find the week on genetics easier. We recommend that students try to complete each week to find what interests them the most.

The tools and programming languages include MATLAB, PyMOL, StarGenetics, Python, and R. This course does not require learners to download MATLAB. All MATLAB activities run and are graded within the edX platform. We do recommend that participants download a few other free tools for the activities so that they learn how to use the same tools and programs that scientists use.  </description><url>/enroll?course_id=29217</url></Course><Course><course_id>69876</course_id><title>Gestión Participativa</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>5</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Juan A.

Comment faire les bons choix stratégiques ? Ce cours proposera des réponses à ces questions au travers de nombreuses études de cas. Il vous fournira des outils et méthodes d’analyse indispensables pour comprendre les atouts ainsi que l’environnement concurrentiel des entreprises. Il s’agit d’une approche originale qui s’adresse à chacun, qu’il soit directeur, cadre, entrepreneur, étudiant ou tout simplement désireux de savoir comment prendre des décisions réfléchies et cohérentes tout en poursuivant un objectif à long terme. Ce cours est construit comme un voyage en 6 escales au pays « stratégie ». Tout comme le stratège, le voyageur doit décider, prévoir et planifier son itinéraire en demeurant flexible. Il doit tenir un cap et connaître sa destination, car comme le disait Sénèque : « il n’est pas de vent favorable à qui ne connaît pas son port ». Why does one company succeed over another? How do you make the right strategic choices while developing your business?  This course will provide you with the tools and methods of analysis needed to answer these important questions. Through numerous case studies, you will come to understand both the assets of companies and their competitive environment. This is an original approach, applicable to everyone from students to business executives, but also anyone curious about how to make informed decisions while pursuing well-defined, long-term goals. The course takes a multi-faceted approach. As a strategist, you must decide, predict and plan your route while remaining flexible and open to change. You must stay the course and know your destination because, as the philosopher Seneca once said, “If one does not know to which port one is sailing, no wind is favourable.”</description><url>/enroll?course_id=69238</url></Course><Course><course_id>47008</course_id><title>How to Write a Novel – Writing the Draft</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>5</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Nancy Lee, Annabel Lyon</instructor><school>School:  University of British Columbia</school><description>Have you created an outline and now feel prepared to start writing your novel? Or have you started a novel draft only to find your interest or confidence waning? In this course, the international best-selling authors and professors from The University of British Columbia’s renowned MFA program introduce the essential fiction craft toolbox for writers struggling with the common hurdles of first drafts.  While ideas and inspiration are often enough to ignite interest in writing a novel, writers can quickly lose confidence, especially when their best efforts have inadvertently produced flat characters, waning conflicts, tangled plots and weak dialogue. Reaching your goal of writing (and perhaps, publishing) a novel requires an understanding of fiction’s deeper mechanics and a familiarity with the specific craft elements that will help translate your creativity and imagination into compelling paragraphs, scenes and chapters. Through writing exercises aimed at developing new skills, concrete examples from published novels, feedback and discussion with fellow writers and opportunities to identify and strengthen weaknesses in their own projects, learners will broaden their knowledge of fiction craft as they explore creating memorable characters, the art of scene design, tactics for managing unwieldy plots and steps for writing layered and meaningful dialogue. Whether you’re beginning your novel draft or nearing the end, this course is a unique opportunity to learn the essentials of strong fiction writing from award-winning authors sharing their proven methods and approaches. The course is recommended for professional and aspiring writers, writing groups, those participating in NaNoWriMo, teachers and anyone who has a novel in progress. FAQ Do I need to complete Part 1: Planning and Outlining to take this course? No. As long as you are in the process of writing a novel, this course will be valuable to you. Of course, we strongly recommend starting with an outline, as your novel writing process will be much more efficient, but it’s not required. Is this course related to an existing UBC writing class? This is an entirely new course, created by instructors with years of experience teaching the art of fiction writing to undergraduate and graduate university students as well as members of the community. What are the other courses in the series? How to Write a Novel – Part 1: Plan and Outline explores the core elements of fiction writing necessary to build an outline: a blueprint for a successful draft of your novel. How to Write a Novel – Part 3: Edit and Revise, is in the early stages of development. When it is launched, it will be suitable for students who have completed a full draft of their novel.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=47008</url></Course><Course><course_id>34603</course_id><title>Energy Subsidy Reform</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>5</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Nooman Rebei, Samah Mazraani, Luc Moers, Masahiro Nozaki, Kangni Roland Kpodar, Younes Zouhar, Kamil Dybczak , La-Bhus Fah</instructor><school>School:  The International Monetary Fund</school><description>Energy subsidies are an issue in practically every country in the world. Pre-tax subsidies, which arise when energy consumers pay less than the supply cost of energy, are high in many emerging and developing economies, and have risen in recent years. Although pre-tax subsidies are not a large enough problem in advanced economies to cause fiscal difficulties, these countries have tax subsidies, where the taxes imposed on energy are not high enough to account for all of the adverse effects of excessive energy consumption, including on the environment. The issue of energy subsidy reform is not new. Despite widespread recognition of their adverse consequences, energy subsidies have proven difficult to reform. This course builds an extensive cross-country analysis, which is reported in the recently published IMF book “Energy Subsidy Reform: Lessons and Implications,” to make recommendations on how to best implement reforms aimed at reducing state subsidies on energy. In the first part of the course, economists from the IMF will introduce the definition and measurement of subsidies, and then describe the economic, social, and environmental implications of subsidies. The second part of the course has two principal purposes: first, to review what works best in energy subsidy reform, in light of country experiences globally; and second, to illustrate successes and failures in particular country contexts by summarizing some case studies. Whether you are a civil servant working on economic issues for your country or simply interested in better understanding issues related to energy subsidies, this course will provide hands-on training on the design of successful reforms of energy subsidies. You are welcome to join us in this exciting course! Energy Subsidy Reform is offered by the IMF with financial support from the Government of Belgium.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=34603</url></Course><Course><course_id>51343</course_id><title>Introducción a la inversión bursátil</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>4</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Francisco Guijarro Martínez, Fernando García García, Javier Oliver Muncharaz</instructor><school>School:  Universitat Politècnica de Valencia</school><description>Este curso pretende dar una visión panorámica e introductoria de la inversión en bolsa.

People speak different languages and the countries they live in standardize on different currencies, date formats—even envelope sizes. Colors have different symbolism depending on cultural norms. And to accommodate all these differences, you want to do everything you possibly can to avoid the colossal effort of redesigning and rebuilding a different edition of your software for each and every market. This computer science course focuses on two aspects of “world-ready” design. The first is globalization: making the user experience and the code that implements it generic enough to accommodate most market differences. The second aspect is localization: customizing features for the local market. The more globalized your design, the easier it is to localize. The course instructors include designers and programmers who have worked on globalization and localization of some of the world’s most successful software. They’ve experienced the good, the bad, and the ugly of creating world-ready software, and they’re here to ensure your software’s user experience is one all your customers will enjoy, regardless of where they’re from or what language they speak. Previous programming or User Experience design experience is always helpful, but not necessary for this course. Completion of “Developing International Software” is also helpful, but not essential.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=51170</url></Course><Course><course_id>36395</course_id><title>Robot Mechanics and Control, Part I</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>4</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Frank C.

Ce questionnement d’ordre général peut trouver une première réponse dans l’étude historique de la confrontation entre christianisme et philosophie dans l’Antiquité. Cette confrontation a joué un rôle très important dans la constitution de la doctrine chrétienne. Elle prend la forme d’une polémique entre les chrétiens et les philosophes, mais également d’un rapprochement, les chrétiens reprenant à la philosophie un grand nombre de concepts et de modes de raisonnement pour penser, exprimer et défendre leur foi. On verra ce qui oppose le christianisme et la philosophie comme deux voies d’accès concurrentes à la vérité, avant d’envisager différents aspects de la dette du christianisme à l’égard de la philosophie antique. On se demandera pour finir quel a été le rôle du christianisme dans l’histoire de la philosophie en tant que telle. Ce cours constitue une introduction au christianisme des origines ainsi qu’au monde intellectuel de l’Empire romain.

It develops a toolkit of interdisciplinary analytical approaches and uses them to examine historical and contemporary global health initiatives with careful attention to a critical sociology of knowledge. Four physician-anthropologists - Paul Farmer, Arthur Kleinman, Anne Becker, and Salmaan Keshavjee - draw on experience working in Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Americas to investigate what the field of global health comprises, how global health problems are defined and constructed, and how global health interventions play out in both expected and unexpected ways. The course seeks to inspire and teach the following principles: A global awareness. This course aims to enable learners to recognize the role of distinctive traditions, governments, and histories in shaping health and well being. In addition, rather than framing a faceless mass of poor populations as the subject of global health initiatives, the course uses ethnographies and case studies to situate global health problems in relation to the lives of individuals, families, and communities. A foundation in social and historical analysis. The course demonstrates the value of social theory and historical analysis in understanding health and illness at individual and societal levels. An ethical engagement. Throughout the course, learners will be asked to critically evaluate the ethical frameworks that have underpinned historical and contemporary engagement in global health. Learners will be pushed to consider the moral questions of inequality and suffering as well as to critically evaluate various ethical frameworks that motivate and structure attempts to redress these inequities. A sense of inspiration and possibility. While the overwhelming challenges of global health could all too easily engender cynicism, passivity, and helplessness, learners will observe that no matter how complex the field of global health and no matter how steep the challenges, it is possible to design, implement, and foster programs and policies that make enormous positive change in the lives of the world’s poorest and suffering people.

Are you interested in robotics, and have heard of, or tried, “line-following" or “PID control” and want to understand more? Feedback control is a remarkably pervasive engineering principle. Feedback control uses sensor data (e.g. brightness, temperature, or velocity) to adjust or correct actuation (e.g. steering angle, motor acceleration, or heater output), and you use it all the time, like when you steer a bicycle, catch a ball, or stand upright.  But even though applications of feedback are very common, the subject is an uncommonly compelling example of mathematical theory guiding practical design.  In this engineering course we will introduce you to the theory and practice of feedback control and provide a glimpse into this rich and beautiful subject. Each week we will begin with a mathematical description of a fundamental feedback concept, combined with on-line exercises to test your understanding, and will finish with you designing, implementing, measuring, and exchanging video of your own propellor-levitated arm feedback system.  You will not need a background in calculus or software engineering to succeed in this class but you should be comfortable with algebra, mechanical forces, and modifying mathematical formulas in short computer programs. IMPORTANT: As this is a lab course, in order to participate, learners will need to collect a set of items to build the propeller arm. Learners will be responsible for purchasing items themselves and should have the items prior to the start of the course. We have created shopping lists via Amazon and Digikey listing all necessary items for simple purchase, but many of these items should be available through other vendors, or found locally. You will need ALL the parts on the following two lists (cost approximately $100 USD), and you should have the parts in hand BEFORE the first day of class! http://www.digikey.com/short/t2nb5t http://amzn.com/sl/1E146QPX99G3X Please wait a few minutes for the lists to populate. They are sometimes slow to update. Please note that this is a “Beta” class, you’ll be part of an experiment on incorporating physical labs in an on-line class.  Your experiences and contributions will shape the class, and impact a worldwide community.  </description><url>/enroll?course_id=51337</url></Course><Course><course_id>49806</course_id><title>Engineering: Building with Nature</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>4</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Marcel Stive, Jill Slinger, Building with Nature - Course Contributors</instructor><school>School:  Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)</school><description>If you’re interested in the concept of building with nature, then this is the engineering course for you.

Shakespeare is also rightly regarded as one of the greatest playwrights the world has known. This course will try to understand both Shakespeare’s popularity and his greatness by starting from a simple premise: that the fullest appreciation of Shakespeare can be achieved only when literary study is combined with analysis of the plays as theatre. Hence, as we delve into the dimensions that make Shakespeare’s plays so extraordinary--from the astonishing power of their language to their uncanny capacity to illuminate so much of human life--we will also explore them in performance from Shakespeare’s own theatre to the modern screen. At the same time, actors will occasionally join our effort and demonstrate ways of bringing the text alive as living theatre. Plays to be studied will include Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Much Ado About Nothing, Othello, King Lear, and The Winter's Tale.

Imagine the brilliance of its colour in the glass, the ripe fruit aromas on the nose, a hint of toasty oak and lingering tannins on the back palate. Perhaps you like a specific wine, but can’t pinpoint the reason why. The attributes that make wine so enjoyable are achieved through the expertise of viticulturists and winemakers, whose decision-making in the vineyard and winery is underpinned by science – to be precise, viticulture and oenology. The finer details can take years to learn, but in a matter of weeks this course will give you a broad understanding of the principles and practices used to grow grapes and make wine, and their impact on wine appearance, aroma, flavour and taste. You’ll also gain an appreciation for how cutting-edge research is helping to secure the future sustainability of the global wine industry. Whether you’re a wine novice or a seasoned oenophile,, this course is for anyone who loves wine and wine tasting. You’ll even get to make your own wine-- virtually at least! Confidently describe wine appearance, aroma, flavour and taste.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=41557</url></Course><Course><course_id>46961</course_id><title>The Book: The History of the Book in the 17th and 18th Century Europe</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>4</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Robert Darnton</instructor><school>School:  Harvard University</school><description>This module of The Book: Histories Across Time and Space focuses on the physical qualities of books, the role of books in 17th and 18th century France, and the emergence of literature as a modern form of culture. We will focus on the importance of books as physical objects and the raw material of literature--namely, paper.  By considering the nature of paper and how it was made during the early modern period--from Gutenberg's time to the early nineteenth century--we can begin to understand the character of books and the way they worked. This module also examines how books fit into the legal and political system of France under the Old Regime during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when the French set standards imitated throughout Europe.  Before modern copyright, legal books had privileges, granted by the king, which provided a guarantee of quality as well as certification of   orthodoxy.  To qualify for a privilege, books had to be approved by censors.  Uncensored books, including most of the works of the Enlightenment, were usually produced outside France and circulated in the kingdom through a vast underground distribution system.  In addition, this module addresses the emergence of literature as a modern form of culture, which can be studied best in eighteenth-century England.  The first copyright law (1710), a high rate of literacy, a booming consumer market, a precocious periodical industry, and entrepreneurial publishing concentrated in London led to the development of a new kind of author--the independent writer. Samuel Johnson epitomized this new phenomenon. This module will allow you to get a close look at him and everything he represented by providing access to the Hyde Collection of Johnson's books and papers in Houghton Library at Harvard.

In this course on Behavioral Medicine, you will learn about basic behavioral medicine concepts and explore how they can be applied to help people who need to change specific lifestyle behaviors to attain better health. Working with virtual patient interactions will give you a chance to test behavioral medicine interventions. You will also learn self¬-help tools based on behavioral medicine, for whatever you need to change in your own life. To help people who need to improve their health by changing their behaviors, we will learn about Motivational Interviewing (MI), a counseling style that stimulates behavior change. You will have an opportunity to test basic techniques in MI with a “virtual bartender” who has sleep problems that he is trying to solve by drinking alcohol. The following sections will focus on coping with stress, improving sleep, increasing physical activity and everyday behaviors like hand washing, safer sex and minimizing risky alcohol use. To complete this course, you will need to spend a total of about 30-40 hours. This time covers course videos, follow-up questions to help you remember what you have learned, course reading (mostly open access scientific articles) and homework tasks.

Esta creciente urbanización plantea desafíos importantes para los más de 15 mil municipios que existen en la región, exigiendo a los mismos hacer frente a las demandas de nuevos empleos, servicios urbanos, escuelas, transporte, viviendas y seguridad de forma consciente y planificada. Estas ciudades quieren avanzar hacia el desarrollo sostenible, buscando la manera de crecer económicamente, de forma inclusiva y respetando el medioambiente. ¿Pero cómo se avanza hacia el sueño de la sostenibilidad? ¿Cómo conseguimos crear actividad económica sin contaminar el aire y los ríos? ¿Cómo podemos crear riqueza y que los recursos lleguen a todas las personas? ¿Cómo hacer ciudades más seguras y participativas?   Para reflexionar sobre estas y otras preguntas, el BID ha creado un curso que busca fortalecer en los participantes las capacidades para gestionar el desarrollo sostenible de las ciudades, a través del dominio conceptual, procedimental y actitudinal de las principales áreas de competencia de la ciudad y de la herramienta de la Iniciativa Ciudades Emergentes y Sostenibles del BID, permitiéndoles desarrollar habilidades y construir estrategias innovadoras y multisectoriales para dar respuesta a los desafíos de la sostenibilidad.   Para conocer más detalles del curso haz clic aquí. La preparación de este curso  fue financiada por el Fondo de Fortalecimiento de la Capacidad Institucional (ICSF), gracias al aporte del Gobierno de la República Popular de China.   *This course is taught in Spanish. Today, more than 80 percent of the population of Latin America and the Caribbean lives in urban areas, and this figure will reach almost 90 percent by 2050. This growing urbanization poses significant challenges for the more than 15,000 municipalities in the region, requiring that they address demand for new jobs, urban services, schools, transportation, housing and security in a conscious and planned way. These cities want to progress toward sustainable development and find ways to ensure that economic growth is inclusive and environmentally friendly. But how can progress be made toward the goal of sustainability? How can we promote economic activities without polluting our air and rivers? How can we create wealth and ensure that resources are accessible to everyone? How can we make our cities safer and more participative? To reflect on these and other questions, the IDB has developed a course aimed at strengthening participants' ability to manage the sustainable development of cities, through mastery of the concepts, procedures and attitudes of the principal areas of city competitiveness and the tool developed for IDB's Emerging and Sustainable Cities Initiative (ESCI). Through this course, participants will develop skills and create innovative, multi-sector strategies to address the challenges of sustainability.   To learn more details about the course click here.  The preparation of this course was financed by the Institutional Capacity Strengthening Fund (ICSF), thanks to the contribution of the Government of the People's Republic of China.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=27544</url></Course><Course><course_id>34601</course_id><title>Our Energetic Earth</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>4</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Bryan W. Karney, Jingya Xing, Samiha Tahseen</instructor><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><description>We live on the surface of a dynamic and yet paradoxically stable planet that experiences a remarkable range of energetic phenomena, from waves and currents in the ocean to wind and thunderstorms in the atmosphere. This course traces how the remarkable concept called energy is the natural way of describing, understanding and unifying these diverse phenomena. The course traces the cascade of energy from sunlight to its final destination in a thermal form, considering differential surface heating, the role of convection and buoyancy and the formation of the Earth’s circulation system, and the links to the ocean circulation system. We consider the curvature and rotation of the Earth as key constraints on a system driven by sunlight and energy transformations. Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs. Learn more. How much time will the course take? Obviously the answer will depend on your background and motivation to master the course material. Each week will consist of 5 or 6 segments that will each take 5 to 10 minutes to watch or listen to once. There will be some exploratory questions for each lesson and a confirmation quiz for each week. There will be one exploratory activity for each week. The average commitment will be 2-3 hours per week with perhaps 20 hours required for the whole course. What background does the course assume? We’ll ask you to pull out a calculator from time to time (but not all the time!) simply as this will help you really master the key ideas. The key thing is to have a curiosity and interest in what makes our planet tick! What kind of learning activities will the course involve? The activities are designed to use basic household objects, and our own senses, to engage with observations of the world, and to think about what these mean and lead to. We’ll get you to sense how cold or warm different objects get when left in the sun, and to observe how energy explains things we see and hear. What difference will the course make to my life? The course has the conviction that it is hard to care for or value things that we don’t appreciate or have never considered. Although harsh in certain places and times, the Earth’s surface is remarkably habitable. Many forms of life can make their way in many kinds of terrain and climate. What produces these conditions? How are they maintained? We will seek to answer those questions in rudimentary form at least. What conversations will the course help to perform? Courses often imagine a context in which the course material is discussed, and this one is no different. It imagines a setting with family or friends where you might have just learned of a news event involving a storm like a hurricane or thunderstorm, or where a community might have experienced a flood or a drought, or merely unusual weather. You might have heard of El Nino or climate change in the news. This course will give you a background to better engage in a conversation about these great matters, and offer a better sense of the complexity, challenge and wonder connected to living on the surface of such an energetic planet.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=34601</url></Course><Course><course_id>14090</course_id><title>Introduction to Philosophy: God, Knowledge and Consciousness</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>4</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Caspar Hare, Ryan Doody</instructor><school>School:  MIT</school><description>This course has two goals. The first is to introduce you to the things that philosophers think about. We will look at some perennial philosophical problems: Is there a God? What is knowledge, and how do we get it? What is the place of our consciousness in the physical world? Do we have free will? How do we persist over time, as our bodily and psychological traits change? The second goal is to get you thinking philosophically yourself. This will help you develop your critical reasoning and argumentative skills more generally. Along the way we will draw from late, great classical authors and influential contemporary figures. If you wish to take the course as a 'verified' student (technological checks guarantee it is you taking the course) then please register as Verified below. It will cost you $50. Upon completing the course you will receive a certificate that says that you completed the course as a 'verified' student. Otherwise you can take the course as a non-verified student (you guarantee it is you taking the course by signing an honor code) for free.

The pleasure of actually saying a poem, or even saying it in your imagination—your mind’s ear—is essential. That is a central idea of “The Art of Poetry,” well demonstrated by the videos at favoritepoem.org: the photographer saying Sylvia Plath’s “Nick and the Candlestick,” the high school student saying Langston Hughes’ “Minstrel Man.” Those readers base what they say about each poem upon their experience of saying it. The course is demanding, and based on a certain kind of intense reading, requiring prolonged, thorough— in fact, repeated—attention to specific poems. The focus will be on elements of the art such as poetry’s historical relation to courtship; techniques of sound in free verse; poetry and difficulty; kidding and tribute—with only incidental attention to “schools,” jargons, categories, and coteries. Learners are encouraged to think truly, carefully and passionately about what the poem says, along with how the poem feels in one’s own, actual or imagined voice. As Robert Pinsky says, in the Preface to Singing School: “this anthology will succeed if it encourages the reader to emulate it by replacing it . . . create your own anthology.” In a comparable way, this course hopes to inspire a lifelong study of poetry.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=16426</url></Course><Course><course_id>48085</course_id><title>Atomic and Optical Physics I– Part 3: Atom-Light Interactions 1 -- Matrix elements and quantized field</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>1</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  David E. Pritchard, Isaac Chuang, Wolfgang Ketterle</instructor><school>School:  MIT</school><description>This is the third of five modules to introduce concepts and current frontiers of atomic physics and to prepare you for cutting-edge research: 8.421.1x: Resonance 8.421.2x: Atomic structure and atoms in external field 8.421.3x: Atom-Light Interactions 1 -- Matrix elements and quantized field 8.421.4x: Atom-Light interactions 2 --  Line broadening and two-photon transitions 8.421.5x: Coherence The third module, 8.421.3x, covers how atoms interact with light. First, dipole and higher order couplings are introduced, and concrete examples for selection rules and matrix elements are given. After quantizing the electromagnetic field and introducing photons, the Jaynes-Cummings model and vacuum Rabi oscillations are presented. Coherent and incoherent time evolution are discussed, also in the framework of Einstein's A and B coefficients. At MIT, the content of the five modules makes the first of a two-semester sequence (8.421 and 8.422) for graduate students interested in Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics. This sequence is required for Ph.D. students doing research in this field. In these modules you will learn about the interaction of radiation with atoms: resonance; absorption, stimulated and spontaneous emission; methods of resonance, dressed atom formalism, masers and lasers, cavity quantum electrodynamics; structure of simple atoms, behavior in very strong fields; fundamental tests: time reversal, parity violations, Bell's inequalities; and experimental methods. Completing the two-course sequence allows you to pursue advanced study and research in cold atoms, as well as specialized topics in condensed matter physics.   FAQ Who can register for this course? Unfortunately, learners from Iran, Cuba, Sudan and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time. While edX has received a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to offer courses to learners from Iran and Sudan our license does not cover this course. Separately, EdX has applied for a license to offer courses to learners in the Crimea region of Ukraine, but we are awaiting a determination from OFAC on that application. We are deeply sorry the U.S. government has determined that we have to block these learners, and we are working diligently to rectify this situation as soon as possible.

How does surveillance affect how we use cellular and other technologies? How does it affect our democratic institutions? Do you know that the metadata collected by a cellular network speaks volumes about its users? In this course you will explore all of these questions while investigating related issues in WiFi and Internet surveillance. The issues explored in this course are at the intersection of networking technology, law, and sociology and will appeal to anyone interested in the technical, political, and moral questions inherent in the use of information networks. The course will include broad overviews for the novice, while pointing to the detailed resources needed for those engaged in the development of corporate or governmental policies. FAQ Is there a required textbook? ​No. A list of supplemental resources, including textbooks, will be provided. The textbook, Cellular Convergence and the Death of Privacy, is optional. How much time will I spend on the course during the week? Expect to spend 4-8 hours per week. This depends on a number of factors, including how much you want to engage with the material and the level of understanding you desire. Do I need to have taken an electrical and computer engineering course before? No. Though there will be discussion of electrical and computer engineering (ECE) ideas, the professor will assume no prior ECE training. I am not familiar with U.S. or European history but I am interested in how the law regarding cell phones works. Can I take this course? Yes. I will have relevant links to helpful background material for each section that should make it possible for those with no knowledge of U.S. or European history to take the class. Is this class about building a network? This class is primarily about how historical privacy law has made it possible for current information technologies to be used to collect data and conduct surveillance rather than how to build a network. While the course will touch on important engineering developments and information technology uses, this class will focus more on the intersection of networking technology, law, and sociology. If you want to know how cell phones collect data and why this data can be used in court, this is the class for you. Will certificates be awarded? Yes.

Today’s nanotransistors are a high volume, high impact success of the nanotechnology revolution. If you are interested in understanding how this scientifically interesting and technologically important nano-device operates, this course is for you! This nanotechnology course provides a simple, conceptual framework for understanding the essential physics of nanoscale transistors.  It assumes only a basic background in semiconductor physics and provides an opportunity to learn how some of the fascinating new discoveries about the flow of electrons at the nanoscale plays out in the context of a practical device. The course is divided into four units: Transistors fundamentals Transistor electrostatics Ballistic MOSFETs Transmission theory of the MOSFET The first two units provide an introduction for students with no background in transistors or a quick review for those familiar with transistors.  The third unit treats the ballistic transistor in which electrons move without resistance (in the traditional sense). The last unit uses that Landauer Approach to electron transport, which was developed to understand some striking experiments in nanophysics, to develop an understanding of how electrons flow in modern nanotransistors.  This short course describes a way of understanding MOSFETs that is much more suitable than traditional approaches when the channel lengths are of nanoscale dimensions. Surprisingly, the final result looks much like the traditional, textbook, MOSFET model, but the parameters in the equations have simple, clear interpretations at the nanoscale. My objective for this course is to provide students with an understanding of the essential physics of nanoscale transistors as well as some of the practical technological considerations and fundamental limits. The goal is to do this in a way that is broadly accessible to students with only a very basic knowledge of semiconductor physics and electronic circuits. The course is designed for anyone seeking a sound, physical, but simple understanding of how nanoscale transistors operate. The course should be useful for advanced undergraduates, beginning graduate students, as well as researchers and practicing engineers and scientists. This course is the latest in a series offered by the nanoHUB-U project which is jointly funded by Purdue and NSF with the goal of transcending disciplines through short courses accessible to students in any branch of science or engineering. These courses focus on cutting-edge topics distilled into short lectures with quizzes and practice exams.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=48094</url></Course><Course><course_id>48086</course_id><title>The Extremes of Life: Microbes and Their Diversity</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>1</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Haruyuki Atomi</instructor><school>School:  Kyoto University</school><description>Life on our planet is diverse. While we can easily recognize this in our everyday surroundings, an even more diverse world of life can be seen when we look under a microscope. This is the world of microorganisms. Microorganisms are everywhere, and although some are notorious for their roles in human disease, many play important roles in sustaining our global environment. We will explore these and in particular, those that thrive in the most extreme environments on our planet, the extremophiles. In this course, we will discover how diverse life is on our planet and consider the basic principles that govern evolution. We will also learn how to classify organisms. One method is based on the different mechanisms that organisms utilize to conserve energy and obtain carbon. Another method is based on comparing sequences of common molecules present in different organisms. In the latter half of the course we will introduce the various extremophiles that have been not identified until now, and their basic characteristics. Finally, focusing on the thermophiles, we will study how proteins from thermophiles can maintain their structure and function at high temperatures.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=48086</url></Course><Course><course_id>14132</course_id><title>Introduction to Statistics: Inference</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>1</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Ani Adhikari, Philip B. Stark</instructor><school>School:  Berkeley</school><description>Statistics 2 at Berkeley is an introductory class taken by about 1,000 students each year. Stat2.3x is the last in a sequence of three courses that make up Stat2x, the online equivalent of Berkeley's Stat 2. The focus of Stat2.3x is on statistical inference: how to make valid conclusions based on data from random samples. At the heart of the main problem addressed by the course will be a population (which you can imagine for now as a set of people) connected with which there is a numerical quantity of interest (which you can imagine for now as the average number of MOOCs the people have taken). If you could talk to each member of the population, you could calculate that number exactly. But what if the population is so large that your resources will not stretch to interviewing every member? What if you can only reach a subset of the population? Stat 2.3x will discuss good ways to select the subset (yes, at random); how to estimate the numerical quantity of interest, based on what you see in your sample; and ways to test hypotheses about numerical or probabilistic aspects of the problem. The methods that will be covered are among the most commonly used of all statistical techniques. If you have ever read an article that claimed, "The margin of error in such surveys is about three percentage points," or, "Researchers at the University of California at Berkeley have discovered a highly significant link between ...," then you should expect that by the end of Stat 2.3x you will have a pretty good idea of what that means. Examples will range all the way from a little girl's school science project (seriously – she did a great job and her results were published in a major journal) to rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court. The fundamental approach of the series was provided in the description of Stat2.1x and appears here again: There will be no mindless memorization of formulas and methods. Throughout the course, the emphasis will be on understanding the reasoning behind the calculations, the assumptions under which they are valid, and the correct interpretation of results.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=14132</url></Course><Course><course_id>69542</course_id><title>Pensiones en América Latina y el Caribe</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>1</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Carmen Pagés-Serra, Ángel Melguizo, Mariano Bosch, Solange Berstein</instructor><school>School:  Inter-American Development Bank</school><description>***Este curso será impartido en español*** En las próximas décadas, las pensiones se convertirán en uno de los ejes centrales de las políticas económicas y sociales en América Latina y el Caribe (ALC). ¿La razón? En 2050 habrá en la región el triple de adultos mayores que ahora, con una mayor esperanza de vida y, por lo tanto mayores necesidades de atención. Esos adultos mayores del futuro están hoy en un mercado de trabajo donde sólo 4 de cada 10 trabajadores contribuyen a un sistema de pensiones. Esto significa que en la actualidad 130 millones de personas están trabajando sin ahorrar para su pensión en ALC. En ausencia de reformas, incluso con un crecimiento sostenido en la región, 1 de cada 2 jubilados no tendrá una pensión o esta no será adecuada, dejando entre 66 y 83 millones de adultos mayores dependiendo de las familias o del Estado para su manutención, lo que será económica, fiscal y socialmente insostenible. Por otra parte, aquellos sistemas que prometen beneficios más generosos tienen baja cobertura y eventuales problemas de equidad y sustentabilidad. Lo que genera un importante desafío, ya que el aumentar la cobertura bajo el mismo diseño puede mejorar la situación financiera en el corto plazo, pero acrecentar los problemas de sustentabilidad en el largo plazo. En este curso comprenderemos las complejidades que afronta el mercado de trabajo en ALC y, por ende, su sistema de pensiones. Vamos a esclarecer las políticas que se pueden formular en los diferentes contextos de la Región que podrían llevar a un funcionamiento de sistemas de pensiones más eficientes, financieramente sostenibles y equitativos y así ofrecer “mejores pensiones” a todos los adultos mayores, no solo a unos pocos.

Or how and why curators, historians, archivists, and preservationists do what they do? In Tangible Things, you will discover how material objects have shaped academic disciplines and reinforced or challenged boundaries between people. This course will draw on some of the most fascinating items housed at Harvard University, highlighting several to give you a sense of the power of learning through tangible things. By “stepping onto” the storied campus, you and your fellow learners can explore Harvard’s astonishing array of tangible things—books and manuscripts, art works, scientific specimens, ethnographic artifacts, and historical relics of all sorts. The University not only owns a Gutenberg bible, but it also houses in its collections Turkish sun dials, a Chinese crystal ball, a divination basket from Angola, and nineteenth-century “spirit writing” chalked on a child-sized slate. Tucked away in storage cabinets or hidden in closets and the backrooms of its museums and libraries are Henry David Thoreau’s pencil, a life mask of Abraham Lincoln, and chemicals captured from a Confederate ship. The Art Museums not only care for masterpieces of Renaissance painting but also for a silver-encrusted cup made from a coconut. The Natural History Museum not only preserves dinosaur bones and a fish robot but an intact Mexican tortilla more than a century old. In the first section of the course, we will consider how a statue, a fish, and a gingham gown have contributed to Harvard’s history, and you will learn the value of stopping to look at the things around you. In the next section, we will explore some of the ways people have brought things together into purposeful collections to preserve memory, promote commerce, and define culture. Finally, we will consider methods of rearranging objects to create new ways of thinking about nature, time, and ordinary work. Along the way, you will discover new ways of looking at, organizing, and interpreting tangible things in your own environment.

Caso esta tendência se mantenha, a taxa de urbanização em 2030 será de cerca de 90%, fazendo da região a mais urbanizada do planeta. Essa tendência consolida a cidade como o centro do desenvolvimento econômico e humano da região. A cidade está criando trabalho, está inovando, está repensando seus sistemas de saúde e educação, transporte, está fazendo frente às mudanças do clima, está abrindo espaços para o debate e a socialização. Para que esse dinamismo possa traduzir-se em um fenômeno exitoso, a cidade deve aprender a planejar seu presente pensando em seu futuro, buscando o equilíbrio entre crescimento econômico, a inclusão social e o respeito ao meio ambiente. É, portanto, responsabilidade das cidades melhorar a qualidade de vida das gerações presentes sem comprometer o bem estar das gerações futuras. Com o objetivo de responder a este desafio, o BID criou um curso que busca fortalecer os conhecimentos e capacidades dos participantes em gerir o desenvolvimento sustentável de suas cidades. E para isso, o curso parte da premissa que a sustentabilidade das cidades só será alcançada por meio de uma perspectiva integrada e intersetorial; uma perspectiva integral, onde se trabalhe de maneira conjunta os desafios econômicos, fiscais, urbanos, ambientais, institucionais e de governabilidade das cidades junto com uma perspectiva intersetorial, onde as diferentes áreas e níveis de governo se coordenem e que se articulem com o setor privado e com a sociedade civil. Com o objetivo de entender melhor essa perspectiva, o curso analisa a situação, os desafios setoriais e intersetoriais que as cidades encontram na gestão das principais áreas de sua competência: finanças subnacionais, desenvolvimento produtivo, planejamento urbano, transporte, segurança cidadã, água, ar etc. Desta forma, com o objetivo de abordar o planejamento do desenvolvimento sustentável das cidades médias latino americanas, o curso apresenta a “Iniciativa Cidades Emergentes e Sustentáveis”, uma ferramenta de gestão que permite dar sentido ao trabalho analítico das dimensões/desafios de forma integrada. Assim como na América Latina e no Caribe, o Brasil possui grandes desafios ambientais, urbanos e fiscais para a sustentabilidade de suas cidades. Dentre eles se destacam os altos índices de violência - 25,8 mortes violentas por 100 mil habitantes segundo o Fórum Brasileiro de Segurança Pública; a desigualdade urbana, uma vez que o país é o 4º mais desigual da América Latina e Caribe; e a vulnerabilidade diante de desastres naturais, onde se calcula, por exemplo, que a reconstrução das cidades cariocas devastadas pelas enchentes e pelos deslizamentos de 2011 custou 1,3% do PIB do estado do Rio de Janeiro; ou ainda, degradação ambiental, com um índice de 63% de esgoto sendo lançado nos corpos hídricos sem nenhum tratamento, segundo o MCidades. Além de fornecer conceitos e uma visão abrangente da situação do Brasil em relação à sustentabilidade das cidades, neste curso serão abordados alguns desafios dos municípios, bem como exemplos práticos de como esses problemas estão sendo enfrentados.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=49435</url></Course><Course><course_id>49805</course_id><title>Lessons from Ebola: Preventing the Next Pandemic</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>5</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Ashish Jha</instructor><school>School:  Harvard University</school><description>Like no other event in recent history, the 2014 Ebola outbreak has made clear the fragility of existing health systems.

Together, they are designed to help people with no prior exposure to computer science or programming learn to think computationally and write programs to tackle useful problems. Some of the people taking the two courses will use them as a stepping stone to more advanced computer science courses, but for many it will be their first and last computer science courses. Since these courses may be the only formal computer science courses many of the students take, we have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics so they will have an idea of what is possible when they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. That said, they are not "computation appreciation" courses. They are challenging and rigorous courses in which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend the computer to their will. ** This course will transition from using Python 2.7 to using Python 3.5. ** The summer 2016 run will be the last one to use Python 2.7. Starting from autumn 2016, all material in this course will be taught using Python 3.5. We will update the lecture videos, lecture exercises, and problem sets to use the new version of Python. Even if you take the course with Python 2.7, you will be able to easily transition to Python 3.5 in future courses. The lecture topics and difficulty of this course and the one following it (6.00.2x) will mostly remain the same. FAQ What type of computing environment do I need for this course? You need to have a computer running one of the following operating systems: Microsoft Windows, version XP or greater (XP, Windows Vista, or Windows 7) Apple OSX, version 10.2 or greater Linux - most distributions that have been released within the past two years should work In addition, you will need the ability to download, install, and run software on your computer. What browser should I use? We strongly recommend that you use the Chrome browser while visiting the edX site. This site is optimized for viewing in Chrome. If you cannot use Chrome, you should use the Firefox browser. Be advised you may have trouble with site functionality if you choose to use an alternate browser. What programming language(s) will this course use? 6.00x will be using the Python programming language, version 2.7. You are not expected to have any prior programming knowledge - this course is intended for students who have little to no experience with any programming language. What is the format of the class? The class will consist of lecture videos, which are broken into small chunks, usually between eight and twelve minutes each. Some of these may contain integrated "check-yourself" questions. There will also be programming assignments and standalone exams/quizzes, which are not part of the video lectures. Will the text of the lectures be available? Yes, transcripts of the course will be made available. Do I need to watch the lectures live? No. You can watch the lectures at your leisure - you do not need to watch the lectures at any set time. How much does it cost to take the course? Nothing: the course is free.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=14094</url></Course><Course><course_id>69195</course_id><title>Introduction to Computer Science</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>124</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  David J.

Potential applications range from aerial filming over remote visual inspection of industrial sites to automatic 3D reconstruction of buildings. Navigating a quadrotor manually requires a skilled pilot and constant concentration. Therefore, there is a strong scientific interest to develop solutions that enable quadrotors to fly autonomously and without constant human supervision. This is a challenging research problem because the payload of a quadrotor is uttermost constrained and so both the quality of the onboard sensors and the available computing power is strongly limited.  In this course, we will introduce the basic concepts for autonomous navigation for quadrotors. The following topics will be covered: 3D geometry, probabilistic state estimation, visual odometry, SLAM, 3D mapping, linear control. In particular, you will learn how to infer the position of the quadrotor from its sensor readings and how to navigate it along a trajectory. The course consists of a series of weekly lecture videos that we be interleaved by interactive quizzes and hands-on programming tasks. For the flight experiments, we provide a browser-based quadrotor simulator which requires the students to write small code snippets in Python. This course is intended for undergraduate and graduate students in computer science, electrical engineering or mechanical engineering. This course has been offered by TUM for the first time in summer term 2014 on EdX with more than 20.000 registered students of which 1400 passed examination. The MOOC is based on the previous TUM lecture “Visual Navigation for Flying Robots” which received the TUM TeachInf best lecture award in 2012 and 2013. FAQ Do I need to buy a textbook? No, all required materials will be provided within the courseware. However, if you are interested, we recommend the following additional materials: This course is based on the TUM lecture Visual Navigation for Flying Robots.

We will emphasize approaches proven to be effective and show you how to implement them. We will also give you the opportunity to reflect on your own teaching experience and exchange ideas and share challenges with other learners in the course. We will begin by looking at the most common method of teaching science, the lecture. We’ll discuss what the lecture method does well and look at data that illustrates when it is less effective. You will hear highly successful teachers talk about their experience with lecture and how they modified their lecture time to more actively engage students. We’ll investigate creating learning objectives and how they can be used to communicate your expectations to students. You will practice writing your own learning objectives and see how they can streamline exam construction. We’ll look at a variety of ways to include active learning during class time, discuss how active learning strategies support your learning objectives, and give you practice developing learning activities for biology topics you find challenging to teach.  Lastly, we’ll look at how to use resources for student learning outside of class, and how to know that your students have successfully learned from both in-class and outside of class activities. Our course is designed for instructors, or instructors-to-be, of undergraduate-level biology. High school instructors of AP Biology, post-doctoral fellows and graduate students looking ahead to teaching should find the course useful. The course can serve as a means of professional development. There are no pre-requisites, although prior satisfactory completion of a college biology course is highly recommended.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=51171</url></Course><Course><course_id>48078</course_id><title>新药发现和药物靶点 Drug Discovery and its Target</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>1</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  蒲 小平, 赵 欣, 孙 懿</instructor><school>School:  Peking University</school><description>不论企业或其他新药研发人员，还是药师，我们共同的目的之一就是基于药物靶点发现新药。要做到这一点，首先我们必须了解新药发现的步骤，以及临床常用的主要代表药物的治疗作用及其相应靶点，《新药发现和药物靶点》所要介绍的就是作为一个新药研发人员或药师如何发现新药，进而明确需要解决的若干问题。 新药发现中基于药物靶点的药效学评价已经成为当今国内外新药研究和开发的基本方针。现代新药研发的主要内容之一就是寻找和确定药物靶点。当药物靶点确定之后，就要开展基于靶点的药效学评价，从而发现新药。通过本MOOC学习，使学生了解常见药物靶点的常见类型，掌握新药发现的基本步骤及其途径，又能学习抗血栓药物、抗糖尿病药物、抗恶性肿瘤药物、免疫抑制药、抗帕金森病药物、、抗阿尔茨海默病药物、心血管药物、抗菌药物 8大类代表药物的治疗作用及其相应的靶点。本课程还将关注全球新药研发动态。 同时本MOOC课程强调通俗性，需要先修课程是【生物学】，有【生物学】基础的学生就能学习本MOOC课程。平时每周有测试，期末有考试。考试合格颁发证书。</description><url>/enroll?course_id=48078</url></Course><Course><course_id>65179</course_id><title>Data Structures and Algorithm Design Part I 数据结构与算法设计(上)</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>1</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Junhui Deng</instructor><school>School:  Tsinghua University</school><description>Data structures play a central role in computer science and are the cornerstones of efficient algorithms.

Immunology has a long history, and researchers around the world faced with the “enemies of human life” have solved numerous immunological mysteries, and contributed to a paradigm shift in immunology. Nonetheless, it is as yet unknown how certain diseases like AIDS, influenza and allergies can be completely conquered. The latest immunological research is revealing that immunity is also strongly correlated with an increasing number of other diseases such as cancer, arteriosclerosis and diabetes. If we could fully understand the mechanism of immunity, we should be able to treat such diseases. We would like to introduce basic knowledge of immunology revealed by past research and share our insights on the latest findings with you for the future development of immunology.   During this course you will learn the mechanisms of the immune system and deepen your understanding of forefront immunology research and development of medical applications.  We especially encourage young people who are interested in life-science and immunology to join this course, as it will assist consideration of immunology research as a career.   The part one of the course consists of 5 lectures of about 90 minutes each.

We start by learning the mathematical definition of distance and use this to motivate the use of the singular value decomposition (SVD) for dimension reduction and multi-dimensional scaling and its connection to principle component analysis. We will learn about the batch effect: the most challenging data analytical problem in genomics today and describe how the techniques can be used to detect and adjust for batch effects. Specifically, we will describe the principal component analysis and factor analysis and demonstrate how these concepts are applied to data visualization and data analysis of high-throughput experimental data. Finally, we give a brief introduction to machine learning and apply it to high-throughput data. We describe the general idea behind clustering analysis and descript K-means and hierarchical clustering and demonstrate how these are used in genomics and describe prediction algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors along with the concepts of training sets, test sets, error rates and cross-validation. Given the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you. If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology lectures. Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty relatively quickly across the first three courses. By the third course will be teaching advanced statistical concepts such as hierarchical models and by the fourth advanced software engineering skills, such as parallel computing and reproducible research concepts. The courses in this series will be released sequentially each month and are self-paced: PH525.1x: Statistics and R for the Life Sciences PH525.2x: Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra PH525.3x: Statistical Inference and Modeling for High-throughput Experiments PH525.4x: High-Dimensional Data Analysis PH525.5x: Introduction to Bioconductor: annotation and analysis of genomes and genomic assays  PH525.6x: High-performance computing for reproducible genomics PH525.7x: Case studies in functional genomics This class was supported in part by NIH grant R25GM114818.

That crazy data collection from your boss? Megabytes of sensor data to analyze? Looking for a smart way visualize your data in order to make sense out of it? We’ve got you covered! Using video lectures and hands-on exercises, we will teach you cutting-edge techniques and best practices that will boost your data analysis and visualization skills. We will take a deep dive into data analysis with spreadsheets: PivotTables, VLOOKUPS, Named ranges, what-if analyses, making great graphs - all those will be covered in the first weeks of the course. After that, we will investigate the quality of the spreadsheet model, and especially how to make sure your spreadsheet remains error-free and robust. Finally, once we have mastered spreadsheets, we will demonstrate other ways to store and analyze data. We will also look into how Python, a programming language, can help us with analyzing and manipulating data in spreadsheets. EX101x is created using Excel 2013 and Windows. Most assignments can be made using another spreadsheet program and operating system as well, but we cannot offer full support for all configurations. The goal of this course is to help you to overcome data analysis challenges in your work, research or studies. Therefore we encourage you to participate actively and to raise real data analysis problems that you face in our discussion forums.  This course is part of the Data Analysis XSeries.

With this in mind, it is no surprise that one fourth of the CEOs of the world’s 100 largest corporations have an engineering degree. Solving these global problems requires leaders who, in the first place, are comfortable with technology, models and quantitative analyses -- Leaders who see systems instead of isolated problems. However, simply understanding technology is not enough. Successful leaders today must have both the ideas and the know-how to put these ideas into action by working collaboratively with others, winning their hearts and minds. We need leaders who know how to seize opportunities in a networked world, and can mobilize people and other stakeholders for large-scale change. Leaders who lead fulfilling lives and who are able to move themselves and others from the ‘me’ to the ‘we’. Leaders who are long-term oriented and who deliver economic profit, while also making positive contributions to society and the environment. We call these leaders ‘sustainable leaders’. This course has three parts:  In the first part, you will explore the context that leaders are facing, building an understanding of the complexities of global and business challenges. You will discover the ambiguities and the many stakeholders that leaders must consider when making their choices. You will get a sense of effective leadership practices. In the second part, you will discover your “who am I” through personal and group exercises. You will create a “Personal Charter” that can serve as a life-long guide, helping you, as a leader, to make important choices in your personal and professional life. In the third part, we will bring the knowledge of the context and yourself together. We will translate the insights of this course into a leadership model and you will discover what sustainable leaders do. We will offer you frameworks to help you make your own career choices. We will finally help you to ‘sell’ yourself as a leader.

Among other features, functional languages offer a compact notation for writing programs, powerful abstraction methods for structuring programs, and a simple mathematical basis that supports reasoning about programs. Functional languages represent the leading edge of programming language design, and the primary setting in which new programming concepts are introduced and studied. All contemporary programming languages such as Hack/PHP, C#, Visual Basic, F#, C++, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java, Scala, Clojure, Groovy, Racket, … support higher-order programming via the concept of closures or lambda expressions. This course will use Haskell as the medium for understanding the basic principles of functional programming. While the specific language isn't all that important, Haskell is a pure functional language so it is entirely appropriate for learning the essential ingredients of programming using mathematical functions. It is also a relatively small language, and hence it should be easy for you to get up to speed with Haskell. Once you understand the Why, What and How that underlies pure functional programming and learned to “think like a fundamentalist”, we will apply the concepts of functional programming to “code like a hacker” in mainstream programming languages, using Facebook’s novel Hack language as our main example. This course assumes no prior knowledge of functional programming, but assumes you have at least one year of programming experience in a regular programming language such as Java, .NET, Javascript or PHP.

Alrededor del 80% de estos teléfonos llevaban en su interior el sistema operativo Android. No cabe duda, por lo tanto, de que formarse en Android es una de las mejores inversiones que puede hacer un programador en la actualidad. Como cabría esperar, escribir aplicaciones para dispositivos móviles no es lo mismo que hacerlo para ordenadores de sobremesa. Las aplicaciones móviles deben ser capaces de ejecutarse en un rango enorme de dispositivos, no solo teléfonos, sino también relojes, pulseras, coches y televisores. Android da una respuesta satisfactoria a estos desafíos en código abierto y recientemente ha añadido plataformas como Android Wear, Android TV y Android Auto, que abren una nueva frontera de desarrollo. El objetivo de este curso es que los estudiantes aprendan los fundamentos de la programación en Android mediante el desarrollo paso a paso de una aplicación. Al finalizar el curso cada estudiante habrá completado un pequeño juego casi sin darse cuenta, adquiriendo los conocimientos necesarios para utilizar los principales elementos de Android como son las actividades, los ficheros de diseño, las intenciones, los fragmentos, los menús, los diálogos, las preferencias, etc. Esperamos que disfrutes del curso.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=69896</url></Course><Course><course_id>45518</course_id><title>Learn to Program Using Python</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>12</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Farhad Kamangar</instructor><school>School:  University of Texas at Arlington</school><description>Interested in learning a computer programming language but unsure of how and where to begin?

This course is Part 2 of a 4-part series on Business Statistics, and is ideal for learners who wish to enroll in business programs. The first two parts cover topics in Descriptive Statistics, whereas the next two focus on Inferential Statistics. Spreadsheets containing real data from diverse areas such as economics, finance and HR drive much of our discussions.   In Part 2, we use the language of probability to examine the underlying distributions of random variables. We model real-life phenomena using known variables such as Binomial, Poisson and Normal. We learn how to simulate data that are distributed according to these variables. We shall take up datasets that have over a million rows, which makes it difficult to analyze using a spreadsheet. This is a natural setting for R, an advanced statistical programming platform. We incorporate helpful tutorials to get learners acquainted with the platform. </description><url>/enroll?course_id=69892</url></Course><Course><course_id>47767</course_id><title>Implementing Real-Time Analysis with Hadoop in Azure HDInsight</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>4</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Graeme Malcolm</instructor><school>School:  Microsoft</school><description>In this four week course, you’ll learn how to implement low-latency and streaming Big Data solutions using Hadoop technologies like HBase, Storm, and Spark on Microsoft Azure HDInsight.

Lue</instructor><school>School:  Harvard University</school><description>The cell is a powerful case study to help us explore the functional logic of living systems. All organisms, from single-celled algae to complex multicellular organisms like us, are made up of cells. In this course, you will learn the how and why of biology by exploring the function of the molecular components of cells, and how these cellular components are organized in a complex hierarchy. This course is designed to explore the fundamentals of cell biology. The overarching goal is for learners to understand, from a human-centered perspective, that cells are evolving ensembles of macromolecules that in turn form complex communities in tissues, organs, and multicellular organisms. We will focus, in particular, on the mitochondrion, the organelle that powers the cell. In this context, we will look at the processes of cell metabolism. Finally, we will examine the F1F0 ATP synthase, the molecular machine that is responsible for the synthesis of most of the ATP that your cells require to do work. To underscore the importance of cell biology to our lives, we will address questions of development and disease and implications of science in society. By the end of four weeks, we hope learners will have a deep intuition for the functional logic of a cell. Together we will ask how do things work within a cell, why do they work the way they do, and how are we impacted? Join us as we explore the extraordinary and wonderfully dynamic world of the cell.

The practical applications of this principle are quite profound, and already within the last eight years they have lead to prediction and discovery of a vast range of new materials with exotic properties that were considered to be impossible before. What will you gain from this course? Learn about the variety of subtopics in topological materials, their relation to each other and to the general principles. Learn to follow active research on topology, and critically understand it on your own. Acquire skills required to engage in research on your own, and to minimize confusion that often arises even among experienced researchers. What is the focus of this course? Applications of topology in condensed matter based on bulk-edge correspondence. Special attention to the most active research topics in topological condensed matter: theory of topological insulators and Majorana fermions, topological classification of "grand ten” symmetry classes, and topological quantum computation Extensions of topology to further areas of condensed matter, such as photonic and mechanical systems, topological quantum walks, topology in fractionalized systems, driven or dissipative systems. What tools does this course use? Simple thought experiments that rely on considerations of symmetry or continuity under adiabatic deformations Computer simulations similar to those used in actual research will give a more detailed and visual understanding of the involved concepts Dissecting research papers that teaches you to simply understand the idea even in the rather involved ones. This course is a joint effort of Delft University of Technology, QuTech, NanoFront, University of Maryland, and Joint Quantum Institute. FAQs Are there any books that are required for the course? No, the course will only rely on materials and software freely available online. Is it possible to get credit for this course at my university? Not by default, but we invite anyone to use the course materials as a basis for a graduate course, with course materials studied as preparation and followed by a classroom discussion. Such courses are planned at universities of Copenhagen, Delft, Leiden, and University of Maryland. Following such a course will obviously give you credit points. Would it not be better to take a more formal approach, and to describe the math in a more rigorous and systematic way? While advanced math is certainly relevant for some researchers, in our experience it is the simple things that are the most confusing. We aim for the course to stay accessible and relevant to advanced undergraduate/beginner graduate students, both the theorists and experimentalists. I do not know enough about condensed matter physics, but I have attended an exciting talk/read a cool article, and I'd like to learn more. Would the course be useful for me? We are not sure. On the one hand, we will aim the course at people familiar with basic condensed matter physics and the necessary math, hence we will always assume that we don't need to explain e.g. band structures from scratch. However, a good share of the course materials are just discussions which would give you some sort of overview and understanding what this is all about. Why didn't you discuss my favorite topic, which is certainly relevant and exciting? Hey, that's a great idea! We aim to start from covering the basic questions, and then let the course evolve together with the field. So if you want, please help us by preparing the materials that would be helpful for the course, and they will become a bonus topic. By the way, same holds if you spot an error, or know how to improve the course: everything about this course is open, so don't hesitate to contribute.

One way of answering this question is by looking through the lens of history, beginning with First Societies and extending to the 16th century. This course in architectural history is not intended as a linear narrative, but rather aims to provide a more global view, by focusing on different architectural "moments." How did the introduction of iron in the ninth century BCE impact regional politics and the development of architecture? How did new religious formations, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, produce new architectural understandings? What were the architectural consequences of the changing political landscape in northern Italy in the 14th century? How did rock-cut architecture move across space and time from West Asia to India to Africa? How did the emergence of corn impact the rise of religious and temple construction in Mexico? Each lecture analyzes a particular architectural transformation arising from a dynamic cultural situation. Material covered in lectures will be supplemented by readings from the textbook A Global History of Architecture. Join us on a journey around the globe and learn how architecture has developed and interacted with the world’s culture, religion, and history.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=47053</url></Course><Course><course_id>47062</course_id><title>Introduction to Management Information Systems (MIS): A Survival Guide</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>17</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Alfonso Durán Heras, Iván García Miranda, Jorge Solera Camino, Juan A.

This course is Part 1 of a 4-part series on Business Statistics, and is ideal for learners who wish to enroll in business programs. The first two courses cover topics in Descriptive Statistics, whereas the next two courses focus on Inferential Statistics. Spreadsheets containing real data from diverse areas such as economics, finance and HR drive much of our discussions.   In Part 1, we shall be exploring multiple ways to describe these datasets, numerically as well as visually. Throughout, we shall embrace a problem-based approach to understanding the material: the primary reason to pick up a tool or a technique will be to solve a problem. Our course makes judicious use of tools. In Part 2, we shall take up a few datasets that have over a million rows, which makes it impossible to analyze using a spreadsheet. This is a natural setting for R, an advanced statistical programming platform. The courses incorporate helpful tutorials to get learners acquainted with both the mechanisms. Parts 3 and 4 are dedicated to Inferential Statistics. In Part 3, we begin by exploring the benefits of random sampling, and apply the Central Limit Theorem to arrive at confidence intervals for important population parameters. We also learn how to formulate hypotheses for business data, and resolve them with the testing framework that we establish. Along the way, we shall compare two or more populations and draw inferences with a set of statistical tests. You will learn all these concepts with the help of various demonstrations, which show real-life application of the concepts related to business situations.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=69882</url></Course><Course><course_id>67526</course_id><title>Introduction to Solar Systems Astronomy</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>17</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Frank Timmes</instructor><school>School:  Arizona State University</school><description>In this introductory 4-credit hour lecture and laboratory course, we will explore the origins, structure, contents, and evolution of our solar system and exosolar planetary systems.

Mahometa</instructor><school>School:  The University of Texas at Austin</school><description>In this first part of a two part course, we’ll walk through the basics of statistical thinking – starting with an interesting question. Then, we’ll learn the correct statistical tool to help answer our question of interest – using R and hands-on Labs. Finally, we’ll learn how to interpret our findings and develop a meaningful conclusion. This course will consist of: Instructional videos for statistical concepts broken down into manageable topics. Guided questions to help your understanding of the topic. Weekly tutorial videos for using R Scaffolded learning with Pre-Labs (using R), followed by Labs where we will answer specific questions using real-world datasets. Weekly wrap-up questions challenging both topic and application knowledge. In this first of a two part course, we will cover basic Descriptive Statistics – learning about visualizing and summarizing data, followed by a “Modeling” investigation where we’ll learn about linear, exponential, and logistic functions. We will learn how to interpret and use those functions with basic Pre-Calculus. These two “units” will set the learner up nicely for the second part of the course: Inferential Statistics with a multiple regression cap. Both parts of the course are intended to cover the same material as a typical introductory undergraduate statistics course, with an added twist of modeling. This course is also intentionally devised to be sequential, with each new piece building on the previous topics. Once completed, students should feel comfortable using basic statistical techniques to answer their own questions about their own data, using a widely available statistical software package (R). Join us in learning how to look at the world around us. What are the questions? How can we answer them? And what do those answers tell us about the world we live in? Want to learn more?

However, only a tiny percentage of these texts have been edited and published. To gain access to the rest, you need to learn the art and science of reading medieval handwriting, This module of The Book: Histories Across Time and Space introduces students to the world of medieval paleography, the science of reading old handwriting. This particular module focuses on notarial handwriting from the city of Marseille in the 14th and 15th centuries. The module features household inventories, which identify some of the fascinating objects found in people’s houses. Assessments and quizzes will allow you to track your progress as you move from letter-group to letter-group. In addition to learning the handwriting, we will take special care to explore some of the many abbreviations and other elements of the secular registers of the later Middle Ages. Some knowledge of Latin or another Romance Language will be very helpful for understanding the texts you will read, but students without these language skills will still enjoy this chance to explore medieval handiwork.

Achieving this requires a deep understanding of current social problems and how policy is formulated, alongside the ability to tell that story in a manner that drives an otherwise apathetic public into action. The goal of this online course is two-fold: 1) to teach people from all walks of life how to use journalism and media as an implement of social change; and 2) have those students become effective change agents themselves. This class is not theoretical – students should be prepared to dig in deep and make meaningful contributions to policy change on a global level. This course equips students with the knowledge and skills they need to produce solution-based journalism – stories that give equal weight to problems and solutions. Throughout the course, students will view examples of outstanding solution-based journalism. The majority of these stories focus on vulnerable children. The umbrella of children allows us to explore the broad, but deeply interwoven policy areas concerning: communities, poverty, child protection, child maltreatment prevention, foster care, and the courts. At the same time, this course provides students with a platform to research, report on, and write about the policy and justice issues that fuel their own interests and passions, whether that involves immigration crises or poverty. Early on, students will share their interest areas with their classmates and start to share information and ideas. Students will then produce Final Stories on their topics of interest. Student work will be published throughout the semester and have a direct, immediate impact. Through precise, rigorous reporting and policy analysis, students will substantively contribute to public discourse, and by virtue of that contribution drive political will toward positive policy solutions to the myriad social issues that vulnerable peoples across this globe face. With that experience, students will be better prepared to use journalism and media for social change in whatever field they explore beyond the class.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=29194</url></Course><Course><course_id>29201</course_id><title>AP® Physics 2 - Part 1: Fluids and Thermodynamics</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>1</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Reid Whitaker, Matt Wilson</instructor><school>School:  Rice University</school><description>Preparing for the AP Physics 2 exam requires a deep understanding of many different topics in physics as well as an understanding of the AP exam and the types of questions it asks.

How can you position yourself as a leader through inclusive communication? How do you know that the message you are intending to send is what is being received? Join Catalyst experts to explore this topic and the important role communication plays in inclusive leadership. All too often, we struggle to communicate effectively—particularly with others who are different from us in some way. This course will show you how the most effective communication utilizes the inclusive leadership mindset of Empowerment, Accountability, Courage, and Humility and guide you on how to use that mindset yourself. Through research and real-world examples, you will learn strategies to enhance your communication skills and approach. Topics will include understanding dialogue processes, debunking everyday communication myths, testing assumptions, listening, expressing yourself authentically, and communicating across differences. With short quizzes, compelling case studies, and engaging videos, you will develop knowledge in each section and share your experience with other learners. Throughout the course, you will create a plan of action to help apply the strategies learned in this course to your work and other parts of your life.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=69528</url></Course><Course><course_id>51371</course_id><title>Classroom Strategies for Inquiry-Based Learning</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>1</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Kelli Allen, Shelly Rodriguez</instructor><school>School:  The University of Texas at Austin</school><description>Inquiry-based learning aims to increase student engagement by helping learners develop hands-on, minds-on skills. This education and teacher training course explores the 5E instructional model and its uses in the classroom. You will have the opportunity to learn from videos of classroom teachers modeling a 5E lesson and access teacher commentary as they use inquiry-based strategies with their students. As a result, you will develop the skills and strategies needed to implement inquiry-based instruction in your own classroom. An inquiry-based approach honors the complex work of learning. It prioritizes the knowledge and experience that students bring to the classroom and it promotes active problem solving, communication, and the shared construction of new ideas. Inquiry-based instruction is the foundation for the UTeach model. This education course serves as a useful introduction to this approach. You will have from June 1 through August 17 to complete the five-week course in a way that fits your schedule. You may also want to consider the self-paced version of Classroom Strategies for Inquiry-Based Learning that launches August 18th and runs through May 31, 2017.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=51371</url></Course><Course><course_id>45519</course_id><title>A System View of Communications: From Signals to Packets (Part 3)</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>1</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Bertram Shi, Shenghui Song</instructor><school>School:  Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</school><description>Have you ever wondered how information is transmitted using your mobile phone or a WiFi hotspot?

Es el tema más digno de ser meditado en esta vida y la reflexión más valiosa que puede asumir un ser humano para dar dignidad a su vida. Ser feliz y vivir feliz, son los dos  asuntos en los que nos jugamos nuestra existencia. Las reflexiones sobre estos temas las encontramos mejor planteadas y desarrolladas en los filósofos, porque ellos han concebido su actividad filosófica como una forma de vida válida para todos los seres humanos. Esta actividad se opone a las opiniones inciertas, engañosas y desconocedoras de la naturaleza humana que abundan en nuestro medio cultural y con las cuales se quiere cubrir la felicidad con un manto oscuro e inalcanzable para las personas. Tener una conciencia feliz, permite al ser humano realizar acciones éticas o morales igualmente felices. Este camino ético de la felicidad es el que andaremos en el desarrollo de nuestro curso y en el que cada uno de los participantes encontrará buenos argumentos para ser y vivir feliz cada día.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=51360</url></Course><Course><course_id>51370</course_id><title>Cellular Solids Part 3: Applications in Nature</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Lorna J.

However, just using a computer is only a small part of the picture. The real transformative and empowering experience comes when one learns how to program the computer, to translate ideas into code. This course teaches students how to do exactly that, using Snap! (based on Scratch), one of the friendliest programming languages ever invented. It's purely graphical, which means programming involves simply dragging blocks around, and building bigger blocks out of smaller blocks. But this course is far more than just learning to program. We focus on seven big ideas (creativity, abstraction, data and information, algorithms, programming, the Internet, and global impact), and six computational thinking practices (connecting computing, creating computational artifacts, abstracting, analyzing problems and artifacts, communicating, and collaborating). Throughout the course, relevance is emphasized: relevance to the student and to society. This fun, introductory course is not just for computer science majors, it’s for everyone… join us! “I am so grateful to have experienced BJC (Beauty and Joy of Computing). I took this course during my freshmen year at UC Berkeley, and it has actually changed my life. Because of it, I have switched to the computer science major and have even developed a passion for computer science education! This course showed me that computer science is creative, and it gave me the confidence to continue taking computer science courses. BJC's philosophy of inclusion, diversity, and collaboration is tangible and sets it apart from all other computer science courses that I have experienced. It is truly empowering!” -- Yifat Amir   Learn more about our High School and AP* Exam Preparation Courses  </description><url>/enroll?course_id=27199</url></Course><Course><course_id>34591</course_id><title>Effective Field Theory</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Saif Rayyan, Iain Stewart, Daniel Kolodrubetz, Evangelos Sfakianakis</instructor><school>School:  MIT</school><description>8.EFTx is an online version of MIT's graduate Effective Field Theory course. The course follows the MIT on-campus class 8.851 as it was given by Professor Iain Stewart in the Fall of 2013, and includes his video lectures, resource material on various effective theories, and a series of problems to facilitate learning the material. Anyone can register for the online version of the course, and students at MIT or Harvard can also register for 8.S851 for course credit. Effective field theory (EFT) provides a fundamental framework to describe physical systems with quantum field theory. In this course you will learn both how to construct EFTs and how to apply them in a variety of situations. We will cover the majority of the common tools that are used by different effective field theories. In particular: identifying degrees of freedom and symmetries, formulating power counting expansions (both dimensional and non-dimensional), field redefinitions, bottom-up and top-down effective theories, fine-tuned effective theories, matching and Wilson coefficients, reparameterization invariance, and various examples of advanced renormalization group techniques. Examples of effective theories we will cover are the Standard Model as an effective field theory, integrating out the massive W, Z, Higgs, and top, chiral perturbation theory, non-relativistic effective field theories including those with a large scattering length, static sources and Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET), and a theory for collider physics, the Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET). Course Flow Since this is an advanced graduate physics course, you will find that self motivation and interaction with others is essential to learning the material. The purpose of the online course is to set you up with a foundation, to teach you to speak the language of EFT, and to connect you with other students and researchers that are interested in learning or broadening their exposure to this subject. Each week you will complete automatically graded homework problems to test your understanding and to help you master the material. You are expected to discuss the homework with other people in the class, but your online responses must be done individually. To facilitate these interactions there will be a forum for student-to-student discussions, with threads to cover different topics, and moderators with experience in this field. Student learning and discussions will also be prompted by questions posed after each lecture topic. There will be no tests or final exam, but at the end of the course each student will give a 30 minute presentation on an EFT topic of their choosing. The subject of effective field theory is rich and diverse, and far broader than we will be able to cover in a single course. The presentations will create an opportunity for you to learn about additional subjects beyond those in lecture from your fellow students. To facilitate this learning opportunity, each student will be required to watch and grade eight presentations from among their fellow students. Of these eight, you will view 5 presentations that will be chosen for you, and you will view at least 3 more that you choose yourself from among the available topics. Since this is a graduate course we anticipate that learning the subject, and having the 8.EFTx materials available as an online resource will be more valuable to most of you than obtaining a grade. Therefore anyone who registers for the course will be able to retain access to the course materials after the course has ended. Since some of you may find a grade useful, we will compute a grade for everyone by using a combination of homework problems (50%) and your final research presentation project (50%).  For many of the course elements you may work at your own pace. The presentation project will be due December 16th.  For those following the suggested schedule there is a one-week break over the Christmas - New Years holiday, and two homework problems that are due in January. FAQ What do I have to buy in order to participate in the course? Nothing. All edX courses are free. The lectures, homework, and lecture notes are all available online. Will certificates be awarded? Yes. Online learners who achieve a passing grade in 8.EFTx will earn for free a certificate of mastery. These certificates will indicate you have successfully completed the course, but will not include a specific grade. Certificates will be issued by edX under the name of MITx. What textbook do I need for the course? In 8.EFTx readings will be mainly from a latex version of the lecture notes and freely available online arXiv research articles. Occasionally additional reading from commonly available quantum field theory textbooks will be suggested to supplement these free sources. When can I watch the lectures? You can watch the lectures any time at your leisure. Can I register to the class after the start date has passed? Yes, you can register at any time between the start date and the end date. To obtain the certificate, however, you will have to get at least 60% of the total available points for the class. I don't have the prerequisites. Can I still take the course? We do not check students for prerequisites, so you are certainly allowed to try. However, 8.EFTx does depend on experience with quantum field theory. Who can register for this course? Unfortunately, learners from Iran, Sudan, Cuba and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time. While edX has received a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to offer courses to learners from Iran, Sudan and Cuba, our license does not cover this course. Separately, EdX has applied for a license to offer courses to learners in the Crimea region of Ukraine, but we are awaiting a determination from OFAC on that application. We are deeply sorry the U.S. government has determined that we have to block these learners, and we are working diligently to rectify this situation as soon as possible.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=34591</url></Course><Course><course_id>68072</course_id><title>Bases Matemáticas: Derivadas</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Santiago Moll López, José Antonio Moraño Fernández</instructor><school>School:  Universitat Politècnica de Valencia</school><description>Este curso se concibe como una revisión de los conceptos básicos del cálculo diferencial, necesarios para los primeros cursos de aquellos estudios universitarior en los que se imparte matemáticas.

What is the logical relationship among data? How is data stored in computers? What algorithms are required to solve particular problems? These are the questions that will be answered in “Data Structures and Algorithms,” an important core course in Computer Science. The course also introduces students to fundamental data structures and classical algorithms used in more specialized courses, including Operating Systems, Software Engineering, Database Systems, Compiler Principles, Computer Graphics and Human Computer Interaction. Niklaus Wirth described the important and indivisible link between algorithms and data structure in his book, Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs. The course will build on Wirth’s ideas as it helps students improve their knowledge of theory and their ability to think abstractly to solve problems. Building on a solid theoretical foundation, students will analyze problems using data and algorithm abstraction. Students will learn how to organize data efficiently and make tradeoffs between space and time complexity, design efficient and effective algorithms, and implement high quality programs to solve complex real-world problems. After studying this course, students will be well prepared for further study and research in engineering and other computer-related areas. This is an intermediate-level course appropriate for sophomore students majoring in computer science or other science/engineering disciplines. Students should have learned "introduction to computing", with the knowledge of structured and object-oriented programming. This course is presented in two eight-week sessions. In session 1, we learnt Linear Lists, Stacks, Queues, Strings, Binary Trees, Trees and Graphs, which are fundamental data structures. In the second session, we will study advanced data structures and algorithms, such as Sorting, Searching, Indexing, as well as their applications thoroughly. More detailed, these chapters include a variety of classic Sorting algorithms (Quicksort, External Sorting), Searching methods (Sets, Hash Tables, Bitmaps), Indexing structures (B/B+ trees, Trie trees), Advanced List-Structure (generalized lists, Multi-dimensional arrays) and Balanced Binary Trees (AVL, Red-Black trees, Splay trees). The second part of the course lasts eight weeks. Each week, student will spend 4-8 hours to follow this course. Students who score 60% or higher will receive an Honor Code Certificate.

Each individual is unique and idiosyncratic. Yet, when we come together for a common purpose, we try to conduct ourselves in a manner that will achieve mutually desired outcomes. Sometimes we manage to achieve this; sometimes we don’t. Sociology is about that process. By understanding sociology and how we interact with each other, you can yield more personal and professional success. In this sociology course, you will learn about the social processes groups of all sizes follow to form, function and evolve over time. You will also learn about the ongoing dynamic individuals actively create in their social environment and how they are shaped by it. This course provides an understanding of how the formation and longevity of a society is possible when its members are diverse in their values, beliefs, preferences and agendas. You will learn about group dynamics, skills for effective interaction in groups and organizations, and obtain a deeper understanding of how sociology applies to everyday life and current events.

This course extends conventional sociology to foster an understanding of how the conditions of our everyday lives fit in with broader trends of continuity and change in regions across the world. We use the global garment industry as a vehicle for mobilizing our sociological imaginations, and follow the movements of capital, materials, and labor in the garment industry to examine the economic and cultural exchanges that keep our complex world in motion. Along the way, we’ll learn to critically read social scientific texts and construct evidence-based arguments. Klaus Lanstein, Group of People Walking Over World Map. Courtesy Getty Images.

Smart City has emerged as an interdisciplinary concept that covers different aspects related to big cities, including the infrastructure that enables communication between channels and entities for overcoming economic backwardness in a community, and for addressing differences between various urban and suburban zones. A dynamic model is observed that can be analyzed as a complex system. Since a city can´t be visualized in only one perspective, this course tackles some of its individual sectors to obtain the key performance indicators that are essential to improving the quality of life, including: urbanization, communication, education, and economy. Quantifying that data is useful for estimating consumed resources, forecasting shortages, and correcting damage in a timely manner. Once participants understand the importance of a Smart City and its classifications, they will learn to identify the impact of using metrics to measure its performance. A very important skill to develop is how to classify a metric and to identify its units or measure. The main focus of this course is to develop participants’ basic knowledge of a Smart City by being able to identify the parameters involved in its creation. Participants will also be able to define and establish the necessary metrics to measure the performance of a Smart City.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=45209</url></Course><Course><course_id>69532</course_id><title>Introduction to R for Data Science</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>405</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Filip Schouwenaars</instructor><school>School:  Microsoft</school><description>R is rapidly becoming the leading language in data science and statistics.

The objective of this course is to: develop and improve non-science students' scientific literacy so that students have some basic knowledge of chemistry, chemists thinking, problem solving understanding, expand their horizons and knowledge, understanding today Several major challenges facing human society association between the chemical and, thereby contribute to students' own career development. The main content of the chemical and the basic concepts of society, including chemical, organic chemistry, polymer chemistry, materials chemistry, environmental chemistry, geochemistry, energy, chemistry, biochemistry, food chemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry and household chemistry. At the beginning of the course, will briefly introduce some basic concepts and knowledge of chemistry, followed by some important branches of chemistry, and they are widely used in social life. Chemical originated in ancient mysticism. East and West Taoist alchemists in pursuit of immortality and endless wealth in the process laid the foundation for chemistry experiments, to develop a more systematic method and apparatus for chemical experiments. Although saver warlocks do not realize their initial goal, but they made one more great achievement, it is a chemical used as a science was born. Chemistry with theoretical and experimental basis for the broad application areas, after three hundred years of development, has become a pillar disciplines of human civilization. Recalling the history of human development, almost iconic during the progress of each civilization are closely related to the contribution of chemists. Metal fabrication technology, artificial ammonia technology, synthetic rubber and plastics and nano materials are first hand from the chemist, and therefore no exaggeration to say that the chemical is a cornerstone of human civilization.

The objective of this course is to: develop and improve non-science students' scientific literacy so that students have some basic knowledge of chemistry, chemists thinking, problem solving understanding, expand their horizons and knowledge, understanding today Several major challenges facing human society association between the chemical and, thereby contribute to students' own career development. The main content of the chemical and the basic concepts of society, including chemical, organic chemistry, polymer chemistry, materials chemistry, environmental chemistry, geochemistry, energy, chemistry, biochemistry, food chemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry and household chemistry. At the beginning of the course, will briefly introduce some basic concepts and knowledge of chemistry, followed by some important branches of chemistry, and they are widely used in social life. Chemical originated in ancient mysticism. East and West Taoist alchemists in pursuit of immortality and endless wealth in the process laid the foundation for chemistry experiments, to develop a more systematic method and apparatus for chemical experiments. Although saver warlocks do not realize their initial goal, but they made one more great achievement, it is a chemical used as a science was born. Chemistry with theoretical and experimental basis for the broad application areas, after three hundred years of development, has become a pillar disciplines of human civilization. Recalling the history of human development, almost iconic during the progress of each civilization are closely related to the contribution of chemists. Metal fabrication technology, artificial ammonia technology, synthetic rubber and plastics and nano materials are first hand from the chemist, and therefore no exaggeration to say that the chemical is a cornerstone of human civilization. The purpose of this course is not the culture and society of chemical chemist, but describes the chemical and its achievements, describing the discipline's past, present and future. Therefore, this course is like a "tourist spaceship", with students overlook this magical area, along a taste of the chemical in the most representative area. Through the study of chemistry and society, students can not only learn some basic knowledge of chemistry, the relationship can be the history and status quo of chemistry, chemical and society, current and future prospects of some hot issues in the field of chemistry and the chemical has a contour Formula understanding.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=35906</url></Course><Course><course_id>67562</course_id><title>Marketing Analytics: Price and Promotion Analytics</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>2</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Stephan Sorger , PE</instructor><school>School:  Berkeley</school><description>In this marketing course, you will learn how to price your offerings, as well as how to allocate your scarce marketing budget among different promotion vehicles to maximize their overall impact in the organization.

A deeper and mechanistic understanding of complicated biological processes can only come from the understanding of complex interactions at many different scales, for instance, the molecular, the cellular, individual organisms and population levels. In this course, through case studies, we will examine some simplified and idealized mathematical models and their underlying mathematical framework so that we learn how to construct simplified representations of complex biological processes and phenomena. We will learn how to analyze these models both qualitatively and quantitatively and interpret the results in a biological fashion by providing predictions and hypotheses that experimentalists may verify. 当现代生命科学研究变得更加量化，建立数学模型的需求变得越来越重要。对复杂生物现象的深入理解最终是建立在了解发生于多时空间尺度的复杂生物学相互作用上，例如，分子尺度，细胞尺度，个体和群体尺度上。通过研究一些案例，我们将建立一些简化的数学模型以及其背后的基本数学框架。同时，我们将学习如何建立基本生物学过程的简单表征，以及如何定量和定性和定量地的分析这些模型，并将它们的结果以生物学的方式进行解释，以期提供实验学家进行检验的假说和预测。</description><url>/enroll?course_id=48076</url></Course><Course><course_id>49803</course_id><title>Writing Case Studies: Science of Delivery</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Jennifer Widner, Pallavi Nuka</instructor><school>School:  Princeton University</school><description>This course introduces you to the main elements of a good “science of delivery” case study and teaches you how to plan your research, conduct interviews, and organize your writing.     The “science of delivery” begins with a simple observation.

The jury is an institution in some legal systems in which a panel of citizens weigh evidence and decide verdicts of court cases. “To jury” is, at its most basic form, to judge. It is an exercise in the deliberation of issues, persuasion, and the polling of results. JuryX: Deliberations for Social Change is an invitation to explore the concept of jury in both in theory and in practice, exploring both the political theory and history of the jury as well as techniques for engaging in juristic discussion. The course consists of six modules. In each module, you will begin by engaging with a case on your own, much like a jury views evidence, before engaging in small group discussions with your peers about the topic at hand. The course begins with historical legal cases and then moves to major contemporary issues. These include: decriminalization of marijuana in Jamaica and worldwide efforts to legalize, the potential for the Olympics and World Cup to advance education, individual identity and anonymity surrounding the NSA leak by Edward Snowden, and lethal police action against young black men, crystallized in the hashtag #icantbreathe. Deliberations will be real and virtual, synchronous and asynchronous.  Cases will be hosted on the edX platform, but deliberation groups will meet in a variety of media best suited to each group. The supported deliberation environment for online synchronous deliberation will be ‘Unhangout,’ a video-based discussion tool developed at the MIT Media Lab. Many other opportunities for gathering, deliberating, and returning results are also available, including face-to-face gathering and asynchronous deliberation online using open social media like Facebook and Loomio. JuryX: Deliberations for Social Change is ultimately about the most fundamental of human interactions: communication. By listening, speaking, persuading, and being persuaded, you will learn about yourself and your jury in relation to others.

Stark</instructor><school>School:  Berkeley</school><description>We are surrounded by information, much of it numerical, and it is important to know how to make sense of it. Stat2x is an introduction to the fundamental concepts and methods of statistics, the science of drawing conclusions from data. The course is the online equivalent of Statistics 2, a 15-week introductory course taken in Berkeley by about 1,000 students each year. Stat2x is divided into three 5-week components. Stat2.1x is the first of the three. The focus of Stat2.1x is on descriptive statistics. The goal of descriptive statistics is to summarize and present numerical information in a manner that is illuminating and useful. The course will cover graphical as well as numerical summaries of data, starting with a single variable and progressing to the relation between two variables. Methods will be illustrated with data from a variety of areas in the sciences and humanities. There will be no mindless memorization of formulas and methods. Throughout Stat2.1x, the emphasis will be on understanding the reasoning behind the calculations, the assumptions under which they are valid, and the correct interpretation of results. FAQ What is the format of the class? Instruction will be consist of brief lectures and exercises to check comprehension. Grades (Pass or Not Pass) will be decided based on a combination of scores on short assignments, quizzes, and a final exam. How much does it cost to take the course? Nothing! The course is free. Will the text of the lectures be available? Yes. All of our lectures will have transcripts synced to the videos. Do I need to watch the lectures live? No. You can watch the lectures at your leisure. Can I contact the Instructor or Teaching Assistants? Yes, but not directly. The discussion forums are the appropriate venue for questions about the course. The instructors will monitor the discussion forums and try to respond to the most important questions; in many cases response from other students and peers will be adequate and faster.

Mechanics is the study of how things move. It was the first quantitative science to achieve wide power to predict behavior, including things never before directly observed. Newton, Leibniz, and others invented calculus to describe motion and we will find both differential and integral calculus extremely useful throughout this course. This is the third in a 3-part series of courses that parallels the second-semester mechanics course taught at Harvey Mudd College. Part 3 focuses on the movement of oscillating systems and the propagation of waves (sound, seismic, or surface-water). Part 1 examined linear motion, and Part 2 examined angular motion. This course is an invitation to develop your problem-solving skills and to learn how to apply mathematics to all sorts of problems of the physical world. Learning the rules that govern how stuff moves in the world around us is exciting; using those rules to predict correctly something that you haven’t observed means that you really understand something. It‘s a great feeling. WHAT SHOULD I KNOW BEFORE WE START? You need not have taken physics before, but we assume that you have studied mathematics, up to and including a first course in calculus. You may be taking a calculus course concurrently with this course; that should be a good strategy. We will introduce important calculus ideas and methods as the need arises and provide examples. There is a Mathematics Diagnostic Test that you can take at the beginning of Part 1 of this series to ensure that your mathematics background will set you up for success in this course.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=41552</url></Course><Course><course_id>25638</course_id><title>Energy ─ The Technology You Must Know in the 21st Century | 能源 ─ 21世紀你必須了解的科技!</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Ching-Yao Chen</instructor><school>School:  Open Education Consortium</school><description>Energy technology is a highly multidisciplinary subject, which extends from engineering (e.g. mechanical, chemical, civil, environmental and electrical) to economy and ecology. This course is designed for students with limited engineering knowledge. It gives a broad overview of energy technology, mainly focusing on electric power generation. Before introducing technical aspects of power generation, impacts of excessive fossil fuel consumption to the environment, such as global warming, ozone depletion, acid rain and emissive pollutants, are addressed.

By combining theory and practice, the course not only aims to provide a clear view of the historical development of the music, but also emphasizes the training of aural skills and the accumulation of musical knowledge. The course covers not only classical music, such as neo-classical, expressionism, nationalism and other genres, but also explores in depth jazz, rock, and pop music of the 20th century. While studying Chinese music and other forms of national folk music in the 20th century world music context, students will also analyze large and complex works such as opera, musicals, and film music. By enhancing students’ understanding of 20th century Western music (classical music, pop music, folk music, comprehensive art) as a foundation, three core questions will be addressed: what is music, what is the 20th century Western music, and what is effective listening? The course aims to guide students to examine the three listening modes of 20th century Western music with the hope of forming a diverse and multi-faceted, knowledge and understanding of the 20th-century Western music culture phenomena, expanding students’ horizons, enhancing their ability to reason by analogy, and promoting cross-disciplinary, creative development. The course is one of the PKU-DeTao MOOCs, which is a joint effort by Peking University and DeTao Masters Academy. 该课程是“北大-德稻网络开放课程”中的一门，由北京大学与德稻教育联合提供。 How can I get access to reading materials? Please download the materials from designated websites. Western Music in the 20th Century is the main textbook.   如何获得课后阅读材料？ 在指定网站下载课后阅读材料，以《20世纪西方音乐》为主要教材。 How can I have access to the listening resources? Please visit the designated websites to complete the listening exercises. 如何获得课后聆赏素材资源？ 在指定网址链接点击课后指定聆赏的音视频资源。 How can I finish assignments? Written and listening exercises will be a part of this course. Please submit them to the specified mailbox after completion.   如何完成课后作业？ 课后作业依照情况而定，分为文字作业和聆听作业，完成后直接提交到指定邮箱。 What will the exams be like for this course? The exams will be open-book written assignments. 如何考试？ 考试将采取开卷考试方式，根据不同学生群体情况，或以论文形式，或以在线考试，或以作业完成情况最终确定成绩。 How will scores be calculated? The grading weights will vary per topics and tasks. Generally, all students can pass the course by completing all specified assignments. The passing score will be primarily decided by the final exam.  考试成绩的计算？ 不同学期课题，不同学习任务，教师将及时调整考试成绩的计算方式。一般情况，在完成课程所指定任务的前提下，学生可以百分之百通过考试。分数确定主要以期末考试为主，期中考试是否举行，以情况而定。 Can I submit graded assignments late? No. 如果考试方式是论文，是否允许延迟上交？ 绝对不允许。 How can I best engage with online learning for this course? Apart from the questions gained from the micro lectures, students can also get their questions answered via e-mail, and have access to the discussion forum and online interest groups. 在线学习如何进行？ 课程所提供的课前短课视 频系必读内容，在课后阅读、课后作业和课后聆赏完成过程中，产生的所有问题将被汇总，由教师或以文字邮件的方式或以视频短课录制的方式做出回答。此刻，教 师将根据学生的问题及时安排在线答疑、在线讨论，并发挥网络教学的便利，建立课程讨论区，组织兴趣小组 What is the role of the on-campus class for this course? The on-campus course will serve students who can attend the class for lectures, which are then recorded and released online. 教师课堂面授的作用？ 为服务可以出席面授的学生，本课程将在在线学习之外，安排固定时间固定长度的教师课程面授，教学活动将被录制，在线发布，以保证在线学习学生的需求。 Will I fail to keep up in the course due to my lack of understanding about the field of music? Our content is adjusted to a general audience.  课程是否会因在音乐领域积累不足而无法跟进？ 教师依照课程核心，一方面给出清晰课程线索，跟进不难，另一方面，教师尽可能调整课程内容，照顾到全体情况。根据以往的经验，课程结束，同学均可跟进课程标准，且不乏各样收获。 Are there content knowledge pre-requisites for this course? An earnest desire to learn and a proactive, professional attitude are more important than prior knowledge of content matter. The learners are expected to absorb the basic content points quickly and use them as a base for further learning. 课程内容秉持怎样的上课标准？ 教师保持一贯上课理念，认为专业，关于态度，不关乎知识，不会因同学不同程度，顾左右言其他，忽略最核心最关键知识点及问题的涉及。 Which is more important for this course, knowledge or ability? This course is most concerned on the development of music listening ability, though some knowledge of music will be helpful.  课程重视知识还是能力？ 课 程最关心音乐聆听能力的发展，在提供行之有效聆听技术的同时，安排适当知识内容的传授。加之考试不重知识，而重能力，因此，课程中因教室光线不足而造成无 法做太多笔记，恰恰是教师所希望的。课后传发同学的曲目说明，其中所标出的知识点，所指系能力而非知识。在音乐领域，所谓历史是听觉样本，即艺术品本身积 累起来的，而非人名和作品名串联起来的。艺术史，是感觉的历史，不是文字描述的历史。 What is the aim of the music puzzle assignment within the course? The purpose of the assignment is to prepare and develop audiometry and memory skills. 课程所谓音乐拼图作业的目的是什么？ 作 业的目的，在于听觉甄别力和记忆力的筹备与发展。相当于我们小时候玩得拼图或积木游戏，从局部观察到整体把握，这一训练所形成的对线条、形状、色泽等构成 物的甄别与记忆，不仅是视觉所需，也是发达听觉所必备。多数情况下，类似课程作业的练习，在中国音乐课程中，很少会有。之所以课程一开始便这样做，是因为 知道学生听觉的普遍问题。不少同学在实践之初，会遇到困难，这很正常，如果没有做好接受困难的准备，也就不必来此课程分享，也就不必来北大读书了。 Will the course provide information about music composition and technology? No. Music composition mastery requires long-term training, usually at a conservatory level. 课程是否可能或可以提供关于作曲的知识与技术？ 课 程不可能在作曲方面给予单独帮助，通过目前的教学方式，尽管正在探索，教师只能也必须照顾到最大多数同学的需求，这一难处，是客观的，请多谅解。关于作曲 四大件的技术发展，在音乐学院有一套完整的训练程序，乐理是入门，和声是基础，二者建立关于调性音乐系统的初阶。随后的复调写作，作曲系耗时约需一年甚至 更多，根据全面仿作练习，帮助同学发展多声思维和多声部操控技术。配器是第三梯度，约需一年时间完成，全面掌握乐队法。曲式分析，是封顶收官之课。将之前 所有梯队课程的内容，一并总结。 Will the course be available in English? The videos in the course will include English subtitles. However, the rest of the course content will only be available in Mandarin. 这门课程使用英语授课吗？ 视频中教师使用中文授课，有英文字幕，但是课程的其他内容，如阅读、作业题、讨论等都只用中文。</description><url>/enroll?course_id=3584</url></Course><Course><course_id>3584</course_id><title>Music in the 20th Century</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Bryan Minghui</instructor><school>School:  Peking University</school><description>Course videos are presented in Mandarin with English subtitles.

In the coming decades, pensions will become one of the cornerstones of economic and social policies in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). The reason?

This is the key question we will try to answer in this course. This architecture course takes you on a journey of understanding and appreciating the value of our everyday built environment. In the first two modules, we will explore the deeper socio-cultural meaning of rural vernacular architecture and look at the urban vernacular and challenges of people migrating from villages to live in cities; in module 3, we will focus on what we call ‘informal settlements’ in Asian cities; and in the final two modules, we will explore answers to a few questions that are very relevant to the current status and future development of vernacular architecture, such as: How can we conserve and sustain our vernacular cultural heritage? How can we reconcile tradition with modernity and originality? We will also cast our eyes into the future, and discuss how the field of vernacular architecture might evolve and develop in the years to come. Ultimately, the goal of this 5-week course is to help you establish your own viewpoints about the more complex or even contradictory issues in vernacular architecture, so you can make informed decisions regarding the protection and conservation of your local vernacular environments. Special note: This course can be taken independently from The Search of Vernacular Architecture of Asia, Part 1.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=69231</url></Course><Course><course_id>69231</course_id><title>The Search for Vernacular Architecture of Asia, Part 2</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  David P.

Video lectures will be in Korean, with English subtitles. Discussions, quizzes, and other course content will be in English. This course is the first part of International Politics in the Korean Peninsula; the second part will start this Fall. The course is introduced with two cases where politics brought tragedies: the hyper-inflation in Zimbabwe and the political idolization in North Korea. These two cases provide a good answer to why we study politics. The central content of the course is organized into two modules. First, it will start with several chapters from Records of the Grand Historian (Chinese: 史記), Plutarch's Lives, and History of the Three Kingdoms (한국어: 삼국사기; Chinese: 三國史記) to find out four archetypes of politics: value creation/distribution in a political entity, conflict and cooperation among political entities, development and maintenance of an identity in a political entity, and leadership selection in an entity. The second module of the course will link the four archetypes of politics with contemporary issues of inter-Korean politics and political events in North Korea. These issues will include the Korean Crisis in 2012, the arms race between the two Koreas, the power succession and the simultaneous (nuclear and economic) build-up strategy in North Korea, and upcoming political events. Course videos are presented in Korean with English subtitles.

However, in the scientific community, there is little controversy with 97% of climate scientists concluding humans are causing global warming. Why the gap between the public and scientists? What are the psychological and social drivers of the rejection of the scientific consensus? How has climate denial influenced public perceptions and attitudes towards climate change? This course examines the science of climate science denial. We will look at the most common climate myths from “global warming stopped in 1998” to “global warming is caused by the sun” to “climate impacts are nothing to worry about.” We’ll find out what lessons are to be learnt from past climate change as well as better understand how climate models predict future climate impacts. You’ll learn both the science of climate change and the techniques used to distort the science. With every myth we debunk, you’ll learn the critical thinking needed to identify the fallacies associated with the myth. Finally, armed with all this knowledge, you’ll learn the psychology of misinformation. This will equip you to effectively respond to climate misinformation and debunk myths.

Most traditional methods are of a repetitive, rule-based nature and will be gradually replaced by Artificial Intelligence. In the knowledge era, the most value added job will be to manage knowledge, which includes how knowledge is created, mined, processed, shared and reused in different trades and industry. At the same time, the amount of data and information (prerequisites of knowledge) is exploding exponentially. By 2020, IDC projects that the size of the digital universe will reach 40 zetabytes from all sources including, websites, weblog, sensors, and social media. Big data will transform how we live, work and even think. These trends and more will have a profound effect on how we see the world and create policies. In this course, the following topics are covered: What is knowledge management? How is knowledge captured, elicited, organized and created in business? What is big data and how can we use data analytics from a laymen perspective? What is Open Linked Data and how can it support machine reasoning? What defines the era of Science 2.0? How can new knowledge be mined from big data? What are the technical and social problems with big data? What is cloud computing and cloud services? What are examples of applications and case studies? The course is offered by the Knowledge Management and Innovation Research Center (KMIRC) of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Most of our research is company and industry based. Capabilities and competencies of the KMIRC are further strengthened by the international alliances it has formed with leading practitioners, many of which are regarded as members of the "Hall of Fame" in knowledge management, and renowned worldwide. The course is suitable for participants with a background in humanities, management, social science, physical science or engineering. No prior technical background is needed.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=69878</url></Course><Course><course_id>47680</course_id><title>Finite Element Method (FEM) Analysis and Applications</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>35</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Pan Zeng, Liping Lei</instructor><school>School:  Tsinghua University</school><description>Do you want to become an expert at structural analysis? Finite Element Method (FEM) is a powerful tool. FEM is an effective numerical technique for partial differential equations (PDEs) in engineering. The fact that modern engineers can obtain detailed information for structural, thermal, electromagnetic problems with virtual experiments largely gives credit to FEM. The finite element method provides infinite possibilities for engineering, and this course provides a detailed introduction of FEM and its applications in engineering and beyond. This course is divided into 15 lessons, which introduce basic equations of mechanics, mathematical principles of FEM, realizations in both discrete and continuum structures, various applications in engineering and skills at modeling with FEM software.

Latin American and Caribbean countries face considerable challenges in public management, such as the design of public policies that take into account different stakeholders’ points of view; citizen demands and scarce available resources; financial resource allocation; public service quality; and monitoring and evaluation; among others. Managing for development results and its managerial focus contributes to addressing these challenges through a comprehensive effort involving different stages of the public management cycle, the use of information for decision-making, and the use of multiple instruments and methodologies.

All stress isn’t bad, but chronic stress can take its toll on our minds, bodies, and behavior. Research has shown that people can learn and use specific resilience skills (such as optimistic thinking, relaxation strategies, choosing one’s attention) and positive routines (good sleep, scheduling in fun, and so on) in order to better manage stress, bounce back quicker after a setback, be more effective in their academic and vocational pursuits, develop stronger relationships with others, be physically and mentally healthy, and be satisfied with their lives overall. In short, resilience is ordinary magic and can be learned. It does not necessarily mean that you have to be born resilient or get lucky in life. The purpose of this course is to teach individuals the science behind becoming a resilient person. Stated simply, resilience is the ability to survive and thrive. Resiliency is not only about your ability to positively adapt in the face of adverse or challenging circumstances (that is, survive), but it is also about learning the positive skills, strategies and routines that enable you to live a happy, fulfilling, and meaningful life (in other words, thrive). This course gives you the permission to take care of yourself in order to effectively manage life stressors and do what matters most in life.  By the end of this course, you will have learned about the knowledge and skills that you can apply in your life now and in the future to be a resilient person. Course goal: The goal for this course is to give you permission to take care of yourself and empower you to be a resilient person. A resilient person is someone who: purposely strives to be as mentally and psychically healthy as possible, possesses the confidence to effectively cope with and manage stressful situations, is compassionate towards self and others, demonstrates grit or perseverance even in the face of adversity, and focuses on the positive and fulfilling aspects of life. Course supporting objectives: When you complete this course, you will be able to: Describe why ‘functioning from the inside out’ is critical to becoming a resilient, effective person Explain the benefits of resilience and how the specific skills translate into optimizing social-emotional wellbeing and doing what matters most in life Directly practice a variety of resilience skills in different aspects of your life, including but not limited to: Mindfulness practices Strategies to manage intense emotions Activities that induce positive emotions Clarifying important personal values (that is, what matters most) and committing to behaving consistent with them Making health lifestyle choices that are cheap and readily available, yet promote well-being Describe why ‘practicing’ and integrating resilience skills into one’s life is critical to making them a habit and becoming a resilient person Develop a resilience plan that serves as a roadmap for your future</description><url>/enroll?course_id=35742</url></Course><Course><course_id>69940</course_id><title>Digital Branding and Engagement</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>59</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Sonia Dickinson</instructor><school>School:  Curtin University</school><description>Want to learn how to get people to engage with your brand, but not sure where to begin?

But it also relates to what international organizations do and, increasingly, it concerns individuals, corporations, NGO’s and other non-state actors. As the world becomes more interdependent and more complex, and as new institutions are put in place to make international law real and more effective, international law is an exciting expanding field. Never before has it been so much relied upon, used and developed. Despite their differences in size, power, culture, religion and ideologies, states rely on international law to cooperate and to coexist; they speak the language of international law and international law serves them as an important common language. The course will extensively rely on judgments and advisory opinions of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations (UN). Having acquired this basic knowledge of international law, you’ll find it easier to study by yourself in books or through other courses or MOOCs some sub-fields of international law, like international humanitarian law, investment law, human rights or refugee law. So, if you want to understand what is international law, what role it plays in the world of today, how it can be used or if you want to be able to discern legal arguments within the flow of international news and reports, this course is for you.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=69239</url></Course><Course><course_id>45492</course_id><title>Solar Energy</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>55</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Arno Smets</instructor><school>School:  Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)</school><description>In the third edition of Solar Energy, you will learn to design a complete photovoltaic system.

What does sustainability mean in the business context? Why has it captured so much attention from academics as well as corporate leaders? How can businesses manage emerging sustainability challenges without compromising their core advantages, and transform themselves into 'sustainable enterprises'? This course explores the emerging relationships between sustainability issues and competitive advantage. Building on the basic concepts of strategic management, this course will explore how managers may effectively deal with the sustainability challenges that they now encounter. By encouraging you to reflect on these issues using multiple case studies, discussions and interviews, we will aim to enhance your understanding of alternative models of strategy development in the context of sustainable development.  </description><url>/enroll?course_id=47761</url></Course><Course><course_id>48087</course_id><title>IELTS Academic Test Preparation</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>51</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Iain Mathieson, Martin Dutton, Megan Yucel, Stephen Walker, Philippa Coleman</instructor><school>School:  University of Queensland</school><description>IELTS is the world's most popular English language test for those wanting to study in higher education in an English-speaking country.

Which customer is likely to default in his/her loan repayment? Which products should be recommended to an existing customer? Finding right answers to these questions can be challenging yet rewarding. Predictive analytics is emerging as a competitive strategy across many business sectors and can set apart high performing companies. It aims to predict the probability of the occurrence of a future event such as customer churn, loan defaults, and stock market fluctuations – leading to effective business management. Models such as multiple linear regression, logistic regression, auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), decision trees, and neural networks are frequently used in solving predictive analytics problems. Regression models help us understand the relationships among these variables and how their relationships can be exploited to make decisions. This course is suitable for students/practitioners interested in improving their knowledge in the field of predictive analytics.  The course will also prepare the learner for a career in the field of data analytics. If you are in the quest for the right competitive strategy to make companies successful, then join us to master the tools of predictive analytics.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=49420</url></Course><Course><course_id>34664</course_id><title>International Human Rights</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>42</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Olivier De Schutter</instructor><school>School:  Université catholique de Louvain</school><description>Human rights develop through the constant dialogue between international human rights bodies and domestic courts, in a search that crosses geographical, cultural and legal boundaries.

How have urbanisation, mobility, digital spaces, and globalization changed the way we perceive it? This course aims to help you feel comfortable with the notion of space. The simplest way to understand it is to connect your daily life, your perceptions and your practices to the concepts of contact and remoteness. In SpaceX, we will explore together the city, urbanisation, urbanity, and urbanism, the individual actor in a globalising World, the emerging digital spatialities, the space-time couple, and the complex relation between societies and bio-physical worlds. Moreover, we will see that cartography is a powerful tool. By the end of the course, we will enable you to not only read but also draw your own maps. Finally, the issues of action on space through spatial agency and spatial justice will be addressed. In each of the nine sessions, a recognised specialist will be filmed in a particular place—a ‘thinking place’—throughout the World, to help us simultaneously inhabit and understand space.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=45326</url></Course><Course><course_id>69548</course_id><title>Nanophotonic Modeling</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Peter Bermel, Haejun Chung</instructor><school>School:  Purdue University</school><description>This engineering course is an introduction to photonic materials and devices structured on the wavelength scale.

This course introduces the two primary methods used to determine the geometrical structure of molecules: molecular spectroscopy and gas electron diffraction. In molecular spectroscopy, molecules are irradiated with light or electric waves to reveal rich information, including: Motions of electrons within a molecule (Week 1), Vibrational motions of the nuclei within a molecule (Week 2), and Rotational motions of a molecule (Week 3). In the gas electron diffraction method, molecules are irradiated with an accelerated electron beam. As the beam is scattered by the nuclei within the molecule, the scattered waves interfere with each other to generate a diffraction pattern. In week 4, we study the fundamental mechanism of electron scattering and how the resulting diffraction images reveal the geometrical structure of molecules. By the end of the course, you will be able to understand molecular vibration plays an important role in determining the geometrical structure of molecules and gain a fuller understanding of molecular structure from the information obtained by the two methodologies.   FAQ Do I need to buy a textbook? No, you can learn the contents without any textbooks. However, if you hope to learn more on the subjects treated in this course, you are recommended to read the textbook introduced below: Kaoru Yamanouchi, “Quantum Mechanics of Molecular Structures,” Springer-Verlag, 2012.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=45227</url></Course><Course><course_id>69885</course_id><title>Learning From Data (Introductory Machine Learning)</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Yaser S.

Enhanced throughput: Almost all recently manufactured laptops and desktops include multiple core CPUs. With R, it is very easy to obtain faster turnaround times for analyses by distributing tasks among the cores for concurrent execution. We will discuss how to use Bioconductor to simplify parallel computing for efficient, fault-tolerant, and reproducible high-performance analyses. This will be illustrated with common multicore architectures and Amazon’s EC2 infrastructure.   Enhanced interactivity: New approaches to programming with R and Bioconductor allow researchers to use the web browser as a highly dynamic interface for data interrogation and visualization. We will discuss how to create interactive reports that enable us to move beyond static tables and one-off graphics so that our analysis outputs can be transformed and explored in real time. Enhanced reproducibility: New methods of virtualization of software environments, exemplified by the Docker ecosystem, are useful for achieving reproducible distributed analyses. The Docker Hub includes a considerable number of container images useful for important Bioconductor-based workflows, and we will illustrate how to use and extend these for sharable and reproducible analysis. Given the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you. If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology lectures. Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty relatively quickly across the first three courses. By the third course will be teaching advanced statistical concepts such as hierarchical models and by the fourth advanced software engineering skills, such as parallel computing and reproducible research concepts. These courses make up 2 XSeries and are self-paced: PH525.1x: Statistics and R for the Life Sciences PH525.2x: Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra PH525.3x: Statistical Inference and Modeling for High-throughput Experiments PH525.4x: High-Dimensional Data Analysis PH525.5x: Introduction to Bioconductor: annotation and analysis of genomes and genomic assays  PH525.6x: High-performance computing for reproducible genomics PH525.7x: Case studies in functional genomics This class was supported in part by NIH grant R25GM114818.

Plus précisément, les séries d'exercices seront accompagnées d'un corrigé au format PDF et certains problèmes bénéficieront d'une correction détaillée en vidéo, dans laquelle l'un des enseignants présentera la solution, étape par étape. Finalement, chaque vidéo de cours sera suivie d'un quiz, dont le but est de tester le degré d’assimilation des connaissances acquises. Le cours est organisé en dix chapitres dans lesquels une approche très détaillée des concepts théoriques est proposée, ainsi que de multiples exemples illustratifs : Systèmes d'équations linéaires. Algèbre matricielle. Espaces vectoriels. Bases et dimensions. Applications linéaires.   Matrices et applications linéaires. Déterminants. Vecteurs propres, valeurs propres, diagonalisation. Produits scalaires et espaces euclidiens. Matrices orthogonales et matrices symétriques. Cette deuxième partie du cours sera dévouée à l'étude des chapitres 5 à 8 cités plus haut. Une bonne connaissance de la matière enseignée dans le MOOC Algèbre Linéaire (Partie 1) est requise. Aussi, il est conseillé de travailler régulièrement et de manière assidue, de façon à ne pas prendre de retard lors de l'apprentissage de la matière. </description><url>/enroll?course_id=48810</url></Course><Course><course_id>69275</course_id><title>Visualizing Postwar Tokyo, Part 1</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Shunya Yoshimi</instructor><school>School:  The University of Tokyo</school><description>Tokyo emerged out of the ruins of war to become a large city of 10 million people in only a quarter of a century. During this process of change, the capital of a military empire that once invaded East Asia experienced occupation by the U.S. armed forces, hosted the Olympic Games, and transformed into a consumer hub where young people could enjoy economic “wealth.” It is important to know that this process was recorded in countless photographs, documentary films, TV programs, and so on. We will retrieve many of these archived pictures and videos and analyze what happened in postwar Tokyo from different perspectives. In Part 1, you will look at the changes that occurred in postwar Tokyo over a quarter of a century from four different perspectives: 1) occupation and Americanism; 2) imperial gaze and royal wedding; 3) The Olympic city; and 4) economic-cultural clash in Shinjuku. This examination of urban history will provide you with the insights necessary when considering changes in other large cities in Asia, such as Seoul, Beijing, and Bangkok, at the end of the twentieth century.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=69275</url></Course><Course><course_id>69270</course_id><title>Statistical Inference and Modeling for High-throughput Experiments</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Rafael Irizarry, Michael Love</instructor><school>School:  Harvard University</school><description>In this course you’ll learn various statistics topics including multiple testing problem, error rates, error rate controlling procedures, false discovery rates, q-values and exploratory data analysis. We then introduce statistical modeling and how it is applied to high-throughput data. In particular, we will discuss parametric distributions, including binomial, exponential, and gamma, and describe maximum likelihood estimation. We provide several examples of how these concepts are applied in next generation sequencing and microarray data. Finally, we will discuss hierarchical models and empirical bayes along with some examples of how these are used in practice.

This novel is among the first in major American literature to be written in dialect, characterized by regional Southern English. While this makes the writing difficult to understand at first, it also gives us a window into the language of the time. The story is noted for its colorful descriptions of people and places along the Mississippi River. Set in the American South after the Civil War, this book features a society that has ceased to exist about twenty years prior. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is often described as a satire on deep-rooted attitudes, particularly racism, in the South.   Participants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion. Course materials will include background information for understanding the text, as well as vocabulary and language support. Assessment will include quizzes and short writing assignments.   This is the second part of the BerkeleyX Book Club offerings.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=29219</url></Course><Course><course_id>69552</course_id><title>Introducción a la inversión bursátil</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Francisco Guijarro Martínez, Fernando García García, Javier Oliver Muncharaz</instructor><school>School:  Universitat Politècnica de Valencia</school><description>Este curso pretende dar una visión panorámica e introductoria de la inversión en bolsa.

Kellogg</instructor><school>School:  Berklee College of Music</school><description>Three things are clear about today’s music industry: The consumption of music is expanding at the greatest rate in history and from the most portals ever imagined, the cost of producing music is decreasing, and the number of artists creating and seeking to expose their work and develop careers through the Internet has increased dramatically. As demand grows and Internet piracy wanes, ad-supported and subscription models will generate unprecedented revenues that will surpass even the best of past earnings. And, many astute “music industry-watchers” predict a steep rise in business activity and trade earnings by the end of the decade. Whether you’re a music creator, consumer, or facilitator of this process, you’ll want to understand the history, underpinnings, and basics of the music business. This course has been developed to provide students with the latest instruction on the best way for creators, consumers, and facilitators to navigate the resurgence of one of the world’s most exciting industries: the music business. Course author John Kellogg—administrator, educator, entertainment lawyer, performer, and radio and television personality—offers students the opportunity to learn the fundamental principles of the developing new music business, for now and into the future.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=69865</url></Course><Course><course_id>3133</course_id><title>Fundamentals of Neuroscience Part 1: Electrical Properties of the Neuron</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>10</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  David Cox, Nadja Oertelt, Winston Yan</instructor><school>School:  Harvard University</school><description>Fundamentals of Neuroscience is a three part course that explores the structure and function of the nervous system -- from the microscopic inner workings of a single nerve cell, to the staggering complexity of the brain, and beyond to the social interactions and societal dynamics that our brains make possible.

Yet only 1 in 4 of us feel that our creativity is where we want it to be. Why should this surprise us? Almost none of us has ever been taught how to be inventive. This course is based on an extraordinarily successful program that has been presented at over 70 top American universities. Over the next 5 weeks Dr. Roberta Ness, an internationally renowned physician-scientist and an expert in innovative thinking, provides proven techniques to expand your originality. The method she will teach you is described by the acronym PIG In MuD: Define the problem, identify frames, generate all possible alternatives, incubate, meld to your best ideas, and disseminate. Your mascot will be Eggbert, an uptight, risk-avoidant pig who will learn a thing or two along with you. Along with Eggbert, you will sharpen your powers of observation, making surprising associations, expanding assumptions, pulling questions apart, and thinking backwards. Solving real-world problems in business and science, you will hone your creative thinking skills. In a final group project, you will be amazed by how creative you have become. Since the top projects will be voted up onto the home page and visible to all collaborating companies, you may even come across unique career opportunities when you and your ideas are “discovered.” The funding for this course was made possible by the UTHealth Innovation in Cancer Prevention Research Training Program (Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas grant #RP140103).

Maharbiz, Tom Zajdel</instructor><school>School:  Berkeley</school><description>EE40LX teaches the fundamentals of engineering electronic interfaces between the physical world and digital devices. Students can expect to cover the material of a traditional first circuits course with a project-based approach. We start with essential theory and develop an understanding of the building blocks of electronics as we analyze, design, and build different parts of a robot from scratch around a microcontroller. This course uses the Texas Instruments MSP430G2 LaunchPad, but you are welcome to bring whichever development board or microcontroller you like! Useful mathematics will be discussed where appropriate, but only a working knowledge of high school algebra is required to follow along for most of the course. The philosophy of the course is to learn by doing, so every lecture features a substantial lab component. Students are invited to work together in small groups to build their own robots along with the instructors. There will also be individual circuit analysis and design exercises to reinforce the theories presented in the course. Those who successfully complete each theory assignment and earn a passing grade will get an Honor Code certificate from BerkeleyX. Additionally, a kit of electronic components will be available from Newark element14 starting June 12. The kit is not necessary to obtain a certificate for this run of the course, but it will greatly enhance your learning experience. Some mechanical components are required to complete the robot as presented in the course. Also, the lab experience will be most effective if you have access to a digital multimeter. Creativity is encouraged! Students who are willing to work outside the bounds of the class to develop their own inventions will get the most out of this guided learning experience. MyDAQ Information Those who do not have access to an oscilloscope or a digital multimeter might consider purchasing a MyDAQ to enable measurements. The video modules use the MyDAQ and the MyProtoBoard as measurement equipment to debug circuits. National Instruments has made available the MyDAQ for students in this course. If you are interested, take a look at the MyDAQ ordering page: http://www.studica.com/us/en/BerkeleyMOOC.html Parts Kit Information The parts included in the construction of the robot can be purchased at Newark's landing page, which can be found here: http://www.element14.com/community/community/learning-center/online-learning/moocs/edxucb-bridging A detailed bill of materials with more information can be found here: courses.edx.org/asset-v1:BerkeleyX+EE40LX+2T2015+type@asset+block@EE40LX_PartsList_Summer15.pdf What is the format of the class? The class consists of eight modules. Every module consists of a combination of theory-based lectures and lab-based discussions where we apply that module’s theory to building a part of a robot. Quiz exercises are sprinkled throughout the videos to reinforce your knowledge and every module ends with a problem set that reinforces the design and analysis aspects of the class. Is this class taught at UC Berkeley? This class is part of the laboratory component of "EE40: Introduction to Microelectronic Systems," the first circuit analysis course at UC Berkeley. It was specifically designed for the online course format. What will the robot do? The bare-bones robot that we build will be capable of bouncing around, responding to light or touch inputs, and responding to a loud audio signal. What supplies and equipment will I need to get the most out of this course? In order to download programs to the MSP430 microcontroller, you will need access to a modern operating system (Apple, Windows, or Linux) with the Energia environment (http://energia.nu/download) installed. Additionally, access to some wire cutters and pliers would be useful. Also, the lab experience will be most effective if you have access to a digital multimeter. An oscilloscope would be useful, but not necessary. The NI MyDAQ has been made available for students who would like to follow along with the course. The robot project as presented also requires a few wooden craft sticks and two springs which can be found at a local hardware store. How much does the kit cost? The parts kit will cost around $50 USD for most parts. You are welcome to purchase a kit with another student and to work together on labs to split costs. We will also demonstrate other parts not in the kit for those interested in extending their projects. Will I need to know how to program? Sample programs are provided in each module that will allow you to test your own circuits with an MSP430 LaunchPad controller. These programs will be explained in optional videos for interested students. If you already know how to code, you can tweak these programs to add additional functionality to your project. Will this course cover microcontroller programming? No. Sample programs written in Energia, a high-level language, will be provided, but programming will not be explicitly covered. Students interested in learning microcontroller programming should refer to UT Austinx’s Embedded Systems course. What if I already have a microcontroller? Since analog electronics are the emphasis of the course, you should feel free to use any microcontroller you feel comfortable with. However, the use of any other microcontrollers would require you to write your own programs. Is there a required textbook? No textbook is required for this course. Handouts are provided for the concepts presented in the class; material for some of these handouts is taken from the 2nd edition of the book Circuits by Fawwaz Ulaby and Michel Maharbiz and we recommend the book as way to delve deeper into basic circuit concepts. We also occasionally provide links to web content that we find useful or informative.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=34596</url></Course><Course><course_id>34585</course_id><title>Introduction to Drinking Water Treatment</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>8</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Luuk Rietveld, Anke Grefte, Doris van Halem</instructor><school>School:  Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)</school><description>This course focuses on conventional technologies for drinking water treatment.

While Dickinson wrote nearly 2,000 poems during her lifetime, she chose never to publish, opting instead to revisit and revise her works throughout her lifetime.  Keeping this dynamic of self-revision in mind, we will consider a number of Dickinson’s poems—many seemingly in tension with one another—concerned with Nature, Art, the Self, and Darkness. We will travel to the Dickinson Collection at Harvard's Houghton Library, and to Amherst, Massachusetts, paying a visit to the house in which the poet lived and wrote until her death in 1886. Distinguished guests for this module include NBA athlete Jason Collins, dancers Damian Woetzel and Charles “Lil Buck” Riley, and President and CEO of the New America Foundation Anne Marie Slaughter, among others.   Led by Harvard Professor Elisa New, Poetry in America surveys nearly 400 years of American poetry. Through video lectures, archival images and texts, expeditions to historic sites, interpretive seminars with large and small groups, interviews with poets and scholars, and conversations about poems with distinguished Americans, Poetry in America embarks on a journey through the literature of a nation. Distinguished guests, including President Bill Clinton, Elena Kagan, Henry Louis Gates, Eve Ensler, John McCain, Andrea Mitchell, Michael Pollan, Drew Faust, Tony Kushner, and Nas, among others, bring fresh perspectives to the study of American Poetry.

FAQ What is the format of the class? The class will consist of lecture videos, brief exercises, and homework assignments. Each of the four segments of the course will have 2-3 lectures. Each lecture includes 3-5 lecture videos, which last between 10 and 20 minutes. There will be a brief exercise after each lecture video to help you test your understanding of the material.  Your score will be determined entirely by programming assignments for which you will receive immediate autograder feedback. You may submit your assignment to the autograder multiple times; only your last submission will count. Programming projects are to be implemented individually without copying code from other students, largely identical online resources, or previous instances of the class. However, short of posting or sharing actual explicit code, you are encouraged to collaborate and discuss problems in the discussion forums. Will the text of the lectures be available? Yes. All of our lectures will have transcripts synced to the videos. Do I need to watch the lectures live? No. You can watch the lectures at your leisure. You can "work ahead" if you want to move faster than the due dates. Conversely, you can progress at a slower pace. Please note that certificates will only be awarded to students who obtain the requisite score by turning in assignments by the established deadlines. How much does it cost to take the course? Nothing: the course is free. If you expect to be doing a lot of graphics programming in the future, we would recommend the OpenGL and GLSL programming guides, but it is by no means required to purchase them. There are many free online resources for these topics, and we will be posting links to them. What computer system do I need for the course? The course material involves C++/OpenGL/GLSL programming that is portable. We provide skeleton code for all major platforms (Windows, Mac OS, Linux). This is a modern course involving programmable shaders, but any machine built in the last few years should be adequate. We provide many compilation hints and tips, and Homework 0 is to ensure you can compile and work with the autograder. You do need some kind of C++ development environment; we provide several resources to get you started for Homework 0. In the highly unlikely event you cannot get your machine to work, you will hopefully have adequate time to find another system. Will I learn Maya/DirectX/3D Studio Max etc.? This is a course on the foundations of computer graphics and covers concepts, not the intricacies of a particular software package. That said, you will be able to write complex interactive and offline 3D graphics programs at the end of the course in C++, OpenGL and GLSL. Can I contact the Instructor or Teaching Assistants? Yes, but not directly. The discussion forums are the appropriate venue for questions about the course. The instructors will monitor the discussion forums and try to respond to the most important questions; in many cases response from other students and peers will be adequate and faster. I have a disability (visual/hearing etc.) Can I take the course? In most cases, yes. We provide transcripts for all lectures. Many leading computer graphics researchers have had visual impairments like color-blindness. However, this being a computer graphics course that relies on visual image comparisons, we probably cannot provide adequate support for those who are legally blind. I have a busy schedule this fall. Can I still take the course? The course does require about 12 hours per week of work, and the assignments (where you are given two weeks) require the time. Certificates of achievement require a passing score. Of course, you are welcome to just go through the lectures or attempt some of the assignments if you are not interested in a certificate; we hope to provide something for everyone.  </description><url>/enroll?course_id=45483</url></Course><Course><course_id>32031</course_id><title>Ressources naturelles et développement durable</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>6</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  An Ansoms</instructor><school>School:  Université catholique de Louvain</school><description>Ce cours sera enseigné en français.

Apollo 11 landed on the moon in 1969, just eleven years after the first successful satellite launch (Sputnik in 1957) and forty-three years after Robert Goddard’s launch of the world’s first liquid fueled rocket. But the history of rocket development actually can be traced back more than 2,000 years to the experiments of Archytas, an ancient Greek Philosopher. This aerospace history course will take you back in time and trace the many developments in technology that transformed rockets from celebratory accouterments to weapons and finally to launchpads for human space travel. It is a story of technology, but ultimately the emphasis on this course is about people. Some are very well-known, but others not so. You will learn how the Chinese introduced rockets as weapons, how early experimenters succeeded through trial and error, how scientific advancement provided the foundation for rocket development and space travel, and how rocket use spread throughout the world prior to the modern era. Finally, you will be introduced to the contributions of rocket pioneers such as Tsiolkovsky, Oberth and Goddard who dreamed of and paved the way for space travel. The course culminates with an introduction of German rocket development in the early 1930s and the emergence the genius rocket engineer Wehner von Braun.   Verified students are eligible to earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs) and Professional Development Hours (PDHs), valid toward continuing education requirements for many professional certifications.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=49998</url></Course><Course><course_id>65185</course_id><title>Introduction to Health and Wellness</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>6</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Punam Ohri-Vachaspati, Cori Lorts</instructor><school>School:  Arizona State University</school><description>This 3 credit health and wellness course focuses on the latest trends in health, nutrition, physical activity, and wellness.

We start by learning the mathematical definition of distance and use this to motivate the use of the singular value decomposition (SVD) for dimension reduction and multi-dimensional scaling and its connection to principle component analysis. We will learn about the batch effect: the most challenging data analytical problem in genomics today and describe how the techniques can be used to detect and adjust for batch effects. Specifically, we will describe the principal component analysis and factor analysis and demonstrate how these concepts are applied to data visualization and data analysis of high-throughput experimental data. Finally, we give a brief introduction to machine learning and apply it to high-throughput data. We describe the general idea behind clustering analysis and descript K-means and hierarchical clustering and demonstrate how these are used in genomics and describe prediction algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors along with the concepts of training sets, test sets, error rates and cross-validation. Given the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you. If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology lectures. Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty relatively quickly across the first three courses. By the third course will be teaching advanced statistical concepts such as hierarchical models and by the fourth advanced software engineering skills, such as parallel computing and reproducible research concepts.

In the past, scientists often tried to understand them by examining each constituent part. However, this approach was unsuccessful in many cases because the parts of any complex biological system can “interact” with each other and understanding such interaction is critical. In this biology and life sciences course you will learn about systems biology, a holistic approach to understanding biological complexity, focusing on how all of the parts of a system work together. This course will teach you the basic concepts of systems biology, including engineering principles and tools developed for dynamic systems (e.g., robots) to better model and understand biological dynamics. You will learn how simple math operations, addition and multiplication, can be used to model and simulate dynamic biological behaviors. Different types of “gene circuits” will be modeled and simulated using Octave Online, a web-based programming tool. This course is geared towards secondary/ high school STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) educators and students.

This course is Part 1 of a 4-part series on Business Statistics, and is ideal for learners who wish to enroll in business programs. The first two courses cover topics in Descriptive Statistics, whereas the next two courses focus on Inferential Statistics. Spreadsheets containing real data from diverse areas such as economics, finance and HR drive much of our discussions.   In Part 1, we shall be exploring multiple ways to describe these datasets, numerically as well as visually. Throughout, we shall embrace a problem-based approach to understanding the material: the primary reason to pick up a tool or a technique will be to solve a problem. Our course makes judicious use of tools. In Part 2, we shall take up a few datasets that have over a million rows, which makes it impossible to analyze using a spreadsheet. This is a natural setting for R, an advanced statistical programming platform. The courses incorporate helpful tutorials to get learners acquainted with both the mechanisms. Parts 3 and 4 are dedicated to Inferential Statistics. In Part 3, we begin by exploring the benefits of random sampling, and apply the Central Limit Theorem to arrive at confidence intervals for important population parameters. We also learn how to formulate hypotheses for business data, and resolve them with the testing framework that we establish. Along the way, we shall compare two or more populations and draw inferences with a set of statistical tests. You will learn all these concepts with the help of various demonstrations, which show real-life application of the concepts related to business situations.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=69882</url></Course><Course><course_id>69984</course_id><title>Industrias sostenibles y competitivas</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Carlos Fúquene Retamoso, Fernando Uzcátegui Ponce, David Hidalgo Carvajal</instructor><school>School:  The Pontificia Universidad Javeriana</school><description>Una compañía que pretenda ser sostenible debe pensar en generar un valor económico, social y medioambiental, en el corto y largo plazo, a fin de contribuir al aumento del bienestar y el progreso de las generaciones presentes y futuras.

The financial programming exercise simulates what IMF (International Monetary Fund) desk economists routinely do in their country surveillance and program work. In the first part of the course (modules 1–7), you will analyze the economic outlook of a country case and then help to build a baseline scenario — namely, a set of projections for the main macroeconomic sectors (real, external, government and monetary) that reflects the analyst’s best guess of what will happen to the economy in the coming year, assuming no policy change. In the second part (modules 8–10), you will learn and discuss how macroeconomic policies can be used to address poor performance and reduce macroeconomic imbalances. We will illustrate the workings of monetary, fiscal and exchange rate policies by using a simple Keynesian model of an open economy. In the final module you will design an IMF–supported lending program scenario for our country case.

Are you dealing with measurements or big data, but are you unsure about how to proceed? This is the course that teaches you how to find the best estimates of the unknown parameters from noisy observations. You will also learn how to assess the quality of your results. TU Delft’s approach to observation theory is world leading and based on decades of experience in research and teaching in geodesy and the wider geosciences. The theory, however, can be applied to all the engineering sciences where measurements are used to estimate unknown parameters. The course introduces a standardized approach for parameter estimation, using a functional model (relating the observations to the unknown parameters) and a stochastic model (describing the quality of the observations). Using the concepts of least squares and best linear unbiased estimation (BLUE), parameters are estimated and analyzed in terms of precision and significance. The course ends with the concept of overall model test, to check the validity of the parameter estimation results using hypothesis testing. Emphasis is given to develop a standardized way to deal with estimation problems. Most of the course effort will be on examples and exercises from different engineering disciplines, especially in the domain of Earth Sciences. This course is aimed towards Engineering and Earth Sciences students at Bachelor’s, Master’s and postgraduate level.   LICENSE The course materials of this course are Copyright Delft University of Technology and are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=69242</url></Course><Course><course_id>69546</course_id><title>Food Security and Sustainability: Systems thinking and environmental sustainability</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Gerrie van de Ven, I.J.M. de Boer, Carolien Kroeze, Eddie Bokkers, Martin van Ittersum</instructor><school>School:  Wageningen University</school><description>Understanding and working with the complexity of sustainable food production systems requires training in different disciplines and an approach that can address this complexity at the system level.

Computing has profoundly changed the world, opening up wonderful new ways for people to connect, design, research, play, create, and express themselves. However, just using a computer is only a small part of the picture. The real transformative and empowering experience comes when one learns how to program the computer, to translate ideas into code. This course teaches students how to do exactly that, using Snap! (based on Scratch), one of the friendliest programming languages ever invented. It's purely graphical, which means programming involves simply dragging blocks around, and building bigger blocks out of smaller blocks. But this course is far more than just learning to program. We focus on seven big ideas (creativity, abstraction, data and information, algorithms, programming, the Internet, and global impact), and six computational thinking practices (connecting computing, creating computational artifacts, abstracting, analyzing problems and artifacts, communicating, and collaborating). Throughout the course, relevance is emphasized: relevance to the student and to society. This fun, introductory course is not just for computer science majors, it’s for everyone… join us!

How can economic policy help support or restore health to the economy? These questions are at the heart of financial programming. In our FPP courses you will learn the building blocks of how to answer to these questions. Financial programming is a framework to analyze the current state of the economy, forecast where the economy is headed, and identify economic policies that can change the course of the economy. In Part 1 of the FPP sequence, presented by IMF's Institute for Capacity Development, you will learn the basic skills required to conduct financial programming. The course presents the principal features of the four main sectors that comprise the macroeconomy (real, fiscal, external, and monetary); demonstrates how to read, interpret, and analyze the accounts for these sectors; and illustrates how these sectors are interlinked. (Part 2 of the FPP sequence will cover preparation of a baseline forecast and design of an adjustment program.) During the course, economists from the IMF will lead you through the accounts and analysis of an economy. Besides engaging with lecture videos, you will answer questions on the concepts explained, solve short numerical exercises, discuss with fellow participants economic developments in your country, and work with data for a hypothetical country. The reading material will be provided to you. Whether you are a civil servant working on economic issues for your country, a professional working with economic data, or simply interested in better understanding the developments of an economy, this course will provide hands-on training on macroeconomic analysis. We hope that you will join us in this exciting journey! Financial Programming and Policies, Part 1 is offered by the IMF with financial support from the Government of Belgium.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=67559</url></Course><Course><course_id>65200</course_id><title>Windows 10 Features for a Mobile Workforce: Identity Management and Data Access</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Philip E.

Workers expect consistent access to corporate tools and data regardless of the type of device they’re using. They also want their corporate-issued technology and resources to look and behave like their personal technology—always on and always available from any device, from virtually anywhere. An enterprise model that supports the use of consumer devices in the workplace and the ability to work from virtually anywhere and anytime must move from a device-focused view of IT management to one that’s people centric. In reality it is not the device that is mobile, it is the users. It is important that the IT challenges of BYOD, Mobile device management, cloud computing, and hybrid identities be understood before one can understand how Windows 10 helps address those issues.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=65200</url></Course><Course><course_id>51182</course_id><title>Sensing Planet Earth – Water and Ice</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Thomas Hobiger, Gisela Carvajal, Leif Eriksson, Rüdiger Haas, Anders Berg</instructor><school>School:  Chalmers University of Technology</school><description>Global warming.

This course is part of the XSeries, Civil War and Reconstruction, which introduces students to the most pivotal era in American history. The Civil War transformed the nation by eliminating the threat of secession and destroying the institution of slavery. It raised questions that remain central to our understanding of ourselves as a people and a nation – the balance of power between local and national authority, the boundaries of citizenship, and the meanings of freedom and equality. The XSeries will examine the causes of the war, the road to secession, the conduct of the Civil War, the coming of emancipation, and the struggle after the war to breathe meaning into the promise of freedom for four million emancipated slaves. One theme throughout the XSeries is what might be called the politics of history – how the world in which a historian lives affects his or her view of the past, and how historical interpretations reinforce or challenge the social order of the present.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=24898</url></Course><Course><course_id>29204</course_id><title>AP® Physics 2 – Part 4: AP Review and Exam Preparation</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Reid Whitaker, Matt Wilson</instructor><school>School:  Rice University</school><description>Preparing for the AP Physics 2 exam requires a deep understanding of many different topics in physics as well as an understanding of the AP exam and the types of questions it asks.

Computing has profoundly changed the world, opening up wonderful new ways for people to connect, design, research, play, create, and express themselves. However, just using a computer is only a small part of the picture. The real transformative and empowering experience comes when one learns how to program the computer, to translate ideas into code. This course teaches students how to do exactly that, using Snap! (based on Scratch), one of the friendliest programming languages ever invented. It's purely graphical, which means programming involves simply dragging blocks around, and building bigger blocks out of smaller blocks. But this course is far more than just learning to program. We focus on seven big ideas (creativity, abstraction, data and information, algorithms, programming, the Internet, and global impact), and six computational thinking practices (connecting computing, creating computational artifacts, abstracting, analyzing problems and artifacts, communicating, and collaborating). Throughout the course, relevance is emphasized: relevance to the student and to society. This fun, introductory course is not just for computer science majors, it’s for everyone… join us!

Ha habido numerosos episodios de recesiones profundas, crisis bancarias, inflación desbordada y escasez de divisas. Todos estos factores afectan la calidad de vida en América Latina. En realidad, sólo con mayores niveles de crecimiento sostenido a través del tiempo, es posible pensar que América Latina supere la pobreza y mejore el nivel de vida de la región. Este curso analiza los principales desafíos que la región enfrenta en cuanto a su crecimiento económico y estabilidad macro-económica. Los contenidos serán presentados en un lenguaje simple y comprensible para todos aquellos participantes que no son especialistas en el área temática. Este curso pretende abordar las siguientes preguntas: ¿Cuáles son los desafíos que enfrentan los países en América Latina y el Caribe para incrementar sus niveles de inversión privada?  ¿Por qué la productividad en la región es más baja comparada con la de otras regiones? ¿Cuáles son los principales desafíos que enfrenta la infraestructura, sea ésta la relacionada con agua y saneamiento básico, el transporte o la energía, para mencionar algunos sectores? ¿Por qué los recursos naturales, que abundan en la región, no siempre han dado los resultados esperados para propiciar el desarrollo regional? ¿Cómo se originan la inestabilidad económica y las crisis macro-económicas? ¿Cuál es el rol de las políticas monetarias, cambiarias y financieras para alcanzar estabilidad macro-económica?

There have been major recessions, bank crises, excessive inflation, and currency shortages. All of these factors affect the quality of life in Latin America. In reality, only with higher levels of economic growth sustained over time will it be possible for Latin America to overcome poverty and improve the region’s quality of life. This course analyzes the main challenges the region faces regarding economic growth and macroeconomic stability in simple and understandable language for those who are not specialists in the subject area. This course aims to address the following questions: What challenges do Latin American countries face in reaching increased private investment?  Why is the region's productivity lower than other regions? What are the main infrastructural challenges related to water and basic sanitation, transportation, energy, and other sectors? Why haven't the natural resources, abundant in the region, always provided the expected results to contribute to regional development? How did the region’s economic instability and macroeconomic crises originate? What is the role of monetary, exchange rate, and financial policies in achieving macroeconomic stability?

Every aspect of human activity depends on it. All IT processes, whether they drive mobile phones, the Internet, transportation systems, enterprise systems, publishing, social networks or any other application, rely on software. In this new and improved version of the course, you will learn to write software with a progressive hint system for first time programmers. The core skill is programming; not just the ability to piece together a few “lines of code,” but writing quality programs, which will do their job right, and meet the evolving needs of their users. Anyone can write a program; this course teaches you to write good programs. The course starts from the basics of computing and takes you through a tour of modern object-oriented programming, including classes, objects, control structures, inheritance, polymorphism, and genericity. Throughout the course, you will have the opportunity to learn the principles of programming as well as the techniques for designing correct and reliable programs by using the Eiffel programming language and notation. You will be trying out example problems to provide your solution, and see it immediately compiled and tested from within your browser. To this end, we are using the Codeboard;web-based IDE, developed at the Chair of Software Engineering (ETH Zurich).  Beyond programming, you will also get a glimpse at theoretical computer science, the set of mathematical techniques that underlie computation and makes today’s IT-based world possible. In this third edition of the course we specifically focus on helping students with little or no programming experience. To this end, we have improved the introductory material about the Eiffel language, and we have implemented a progressive hint system students can use to get guidance on how to solve the programming exercises. "Really good course. Followed it with a couple of experienced colleagues all of them having a computer science background. They really liked the concepts and programming in Eiffel a lot.

If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology lectures. Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty relatively quickly across the first three courses. By the third course will be teaching advanced statistical concepts such as hierarchical models and by the fourth advanced software engineering skills, such as parallel computing and reproducible research concepts. These courses make up 2 XSeries and are self-paced: PH525.1x: Statistics and R for the Life Sciences PH525.2x: Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra PH525.3x: Statistical Inference and Modeling for High-throughput Experiments PH525.4x: High-Dimensional Data Analysis PH525.5x: Introduction to Bioconductor: annotation and analysis of genomes and genomic assays  PH525.6x: High-performance computing for reproducible genomics PH525.7x: Case studies in functional genomics This class was supported in part by NIH grant R25GM114818.

However, at the university level and in industry, we learn that science is not as simple as we once thought. We are constantly confronted by questions about the unknown and required to use creative, integrated approaches to solve these problems. By bringing together knowledge from multidisciplinary fields, we are empowered with the ability to generate new ideas. The goal of this course is to develop skills for generating new ideas at the interface between chemistry and biology by analyzing pioneering studies. When should I register? Registration will be open throughout the course. However, if a learner wants to receive a certificate, he/she should register by the end of April.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=6825</url></Course><Course><course_id>16431</course_id><title>China (Part 4): Literati China: Examinations and Neo-Confucianism</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Peter K.

In postwar Tokyo, countless gazes fell upon others; gazes from and upon Americans and the Emperor, gazes going up skyscrapers or rushing aggressively through the cityscape, and gazes twining and wriggling among classes, genders, and ethnic groups in downtown Tokyo. In Part 2, we will focus on the geopolitics of these gazes in modern Tokyo. What kinds of gazes fell upon the war orphans, the poor, and the marginalized groups in Tokyo? How did students themselves, who represented the vast accumulation of knowledge in Tokyo, perform in front of these gazes? Moreover, how did cinema or television shows, as media for these gazes, implicate the whole city? In answering these questions, we will identify the geopolitics historically involved in the practice of “visualizing postwar Tokyo.”  </description><url>/enroll?course_id=69276</url></Course><Course><course_id>51559</course_id><title>Data Structures and Algorithm Design Part II 数据结构与算法设计(下)</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Junhui Deng</instructor><school>School:  Tsinghua University</school><description>Data structures play a central role in computer science and are the cornerstones of efficient algorithms.

It was published in 1847 under her pen name, Currer Bell. Jane Eyre is often referred to as a bildungsroman, or coming-of-age story. It follows the feelings and experiences of the protagonist and title character, Jane Eyre, from youth to adulthood.  The story has both elements of social criticism as well as a strong moral core. Many critics have considered this book to be ahead of its time, mostly due to Jane’s individualism, as well as story themes that include classism, sexuality, religion, and feminism. Participants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion. Course materials will include background information for understanding the text, as well as vocabulary and language support.

Computing has profoundly changed the world, opening up wonderful new ways for people to connect, design, research, play, create, and express themselves. However, just using a computer is only a small part of the picture. The real transformative and empowering experience comes when one learns how to program the computer, to translate ideas into code. This course teaches students how to do exactly that, using Snap! (based on Scratch), one of the friendliest programming languages ever invented. It's purely graphical, which means programming involves simply dragging blocks around, and building bigger blocks out of smaller blocks. But this course is far more than just learning to program. We focus on seven big ideas (creativity, abstraction, data and information, algorithms, programming, the Internet, and global impact), and six computational thinking practices (connecting computing, creating computational artifacts, abstracting, analyzing problems and artifacts, communicating, and collaborating). Throughout the course, relevance is emphasized: relevance to the student and to society. This fun, introductory course is not just for computer science majors, it’s for everyone… join us!

At MIT, the content of the five modules makes the first of a two-semester sequence (8.421 and 8.422) for graduate students interested in Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics. This sequence is required for Ph.D. students doing research in this field. In these modules you will learn about the interaction of radiation with atoms: resonance; absorption, stimulated and spontaneous emission; methods of resonance, dressed atom formalism, masers and lasers, cavity quantum electrodynamics; structure of simple atoms, behavior in very strong fields; fundamental tests: time reversal, parity violations, Bell's inequalities; and experimental methods. Completing the two-course sequence allows you to pursue advanced study and research in cold atoms, as well as specialized topics in condensed matter physics.   FAQ Who can register for this course? Unfortunately, learners from Iran, Cuba, Sudan and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time. While edX has received a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to offer courses to learners from Iran and Sudan our license does not cover this course. Separately, EdX has applied for a license to offer courses to learners in the Crimea region of Ukraine, but we are awaiting a determination from OFAC on that application. We are deeply sorry the U.S. government has determined that we have to block these learners, and we are working diligently to rectify this situation as soon as possible.

Join the Smithsonian, and comic book industry legend Stan Lee, to explore the history of the comic book and the rise of superheroes. The ancient gods of Egyptian, Greek and Roman myths still exist, but today, they have superpowers, human foibles and secret identities. They come from comic books and graphic novels, and have taken over pop culture on the stage, screen, video games, and animation.   From Superman® and Spider-Man®, to The Avengers® and The Hulk® and beyond, who are these heroes? And, how have they evolved from folklore and myth, across all cultures and religions?   Learn from Smithsonian and industry experts including: Stan Lee, who was one of the creators of the modern superhero template. His early comics featuring Spider-Man, Iron Man®, The Hulk, Thor®, and The Avengers led Marvel to success. He continues to reinvent himself to create modern global superheroes and appear in cameos in superhero films and TV, such as Avengers: Age of Ultron. Michael Uslan, executive producer of top grossing, award winning movies, including The Dark Knight series, Lego® Movie, the animated Batman films and Batman® VS Superman.  In this course, we explore the following questions: Why did superheroes first arise in 1938 and experience what we refer to as their “Golden Age” during World War II? Why did the superhero genre ebb and flow in popularity over the decades? How have comic books, published weekly since the mid-1930’s, mirrored a changing American society, reflecting our mores, slang, fads, biases and prejudices?  Why was the comic book industry nearly shut down in the McCarthy Era of the 1950’s?  How did our superheroes become super-villains in the eyes of the government, clergy, educators, and parents of the mid-20th Century?  When and how did comic books become acceptable again, and eventually become valid teaching tools in universities and schools?  When and how did comic book artwork become accepted as a true American art form as indigenous to this country as jazz?  Finally, when and how did comic books become “cool” and the basis for blockbuster movies, hit TV series, top-selling video games, and acclaimed animation, while also impacting fashion and style- and even the moral and ethical codes of children- around the globe? For the first time ever, the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History is excited to offer the opportunity to go into the collection and see why superheroes are a dominant cultural force in today’s world. As you learn about how cultural myths, world events, and personal experiences shaped the first superheroes, you will apply these frameworks to create your own superhero– or you can choose to do a deeper analysis on existing comic book heroes. This original project is required for certification and anything created by you as part of the course is the intellectual property of you and you alone.  At the end of the course, you will have the opportunity to take your final project work and participate with other current and alumni students in a two week “team track add-on" to the course.  At last, fans, students and seekers of knowledge have the opportunity to enroll in the ultimate comic book course.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=69200</url></Course><Course><course_id>69201</course_id><title>Introduction to Banking and Financial Markets - I</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  PC Narayan</instructor><school>School:  Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore</school><description>Banking and financial markets encompass the ‘ecosystem’ that (a) channelizes money from those who have it (i.e., savers/investors) to those who need it (i.e., borrowers) and (b) facilitate cross-border flow of funds through exchange of currencies. That ecosystem of banks and financial markets (including Central Banks) has deepened in size, sophistication and complexity over the years. However, in recent times they have also been the subject of abuse, failures and economic distress in several countries resulting in a ‘contagion’ that has concurrently impacted several countries around the World!  More recently, and perhaps more importantly, thanks to the liberalization of most economies, the world has witnessed an exponential increase in the free flow of capital across countries. Banking institutions and financial markets, being the predominant conduit for such free flow of capital across countries, have therefore become even more ‘globally interconnected’. Such a globally interconnected financial system, combined with regulatory systems that are country-specific and hence varying considerably in rigor and implementation, has further compounded the risks and the consequent contagion, as witnessed in the global financial meltdown that was triggered in 2008. This course titled “Introduction to Banking and Financial Markets” will be delivered in two parts. The first part will help you demystify the role of banking and financial markets in any country, the products and services they offer and the underlying market mechanisms. The second part of the course will examine the risks embedded in banking and financial markets, how these risks have been heightened because of a globally interconnected world and the regulatory and governance mechanisms to minimize adverse outcomes in such a complex system.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=69201</url></Course><Course><course_id>14421</course_id><title>China (Part 3): Cosmopolitan Tang: Aristocratic Culture</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Peter K.

First, the basic concepts of systems, dynamics, structure and control are introduced. Then, looking at many examples in Nature and human made devices, we will realize that the dynamic behavior of most systems can be modified by adding a control system. Later we will see how knowing how to evaluate the dynamic behavior of a system and measure its performance will provide the tools to design new controlled systems fulfilling some requirements. By considering which are the benefits of control and the challenges for the future we will open the mind to tackle new applications and develop new scenarios from the micro-systems level to the common systems and the whole universe. An overview of the techniques available for a deeper introduction to the subject will be presented at the end. Control technology is said to be a hidden technology. We do not notice it under normal operation, but it appears if a failure happens. Looking around in Nature and at human made devices, we realize that their behavior presents analogies and that we can manipulate their temporal evolution. Characterizing the dynamic behavior of systems and the possibility to change it by introducing control devices is the main aim of the course. You will learn to analyze the dynamic properties of a system and the options to change its behavior according to some requirements.You will learn the basic concepts to undertake further studies in control engineering and its use in a variety of disciplines, from human and social sciences to any engineering field. </description><url>/enroll?course_id=69521</url></Course><Course><course_id>68045</course_id><title>Stress Testing and Risk Regulation – Part 1</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Anton Theunissen</instructor><school>School:  NYIF</school><description>This economics and finance course surveys developments in the area of prudential risk regulation with particular emphasis on stress testing as the primary tool of regulation.

Eliot, Marianne Moore, Langston Hughes, William Carlos Williams, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Claude McKay, Dorothy Parker, and Wallace Stevens. We will study how these poets employed the language of rejection and revolution, of making and remaking, of artistic appropriation and cultural emancipation. Traveling to the homes and workplaces of Robert Frost and Wallace Stevens; to the Poetry Foundation in Chicago, where the institution of American Modernism was born; and even exploring the River Thames in the London of Eliot's THE WASTE LAND, we will see the sites that witnessed—and cultivated—the rise of American Modernism.   Led by Harvard Professor Elisa New, the Poetry in America series surveys nearly 400 years of American poetry. Through video lectures, archival images and texts, expeditions to historic sites, interpretive seminars with large and small groups, interviews with poets and scholars, and conversations about poems with distinguished Americans, Poetry in America takes learners on a journey through the literature of a nation. Along the way, distinguished guests including Elena Kagan, Henry Louis Gates, Eve Ensler, John McCain, Andrea Mitchell, Michael Pollan, Drew Faust, Tony Kushner, and Nas, among others, bring fresh perspectives to the study of American poetry.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=51365</url></Course><Course><course_id>51183</course_id><title>Cellular Solids Part 2: Applications in Medicine</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Lorna J.

Shiakolas</instructor><school>School:  University of Texas at Arlington</school><description>The goal of this course is to provide high school students and college freshman a broad outline of engineering and help them decide on a career in engineering. The first part of this course is focused on exploring the different disciplines of engineering and providing participants with a broad background in different areas of engineering.   Do you want to learn how race-cars are built? How robots are able to work independently? How unmanned vehicles are designed and built? How is energy harvested? How is energy stored? How are organs built? How is the body imaged? How do you design an aircraft? How do electrons travel in micro and nanoelectronics? How are drugs delivered in the body? How do you build on soils that are unstable? How do robots see? How is light used in devices? How is data stored and managed? How is pollution mitigated? How are electrical signals processed? How are strong and tough materials designed and built? How is thermal energy managed? How is data transmitted? How are systems integrated? How do you make sure goods and services reach their destination? How do you start a company? What are the underlying ethical and social responsibilities of being a professional engineer? These are all things that engineers are dealing with on a daily basis and will form the basis of the first part of the course.   Introduction to Engineering Mathematics   Mathematics is an integral part of engineering and Engineering Mathematics is the process of applying the principles of mathematics to solve real life engineering problems.  A reference textbook will be used for this part of the course and is entitled “Introductory Mathematics for Engineering Applications” by Kuldip S. Rattan and Nathan W. Klingbeil. Publisher: John Wiley and Sons, ISBN:978-1-118-14180-9.   Topics to be covered in mathematics will include: application of algebra in engineering in linear and quadratic equations, trigonometry in motion of robots, application of complex numbers in electrical circuits, use of systems of equations to solve problems in statics, dynamics and DC circuits. Concepts of derivatives will be introduced and its application in engineering problems such as dynamics, electrical circuits and mechanics will be explored. In a similar fashion concepts of integrals will be examined in the context of engineering applications such as statics, dynamics and electrical circuits. The intent of this course is not to establish mastery of mathematics but rather develop an understanding of the role played by mathematics to help solve engineering problems. Participants in this course will have a better understanding of calculus and differential equations and their relevance in solving engineering problems as they progress in their engineering education.

Second, this course will review how China tried to project its world order into the relationship with Korea and Korea came to be integrated into the Chinese World Order from the 14th century to the 18th century (4 modules). More specifically, it will show how China intervened in the interstate trade and Korean music.  Finally, it will compare the two trajectories of political thoughts between Korea and Japan since 17th century. Korea fantasized itself as the genuine heir and center of the Chinese World Order, closing its door to foreigners. Meanwhile, Japan overcame the Chinese World Order and eventually converted itself as a modern state (1 module).

In postwar Tokyo, countless gazes fell upon others; gazes from and upon Americans and the Emperor, gazes going up skyscrapers or rushing aggressively through the cityscape, and gazes twining and wriggling among classes, genders, and ethnic groups in downtown Tokyo. In Part 2, we will focus on the geopolitics of these gazes in modern Tokyo. What kinds of gazes fell upon the war orphans, the poor, and the marginalized groups in Tokyo? How did students themselves, who represented the vast accumulation of knowledge in Tokyo, perform in front of these gazes? Moreover, how did cinema or television shows, as media for these gazes, implicate the whole city? In answering these questions, we will identify the geopolitics historically involved in the practice of “visualizing postwar Tokyo.”  </description><url>/enroll?course_id=34837</url></Course><Course><course_id>36376</course_id><title>Preparing for the AP* Statistics Exam</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Scott McDaniel, Jeff Moore, Ginger Rowell</instructor><school>School:  Tennessee Board of Regents</school><description>This course will introduce students to the major concepts and tools for collecting, analyzing and drawing conclusions from data.

As almost every building and every city is a prototype, these communities are in the early stage of development and require specific attention and expertise as we advance. Smart cities, such as Zurich and Boston, consist of human-made structures or environments that are, in some capacity, monitored, metered, networked and controlled. With this functionality, combined with stationary sensors and mobile devices, data and information have become the new building materials of future cities. Using this data, citizens are now beginning to influence the design of future cities and the re-design of existing ones. In this architecture course, you will learn the basics of information cities and urban science research, as well as how dynamic behavior and citizen-driven learning differentiate the responsive city from the smart city. The cities we present and develop in this course use the stocks and flows of information as the main drivers of change. To deepen your knowledge of smart cities and give a perspective on the future of these cities, we also introduce the concept of citizen design science, a combination of citizen science, urban design, and cognitive design computing. Participants will furthermore have unique access to a design research platform for citizen design science. The intelligent use of data and information is at the core of this course, and these concepts will be the next generation of participatory design and design computing environments. This course is part of the “Future Cities” XSeries, and builds on the experiences from our first two urban MOOCs: Future Cities and Livability in Future Cities.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=69237</url></Course><Course><course_id>69883</course_id><title>The Science and Politics of the GMO</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Sarah Evanega, Ronald Herring, David Just, Jaron Porciello, Rebecca Harrison</instructor><school>School:  Cornell University</school><description>What exactly are genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and why do scientists develop them? Studying the science of GMOs helps us understand biotechnology’s potential role in addressing challenges in agriculture. In this introductory Food and Nutrition course, you will learn the basics of genetic engineering, explore the political debate around the GMO and review the arguments for and against their use. We will study the politics surrounding the GMO and its impact at both an individual level and to society as a whole; including the problems, perceptions, benefits, and risks associated with GMOs. Important to understanding the complexities around this topic we will not only be looking at the science behind how the GMO works, but also to the limitations of this science. We will also discuss the importance of information literacy as a tool for effectively identifying and evaluating issues. Our goal is that this MOOC will impact people's understanding of science, what it can and can't do, and how information is transmitted. The intent is not to influence how people feel about GMOs, but to give them the critical thinking and scientific literacy tools necessary to make informed decisions — and to understand the broader impacts of those decisions.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=69883</url></Course><Course><course_id>69884</course_id><title>Real-Time Bluetooth Networks - Shape the World</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Jonathan Valvano, Ramesh Yerraballi</instructor><school>School:  The University of Texas at Austin</school><description>The increased demand by consumers and businesses for more utility, connectivity and smarter and more efficient electronic technology not only creates a need for more embedded systems but also for engineers in the embedded systems field. In this lab-based computer science course, explore the complexities of embedded systems and learn how to develop your own real-time operating system (RTOS) by building a personal fitness device with Bluetooth connectivity (BLE). An operating system (OS) is a software system that computers use to manage the resources of a computer. The OS decides which tasks are performed when and decides how resources are utilized. Simple embedded systems, which are a combination of electrical, mechanical, chemical, and computer components designed to perform a dedicated function, originally did not need an OS. However, as embedded systems have evolved, so have their complexities. To manage this, an RTOS is now required. Embedded systems are often deployed in safety-critical situations such as automotive, military, industrial, and medical applications. In applications such as communications and consumer electronics, response time and processing speed are important. A real-time system not only needs to arrive at the correct answer, but must also get the correct answer at the correct time. A RTOS manages a computer's resources so that tasks are performed in a timely mannner. In this computer science course, students will learn the design fundamentals of an RTOS from the bottom up and use these fundamentals to build practical real-time applications. We will provide a board support package (BSP), so students will be able to focus on the RTOS and Bluetooth network without needing prior experience in circuits and I/O device driver software. This is a hands-on project-based lab course, where you will incrementally build a personal fitness device with Bluetooth connectivity. This course is intended for students and professional engineers wishing to improve their skills in the fields of embedded systems, product development, computer architecture, operating systems, and Bluetooth networks. To complete this course, you will need to purchase a lab kit including a microcontroller board, an I/O board, and a Bluetooth module. Instructions about purchasing the kit and installing required software are at http://edx-org-utaustinx.s3.amazonaws.com/UT601x/RTOS.html .</description><url>/enroll?course_id=69884</url></Course><Course><course_id>65190</course_id><title>Introduction to Corporate Finance</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Ashok Thampy</instructor><school>School:  Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore</school><description>Business organizations are constantly engaged in financial decision-making related to financial planning, investments, capital purchases, etc. The right financial decisions play a critical role in maximizing an organization’s business value.

As a result, China influences the world with its outbound travel, trade, politics and culture. China is a society transforming itself through economic development where travelling and tourism play an important role. Tourism is a vital part of the global economy and the number of Chinese travelers to overseas destinations is growing rapidly. For example, 1.8 million Chinese tourists visited the US and spent a whopping $21.1 billion in 2014. That number could top $80 billion by 2021, according to some industry analysts. This course explores present and future development and trends in the tourism and hospitality business in China. It introduces the travel trends within and outside China from global perspectives. The political, economic, and social influence of tourism are examined from both hosts’ and guests’ point of view.  This bilingual and interactive course helps you understand China’s tourism sector from its importance on the global scale to its local impacts.

Economic outcomes are the result of our complex interactions with other people, businesses, the government, as well as with people and businesses globally. In this economics course, you will learn the basic stylized framework that economists use to think about, account for, measure and explain these complex interactions and outcomes. In the first half of the course, we consider how households decide how much to work and how to spend and save money. We will also look at how businesses make economic decisions such as how many workers to hire and how many machines and buildings to use to produce their products. In the second half of the course, we consider how different policies can potentially enhance or distort market outcomes by offsetting, alleviating, or amplifying these inefficiencies. Our focus will be on five aspects of economic policy: labor market policies and unemployment R-D and innovation policies fiscal policies and taxation monetary policy and inflation  free-trade policies This course satisfies the Social-Behavioral Sciences (SB) general studies requirement at Arizona State University.

However, to actually implement them across a real supply chain requires the use of technology across multiple systems. Supply chains have a long history of using technology to improve efficiency and effectiveness. The shear scale and scope of most supply chains require many distinct systems to interact with each other. Unfortunately, technology is a moving target. It is constantly evolving and improving so that today’s technology is outdated within a few years or months. Rather than focusing on a specific software system, this business and management course will focus on three aspects: fundamental concepts, core systems, and data analysis. We will start with the introduction of fundamental concepts that are used in all software tools. We will cover IT fundamentals, including project management and software processes, data modeling, UML, relational databases and SQL. We will also introduce Internet technologies, such as XML, web services, and service-oriented architectures. No prior programming experience required. We will then provide an overview of the main types of supply chain software including ERP, WMS, and TMS systems. We will describe their main functionality, how they work, how they are used, their architecture, data flows, and how they are organized into modules. We will also cover the software selection process and how software upgrade and implementation projects should be organized and managed. Finally, we will dive into data analysis that is core to all large supply chains. We will introduce visualization and big data analysis techniques that are used in practice today. This course is part of the MITx MicroMasters Credential in Supply Chain Management that is specifically designed to teach the critical skills needed to be successful in this exciting field.

Hamburger</instructor><school>School:  Harvard University</school><description>In Medieval Europe the Book of Hours, so called because its core component consists of the Hours of the Virgin, became the prayer book of choice for worshippers prosperous enough to commission or purchase such a book. Although its contents were of monastic origin, literate lay readers were the most likely to use books of hours, as served not only as a prayer book, but also as a way of keeping track of the calendar, often doubling as a family chronicle. Books of hours provide insight into broad patterns of piety marking the High and later Middle Ages, and through their choice of texts, images and added materials, inform us about the interior life and aspirations of everyone from kings and queens and lords and ladies to monks and nuns and, ordinary members of the patrician class, merchants and others. In this course, we will explore how books of hours provide the closest thing we have to a comprehensive and continuous record of the development of painting across most of western Europe from the later thirteenth through the early sixteenth century. “The Book of Hours” is one module of a series of courses called “The Book: Histories Across Time and Space.” You may take this course on its own, or with the other courses of the series.

What is the logical relationship among data? How is data stored in computers? What algorithms are required to solve particular problems? These are the questions that will be answered in “Data Structures and Algorithms,” an important core course in Computer Science. The course also introduces students to fundamental data structures and classical algorithms used in more specialized courses, including Operating Systems, Software Engineering, Database Systems, Compiler Principles, Computer Graphics and Human Computer Interaction. Niklaus Wirth described the important and indivisible link between algorithms and data structure in his book, Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs. The course will build on Wirth’s ideas as it helps students improve their knowledge of theory and their ability to think abstractly to solve problems. Building on a solid theoretical foundation, students will analyze problems using data and algorithm abstraction. Students will learn how to organize data efficiently and make tradeoffs between space and time complexity, design efficient and effective algorithms, and implement high quality programs to solve complex real-world problems. After studying this course, students will be well prepared for further study and research in engineering and other computer-related areas. This is an intermediate-level course appropriate for sophomore students majoring in computer science or other science/engineering disciplines. Students should have learned "introduction to computing", with the knowledge of structured and object-oriented programming. This course is presented in two eight-week sessions. Students who score 60% or higher will receive an Honor Code Certificate. The Autumn 2014 Sessions of this course are supported by Google. 课程采用的算法语言? Which programming languages does the course use? 本课程采用基于C++的伪代码授课和出习题。编程作业是POJ自动评判的，该平台目前接受 C、C++、Java等都可以。 The course’s content and exercises are both based upon C++ pseudo code.

Have you ever thought about the possibility of life elsewhere in the Universe? For the first time in human history, we know that planets around other stars not only exist, but are common! Alien Worlds focuses on the search and characterization of planets orbiting other stars (called extrasolar planets or “exoplanets”). Over the course of nine modules, we will learn some of the techniques used to discover the thousands of known exoplanets and will discuss how we can use basic scientific tools to characterize the sizes, masses, compositions, and atmospheres of exoplanets. We will also learn about the diversity of stars in the Galaxy to understand how stellar properties affect exoplanet detection techniques and influence planetary formation and habitability. In addition to the exploration of exoplanets, students in Alien Worlds will gain a basic understanding of light, gravity and motion, and be introduced to some of the most extreme life on planet Earth. We will hear from experts at the forefront of exoplanet science and interact with other participants and instructors through social media and online tools. Students will leave Alien Worlds with a better understanding of their place in the Universe and the skills to comprehend the wealth of new discoveries surrounding the countless worlds around distant stars.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=16427</url></Course><Course><course_id>27150</course_id><title>Business and its Environment: An Overview of Business and the Role of Finance in Business</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Brandi Ulrich, Kipp Snow</instructor><school>School:  Open Education Consortium</school><description>Introduction to the ways that business is related to, and interacts with, individuals, groups and institutions in the current U.S. environment.

Mechanics is the study of how things move. It was the first quantitative science to achieve wide power to predict behavior, including things never before directly observed. Newton, Leibniz, and others invented calculus to describe motion and we will find both differential and integral calculus extremely useful throughout this course. This is the second in a 3-part series of courses that parallels the second-semester mechanics course taught at Harvey Mudd College. Part 2 expands on Part 1 by considering the rotation of objects, connecting new concepts of angular momentum and torque to the properties of linear motion. Part 1 examined linear motion, and Part 3 examines wave motion. This course is an invitation to develop your problem-solving skills and to learn how to apply mathematics to all sorts of problems of the physical world. Learning the rules that govern how stuff moves in the world around us is exciting; using those rules to predict correctly something that you haven’t observed means that you really understand something. It‘s a great feeling. WHAT SHOULD I KNOW BEFORE WE START? You need not have taken physics before, but we assume that you have studied mathematics, up to and including a first course in calculus. You may be taking a calculus course concurrently with this course; that should be a good strategy. We will introduce important calculus ideas and methods as the need arises and provide examples. There is a Mathematics Diagnostic Test that you can take at the beginning of Part 1 of this series to ensure that your mathematics background will set you up for success in this course.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=41551</url></Course><Course><course_id>32029</course_id><title>Incarceration's Witnesses: American Prison Writing</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Doran Larson</instructor><school>School:  Hamilton College</school><description>The U.S. incarcerates a larger number and percentage of its own citizens than any nation on earth: larger than China, Russia, Cuba, or Iran.

This course looks inside U.S. prisons, through the history of literary witness produced by incarcerated people. This history will help us to understand the mass-scale prison’s rise, its day-to-day practices, and why it fails so badly at the task of rehabilitation. Through prison witness, we may hope to begin to understand what is needed to make the U.S. prison a more socially constructive institution. Among other texts, we will read and discuss Fourth City: Essays from the Prison in America, The (online) American Prison Writing Archive, hosted and made possible by Hamilton College's Digital Humanities Initiative, and come to a sense of the moral weight that prison witness must carry in any truly democratic debate on the criminal justice system.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=32029</url></Course><Course><course_id>45234</course_id><title>Southeast Asian Culture 东南亚文化</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Wu Jiewei, Shi Yang</instructor><school>School:  Peking University</school><description>东南亚在中国之南，且濒临海洋，所以古代把它称为“南海”或“南洋”。“东南亚”这个名称，是第二次世界大战期间才出现的。东南亚地区很早就有人类 活动，并在公元前后形成了原始的文化形态，主要表现在东南亚的岩画、巨石、瓮葬和铜鼓等特色鲜明文化遗迹。从公元3世纪开始，印度文化、中国文化、伊斯兰 文化和西方文化陆续进入东南亚地区，经历了长期的本土化过程，与东南亚的本土文化进行了充分的融合，形成了独特的文化形态和文化特点。 1967 年，印度尼西亚、泰国、新加坡、菲律宾四国外长和马来西亚副总理在曼谷举行会议，发表了《曼谷宣言》（《东南亚国家联盟成立宣言》），正式宣告东南亚国家 联盟（简称“东盟”）成立。20世纪80年代后，文莱（1984年）、越南（1995年）、老挝（1997年）、缅甸（1997年）和柬埔寨（1999 年）5国先后加入东盟，使这一组织涵盖整个东南亚地区。 由于中国与东南亚在地理位置上的相邻关系，奠定了东南亚地区在中国对外关系中的 “首要”地位。随着中国与东南亚交流层次的逐步深入，中国扩大了国际影响力，积累了丰富的开展国际交流的经验。但是，由于中国民众对于东南亚文化的了解程 度还有提升的空间，从而也在中国与东南亚的交流中造成了一定的问题。本课程将将系统梳理东南亚文化发展进程的基础上，以兼顾东南亚传统文化与现代文化的特 点，以具体的文化现象为中心，为同学们呈现东南亚文化的多样性与独特性。   "Southeast Asia" is the term which appeared during World War II. In Chinese history documents, this region was called “Nan Yang” or “Nan Hai”. From the beginning of the 3rd century AD, Indian culture, Chinese culture, Islamic culture and Western culture have moved into this area. After a long process of localization, external culture and the native culture were fully fused, forming a unique cultural expression and cultural characteristics. In 1967, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines and Malaysia issued "Bangkok Declaration" to declare the establishment of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was established. After the 1980s, Brunei (1984), Vietnam (1995), Laos (1997), Myanmar (1997) and Cambodia (1999) has joined the ASEAN, so that this organization covering the entire Southeast Asian region. As the geographical neighbor of China, the Southeast Asian region plays "top" role in China's foreign relations. With the gradual deepening of exchanges between China and Southeast Asia, misunderstanding of cultures caused some problems. In order to improve the understanding of Chinese people about the neighbor countries, this course will show the development steps of Southeast Asian culture, and explain the traditional and modern culture features of Southeast Asia through the specific cultural phenomenons. 教学参考书有哪些? 吴虚领：《东南亚美术 》，中国人民大学出版社，2004年。 贺圣达：《东南亚文化发展史》，云南人民出版社，2010年。 （新西兰）尼古拉斯•塔林《剑桥东南亚史》，王士录等译，云南人民出版社，2012年。 梁志明等：《东南亚古代史》，北京大学出版社，2013年 授课形式是什么样的？ 本课程主要包括由讲课视频、参考教材阅读、作业、在线讨论、期末考试组成。每周的讲课视频有3-5段不等，每一段的时长在10分钟左右。每一周有一次课后作业。 教学团队鼓励修读者互帮互助，主动解答线上提出的问题。 本课程的评分方法？  本课程的成绩评定主要由以下4个部分组成： 单元测验（占总成绩20%） 每单元都有一次测验，包括10道客观选择题。同学们需要在课程结束1周内完成测验。 单元作业（占总成绩20%） 每单元都有一个讨论题作为书面作业。同学们需要在课程结束1周内容完成。 互评作业（占总成绩20%） 每单元都有一个互评作业，每个同学需要评价至少5份作业。同学们需要在课程结束2周内容完成。 期末考试（占总成绩40%） 由40道客观选择题组成。考试时间2小时。 Reading Materials Wu Xuling, Art of Southeast, Remin University Press, 2004.

Stark</instructor><school>School:  Berkeley</school><description>Statistics 2 at Berkeley is an introductory class taken by about 1000 students each year. Stat2.2x is the second of three five-week courses that make up Stat2x, the online equivalent of Berkeley's Stat 2. The focus of Stat2.2x is on probability theory: exactly what is a random sample, and how does randomness work? If you buy 10 lottery tickets instead of 1, does your chance of winning go up by a factor of 10? What is the law of averages? How can polls make accurate predictions based on data from small fractions of the population? What should you expect to happen "just by chance"? These are some of the questions we will address in the course. We will start with exact calculations of chances when the experiments are small enough that exact calculations are feasible and interesting. Then we will step back from all the details and try to identify features of large random samples that will help us approximate probabilities that are hard to compute exactly. We will study sums and averages of large random samples, discuss the factors that affect their accuracy, and use the normal approximation for their probability distributions. Be warned: by the end of Stat2.2x you will not want to gamble. Ever. (Unless you're really good at counting cards, in which case you could try blackjack, but perhaps after taking all these edX courses you'll find other ways of earning money.) The fundamental approach of the series was provided in the description of Stat2.1x and appears here again: There will be no mindless memorization of formulas and methods. Throughout the course, the emphasis will be on understanding the reasoning behind the calculations, the assumptions under which they are valid, and the correct interpretation of results. FAQ What is the format of the class? Instruction will be consist of brief lectures and exercises to check comprehension. Grades (Pass or Not Pass) will be decided based on a combination of scores on short assignments, quizzes, and a final exam. How much does it cost to take the course? Nothing! The course is free. Will the text of the lectures be available? Yes. All of our lectures will have transcripts synced to the videos. Do I need to watch the lectures live? No. You can watch the lectures at your leisure. Will certificates be awarded? Yes. Online learners who achieve a passing grade in a course can earn a certificate of achievement. These certificates will indicate you have successfully completed the course, but will not include a specific grade. Certificates will be issued by edX under the name of BerkeleyX, designating the institution from which the course originated. Can I contact the Instructor or Teaching Assistants? Yes, but not directly. The discussion forums are the appropriate venue for questions about the course. The instructors will monitor the discussion forums and try to respond to the most important questions; in many cases response from other students and peers will be adequate and faster. Do I need any other materials to take the course? If you have any questions about edX generally, please see the edX FAQ.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=14131</url></Course><Course><course_id>28811</course_id><title>Applications of Linear Algebra Part 2</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Tim Chartier, Allison Dulin, Robert McSwain, Kristen Eshleman, Sara Swanson</instructor><school>School:  Davidson College</school><description>Our world is in a data deluge with ever increasing sizes of datasets. Linear algebra is a tool to manage and analyze such data. This course is part 2 of a 2-part course, with this part extending smoothly from the first. Note, however, that part 1, is not a prerequisite for part 2. In this part of the course, we'll develop the linear algebra more fully than part 1. This class has a focus on data mining with some applications of computer graphics. We'll discuss, in further depth than part 1, sports ranking and ways to rate teams from thousands of games. We’ll apply the methods to March Madness. We'll also learn methods behind web search, utilized by such companies as Google.  We'll also learn to cluster data to find similar groups and also how to compress images to lower the amount of storage used to store them. The tools that we learn can be applied to applications of your interest.  For instance, clustering data to find similar movies can be applied to find similar songs or friends.

Then we focus on the two main measurement technologies: next generation sequencing and microarrays. We then move on to describing how raw data and experimental information are imported into R and how we use Bioconductor classes to organize these data, whether generated locally, or harvested from public repositories or institutional archives. Genomic features are generally identified using intervals in genomic coordinates, and highly efficient algorithms for computing with genomic intervals will be examined in detail. Statistical methods for testing gene-centric or pathway-centric hypotheses with genome-scale data are found in packages such as limma, some of these techniques will be illustrated in lectures and labs. Given the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you. If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology lectures. Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty relatively quickly across the first three courses. By the third course will be teaching advanced statistical concepts such as hierarchical models and by the fourth advanced software engineering skills, such as parallel computing and reproducible research concepts. The courses in this series will be released sequentially each month and are self-paced: PH525.1x: Statistics and R for the Life Sciences PH525.2x: Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra PH525.3x: Statistical Inference and Modeling for High-throughput Experiments PH525.4x: High-Dimensional Data Analysis PH525.5x: Introduction to Bioconductor: annotation and analysis of genomes and genomic assays  PH525.6x: High-performance computing for reproducible genomics PH525.7x: Case studies in functional genomics This class was supported in part by NIH grant R25GM114818.

But the process of focusing light into image on the back of the eye and translating it into meaningful nerve signals is incredibly complex. The retina and visual cortex are packed with intricate processing circuitry, and have been a mystery to neuroscientists for centuries. Now, answers are beginning to emerge.   Today, the visual system is often called the model system for neuroscience: its findings are relevant to all other areas and to investigating the deeper mysteries of the brain’s microstructure and function. In this course, we take you from the physics of focusing light onto the retina, to the processing of colors, form, and motion, and finally to the interpretation of visual information in the cortex. We distill the mysteries of the visual system by posing questions and investigating them in a series of thematic, animated videos. This journey through the eye, retina and brain will (quite literally) change how you see the world.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=26687</url></Course><Course><course_id>69529</course_id><title>Introduction to Engineering</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>3.0</rating><review_count>2</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Pranesh B.

Desde que en 1954 se realizara el primer trasplante exitoso de un órgano, la cirugía de trasplantes se ha desarrollado espectacularmente brindando esperanza y calidad de vida a muchos enfermos. Mientras esas técnicas y posibilidades terapéuticas avanzan, persisten sin embargo muchos interrogantes sobre el modo en el que los órganos pueden obtenerse lícitamente. Algunos de esos dilemas nos acompañan desde siempre, otros son suscitados por la aparición de fenómenos novedosos como el turismo de trasplantes, las posibilidades que ofrece la donación tras la muerte cardiocirculatoria o los descubrimientos sobre las funciones fisiológicas remanentes en los pacientes diagnosticados en muerte cerebral. En la inmensa mayoría de los países no se pueden comprar y vender órganos. ¿Por qué? A pesar de que muchas personas siguen muriendo a la espera de recibir un órgano, en ningún país se confiscan los órganos de las personas fallecidas. ¿Por qué? ¿Pueden donar los menores? ¿Debemos prescindir de la conocida como “regla del donante cadáver” y permitir la eutanasia para la donación? ¿Con qué límites? ¿De qué manera influye la potencial condición de donante de un órgano en los cuidados que se proporcionan al final de la vida? ¿Cómo evitar el conflicto de intereses entre quienes velan por la vida de los futuros receptores de un órgano y quienes aún se afanan por cuidar a quien va a fallecer de manera irremisible e inminente? En este curso nos adentraremos en el análisis de ésas y otras cuestiones, pero también introduciremos los nuevos desafíos que para la ética y el Derecho plantean trasplantes novedosos así como la discusión en torno a los criterios de justa distribución de los órganos   The first successful organ transplantation was performed in 1954. Since then, the technique has evolved tremendously, giving hope and increased quality of life to many patients around the world. While the technology and drugs advance, several controversies persist regarding the way in which organs may be obtained. Some of these dilemmas arose on the very first day in which organs’ transplantation originated; others have emerged as a result of new phenomena such as transplantation tourism, the new possibilities brought by donation after cardio-circulatory death, or increasing knowledge about the remaining physiological functions detected in patients pronounced as brain dead. Almost all countries in the world forbid the selling of organs. Why? Although many people die while on the waiting lists, in no country does the Government confiscate cadaveric organs. Why? May minors be organ donors? Should we abandon the so-called “dead donor rule” and allow “organ-donation euthanasia”? How does the potential condition of becoming a donor influence the administration of end-of-life care? How should we avoid the eventual conflict of interests between those who care for the life of future recipients of organs and those who are in charge of the dying patient-eventual-donor? In this course we will explore the answers to these questions, and we will also engage in the assessment of the more recent challenges posed by novel transplantation techniques, and, albeit briefly, in the discussion regarding the fair distribution of organs. </description><url>/enroll?course_id=36414</url></Course><Course><course_id>45183</course_id><title>Death 101: Shaping the Future of Global Health</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>2.0</rating><review_count>1</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Prabhat Jha</instructor><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><description>This global health and life sciences course enables learners to investigate health problems affecting large populations – the whole world in fact!

At least 10,000 different proteins make you what you are and keep you that way. In this biology course you will learn how proteins drive almost all living processes. Proteins manufactured by cells perform a broad range of essential functions—the molecular workforce of living organisms. You will learn how proteins are the cellular manifestation of genetic information. They are assembled into a polymeric structure from monomers derived in part from components in our diet. Proteins catalyze metabolic reactions, replicate DNA, respond to stimuli, provide movement, and much more. Using video lectures, articles, case studies, and molecular models, we will explore how proteins are constructed, how they fold into 3-dimensional shapes, the kinds of bonds that hold these folded structures together, and the immense range of roles that proteins assume from structural proteins found in muscle to catalysts for cellular chemical reactions. Purification and characterization are essential to understand protein structure and function, and we will identify a variety of methods to uncover how these tiny machines drive almost all living processes.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=36386</url></Course><Course><course_id>34509</course_id><title>Anthropology of Current World Issues</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>4.0</rating><review_count>14</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Gerhard Hoffstaedter, David Trigger, Anna Cristina Pertierra, Annie Ross, Sally Babidge, Kim de Rijke</instructor><school>School:  University of Queensland</school><description>This course will allow you to better understand the world around you through utilising the anthropological lens.

Quality has become a critical driver for long-term success through continuous process improvement and customer satisfaction. Quality Management today concerns the entire value chain, encompassing multi-tiered supplier networks and customer service and returns. This business and management course balances the quantitative elements of quality engineering with a managerial approach to using quality in an organization to effect change. We cover the statistical basics needed for a Six-Sigma Green Belt certification, following the well-known process-improvement cycle: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control. The most important quality methods and techniques are taught, including sampling, statistical process control, process capability, regression analysis, and design of experiments. Quality management is examined, from the viewpoint of quality incorporated into product design, measuring and controlling quality in production and improving quality, using interactive, guided projects and case studies. The course closes with the presentation of a full Six-Sigma project. The contents of this course are essentially the same as those of the corresponding TUM class (Quality Engineering and Management) and will enable you to immediately understand and apply quality concepts in your work and research. WHY TAKE THIS COURSE? Quality issues appear everywhere and affect the entire organisation. You'll quickly master quality concepts so that you can apply quality tools and drive quality programs within your own organisation. You'll gain the fundamentals for a Six-Sigma Green Belt in a manageable and positive learning environment, along with the chance to discuss with staff and fellow learners worldwide.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=45226</url></Course><Course><course_id>67548</course_id><title>Pre-University Calculus</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>13</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Bart van den Dries, Roelof Koekoek, Wolter Groenevelt, Fokko van de Bult</instructor><school>School:  Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)</school><description>Mathematics is the language of Science, Engineering and Technology.

It explores vernacular architecture as an expression of local identity, indigenous traditions, and assimilation of different cultures. This course covers topics such as native building materials, the interaction between people, culture and the vernacular, as well as the vernacular landscape. It has a special emphasis on the built heritage of Asia, which allows students to take a closer look at examples in diverse locales, such as the leather yurts in Mongolia, timber houses in Japan, brick, mud and straw houses in India, reinforced concrete fortified towers and grey brick courtyard houses in Southern China including Macau and Hong Kong. Designed to promote discussion and dialogue while contributing to the discourse surrounding the concept of the vernacular, this course challenges the perception of tradition and stimulates a deeper analysis of one’s local environment. Indeed, we are keen to hear about how you link your new understanding to vernacular architecture in your neighborhood. Those who wish to extend their experience and exploration please also join our subsequent 5-week course The Search for Vernacular Architecture of Asia, Part 2 in Summer 2015.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=36405</url></Course><Course><course_id>45231</course_id><title>The Rise of Superheroes and Their Impact On Pop Culture</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>11</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Stan Lee, Michael Uslan, David Uslan, Christopher Robichaud</instructor><school>School:  The Smithsonian Institution</school><description>Join the Smithsonian, and comic book industry legend Stan Lee, to explore the history of the comic book and the rise of superheroes. The ancient gods of Egyptian, Greek and Roman myths still exist, but today, they have superpowers, human foibles and secret identities. They come from comic books and graphic novels, and have taken over pop culture on the stage, screen, video games, and animation.   From Superman® and Spider-Man®, to The Avengers® and The Hulk® and beyond, who are these heroes? And, how have they evolved from folklore and myth, across all cultures and religions?   Learn from Smithsonian and industry experts including: Stan Lee, who was one of the creators of the modern superhero template. His early comics featuring Spider-Man, Iron Man®, The Hulk, Thor®, and The Avengers led Marvel to success. He continues to reinvent himself to create modern global superheroes and appear in cameos in superhero films and TV, such as Avengers: Age of Ultron. Michael Uslan, executive producer of top grossing, award winning movies, including The Dark Knight series, Lego® Movie, the animated Batman films and Batman® VS Superman.  In this course, we explore the following questions: Why did superheroes first arise in 1938 and experience what we refer to as their “Golden Age” during World War II? Why did the superhero genre ebb and flow in popularity over the decades? How have comic books, published weekly since the mid-1930’s, mirrored a changing American society, reflecting our mores, slang, fads, biases and prejudices?  Why was the comic book industry nearly shut down in the McCarthy Era of the 1950’s?  How did our superheroes become super-villains in the eyes of the government, clergy, educators, and parents of the mid-20th Century?  When and how did comic books become acceptable again, and eventually become valid teaching tools in universities and schools?  When and how did comic book artwork become accepted as a true American art form as indigenous to this country as jazz?  Finally, when and how did comic books become “cool” and the basis for blockbuster movies, hit TV series, top-selling video games, and acclaimed animation, while also impacting fashion and style- and even the moral and ethical codes of children- around the globe? For the first time ever, the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History is excited to offer the opportunity to go into the collection and see why superheroes are a dominant cultural force in today’s world. As you learn about how cultural myths, world events, and personal experiences shaped the first superheroes, you will apply these frameworks to create your own superhero– or you can choose to do a deeper analysis on existing comic book heroes.  This original project is required for certification and anything created by you as part of the course is the intellectual property of you and you alone. At last, fans, students and seekers of knowledge have the opportunity to enroll in the ultimate comic book course.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=45231</url></Course><Course><course_id>49848</course_id><title>Human Origins</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>11</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Donald C.

Parametric signal modeling and the efficient implementation of DT multirate and sampling rate conversion systems are discussed and developed. An in-depth development of the DFT and its computation as well as its use for spectral analysis and for filtering is presented. This component of the course includes a careful and insightful development of the relationship between the time-dependent Fourier transform and the use of filter banks for both spectral analysis and signal coding. 6.341x is organized around eleven units each typically consisting of a set of two to four topics. The source material for learning each topic includes suggested reading in the course text, clarifying notes, other related reading, and video excerpts and will include an interactive on-line discussion forum. The course text is the widely used text by Oppenheim and Schafer (third edition), available on the course website in viewable format. The video segments are adapted from live video recordings of the MIT residential course.  Each topic includes a set of automatically-graded exercises for self-assessment and to help in digesting and understanding the basics of the topic, and in some cases to preview topics. A typical unit in the course concludes with a set of more extensive problems to help in integrating the topics and developing a deeper understanding. Automatic grading of your answers to these problems as well as solutions will be provided.   FAQ Who can register for this course? Unfortunately, learners from Iran, Sudan, Cuba and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time. While edX has received a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to offer courses to learners from Iran and Sudan our license does not cover this course. Separately, EdX has applied for a license to offer courses to learners in the Crimea region of Ukraine, but we are awaiting a determination from OFAC on that application. We are deeply sorry the U.S. government has determined that we have to block these learners, and we are working diligently to rectify this situation as soon as possible. Cite this course as Alan V.

This means that the flow speed is more than five times the speed of sound. In air at room temperature, the speed of sound is around 340 m/s, so a Mach 5 flow would have a flow speed of 1.7 km/s or just over 6,000 km/h. When a rocket launches a satellite into earth orbit, when a probe enters the atmosphere of another planet or when an aircraft is propelled by a supersonic combustion ramjet engine (a scramjet), hypersonic flows are encountered. Hypersonics – from Shock Waves to Scramjets introduces the basic concepts associated with flight at speeds greater than Mach 5 and takes students to the stage where they can analyse the performance of a scramjet engine that might be used in a future access-to-space system.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=35931</url></Course><Course><course_id>51488</course_id><title>English at Work in Asia: Preparing for a Job Interview</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>5.0</rating><review_count>11</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Jessica Xia, Bee Dy</instructor><school>School:  The Hong Kong Polytechnic University</school><description>This two-part job search course guides you on the path to career success.

Ignorance is relevant to every discipline and profession, and to everyday life, both at work and at play. No matter what domain you study or work in, this course will have something to offer to you. We will explore questions about ignorance such as: Where does ignorance come from? How do we impose ignorance on each other, and even on ourselves? And why? We usually think about ignorance as a bad thing, but can it be preferable not to know something? How do we use ignorance? What roles does ignorance play in social interaction, group relations, institutions, and law? Can ignorance sometimes be a virtue?  When can ignorance be good or bad for us? How can we harness the unknown for learning, discovery, and creativity?  Your understanding of ignorance will be expanded via online games, discussion forums, opportunities to find out what your own “ignorance profile” is, additional readings, and Wiki materials. There also will be discussion threads specifically for those of you who want to apply understandings about ignorance to complex social and environmental problems. Knowing more about ignorance will help you to manage and work with it. It also will help you in dealing with the unexpected, and with complex problems.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=45344</url></Course><Course><course_id>45488</course_id><title>Medicating for Mental Health: Judicious Use of Psychiatric Drugs</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>3.0</rating><review_count>3</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  F.

This course prepares you to be an effective collaborator with your physician, psychiatrist, or psychologist when deciding if a medication is appropriate treatment. The course introduces fundamental principles for the use of drugs as therapy. It encourages students to have realistic goals regarding the strengths and limitations of psychiatric medications. It provides basic understanding of how a drug acts upon the brain to improve behavioral symptoms. You will learn how new drugs are developed to become viable options for treatment, and how they are ultimately approved for being prescribed. Additionally, this course provides perspective on the proper use of psychiatric medication as a part of a multifactor treatment program. Altogether, you will acquire a working knowledge to gain confidence that a psychiatric medication is being used wisely to give the best advantage for a successful improvement of symptoms while minimizing risk of side effects.  </description><url>/enroll?course_id=45488</url></Course><Course><course_id>34587</course_id><title>Dynamics and Control</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>3.0</rating><review_count>3</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Pedro Albertos</instructor><school>School:  Universitat Politècnica de Valencia</school><description>This is an interactive course about the basic concepts of Systems, Control and their impact in all the human activities. First, the basic concepts of systems, dynamics, structure and control are introduced. Then, looking at many examples in Nature and human made devices, we will realize that the dynamic behavior of most systems can be modified by adding a control system. Later we will see how knowing how to evaluate the dynamic behavior of a system and measure its performance will provide the tools to design new controlled systems fulfilling some requirements. By considering which are the benefits of control and the challenges for the future we will open the mind to tackle new applications and develop new scenarios from the micro-systems level to the common systems and the whole universe. An overview of the techniques available for a deeper introduction to the subject will be presented at the end. Control technology is said to be a hidden technology. We do not notice it under normal operation, but it appears if a failure happens. Looking around in Nature and at human made devices, we realize that their behavior presents analogies and that we can manipulate their temporal evolution. Characterizing the dynamic behavior of systems and the possibility to change it by introducing control devices is the main aim of the course. You will learn to analyze the dynamic properties of a system and the options to change its behavior according to some requirements.You will learn the basic concepts to undertake further studies in control engineering and its use in a variety of disciplines, from human and social sciences to any engineering field. </description><url>/enroll?course_id=34587</url></Course><Course><course_id>45204</course_id><title>Introducción a la Ingeniería del Helicóptero</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>3.0</rating><review_count>3</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Miguel A.

The ecosystem of banks and financial markets (including Central Banks) has deepened in size, sophistication and complexity over the years. However, in recent times they have also been the subject of abuse, failures and economic distress in several countries resulting in a ‘contagion’ that has concurrently affected several countries around the world! More recently, and perhaps more importantly, thanks to the liberalization of most economies, the world has witnessed an exponential increase in the free flow of capital across countries. Banking institutions and financial markets, being the predominant conduit for such free flow of capital across countries, have therefore become even more "globally interconnected." Such a globally interconnected financial system, combined with regulatory systems that are country-specific and hence varying considerably in rigor and implementation, has further compounded the risks and the consequent contagion, as witnessed in the global financial meltdown that was triggered in 2008. Introduction to Banking and Financial Markets - I helped learners understand the theory and concepts underlying banking and financial markets, the products and instruments offered and the underlying market mechanisms. Part II of this economics and finance course will discuss: The complex ecosystem of banking and financial market in a global context The appending risks in that ecosystem How these risks and potential adverse outcomes are addressed and redressed using several risk mitigation techniques and sound regulatory oversight</description><url>/enroll?course_id=69233</url></Course><Course><course_id>69859</course_id><title>Smart Grids: Electricity for the Future</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Mani Vadari, Mrudhula Balasubramanyan</instructor><school>School:  IEEE</school><description>Ever wondered why you hear the term “smart grid” so often these days, and what it’s all about?

Love sports or hate them, their cultural role or influence cannot easily be dismissed. In this course, we will explore some of the fundamental ethical issues raised by sport, ranging from investigation of the nature of sports to see what values, if any, sports do and should promote and the educational significance of sports especially in higher education in the U.S, violence in sports, gender equity in sports, and the ethics of using performance enhancing drugs. We hope that through brief lectures on videos, hearty debate in the discussion board, interactive media, and some selected readings to promote not only better understanding of the ethics of sport, but also appreciation for the role of reasoned discourse in advancing our understanding of ethical issues and how to approach them.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=69941</url></Course><Course><course_id>69248</course_id><title>Paradigms of Computer Programming – Abstraction and Concurrency</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Peter Van Roy</instructor><school>School:  Université catholique de Louvain</school><description>Louv1.2x and its predecessor Louv1.1x together give an introduction to all major programming concepts, techniques, and paradigms in a unified framework. We cover the three main programming paradigms: functional, object-oriented, and declarative dataflow. The two courses are targeted toward people with a basic knowledge of programming. It will be most useful to beginning programming students, but the unconventional approach should be insightful even to seasoned professionals. Louv1.1x (Fundamentals) covers functional programming, its techniques and its data structures. You’ll use simple formal semantics for all concepts, and see those concepts illustrated with practical code that runs on the accompanying open-source platform, the Mozart Programming System. Louv1.2x (Abstraction and Concurrency) covers data abstraction, state, and concurrency. You’ll learn the four ways to do data abstraction and discuss the trade-offs between objects and abstract data types. You’ll be exposed to deterministic dataflow, the most useful paradigm for concurrent programming, and learn how it avoids race conditions. To learn more about the practical organization of the two courses, watch the introductory video. </description><url>/enroll?course_id=69248</url></Course><Course><course_id>69235</course_id><title>Introduction to UX Design</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Mark W.

Both courses provide a solid foundation in the area of reliable distributed computing, including the main concepts, results, models and algorithms in the field. Today's global IT infrastructures are distributed systems; from the Internet to the data-centers of cloud computing that fuel the current revolution of global IT services. At the core of these services you find distributed algorithms. These algorithms run on multiple computers and communicate only by sending and receiving messages. It is crucial for the implemented services to continue to work 24/7 even if some of the computers fail or some of the messages are lost in transit. This is the subject of reliable distributed algorithms in computer science. ID2203.1x covers models of distributed algorithms based on input/output automata; specifications of fault tolerant abstractions and failure detectors; specific distributed abstractions and fault-tolerant algorithms, including reliable broadcast and causal broadcast; key-value stores and consistency models; single-value consensus and the Paxos algorithm. To complete the course with a full grade (100%) students are required to answer the graded quizzes provided every week, as well as the programming assignments.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=69874</url></Course><Course><course_id>66271</course_id><title>Social Work Practice: Advocating Social Justice and Change</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Mary Ruffolo, Barbara Hiltz , Katie Richards-Schuster</instructor><school>School:  The University of Michigan</school><description>In this social science course, you will learn how social workers in the United States engage in creating change and supporting the resilience of individuals, families and communities in this new era.

Nous allons aborder tout d'abord les propriétés physiques des fluides : les états de la matière et la notion de viscosité. Un chapitre sera dédié à la tension de surface et à la capillarité. Nous introduirons ensuite le concept de similitude et l’utilisation des nombres adimensionnels. Nous allons alors considérer la statique des fluides à travers la loi de l'hydrostatique. La dynamique des fluides sera abordée en premier lieu par la cinématique. Ensuite, nous traiterons des équations de bilan avec notamment une application du théorème de conservation de l’énergie cinétique : le théorème de Bernoulli. Dans le dernier, nous montrerons que ce théorème relativement simple permet d’expliquer et de calculer des écoulements tels que ceux observés dans les rivières. Les vidéos du cours seront enrichies de vidéos d’expériences qui illustreront les concepts clés et par des quiz pour tester votre intuition et vos connaissances.

Peterson</instructor><school>School:  Harvard University</school><description>This mini-course looks in-depth at modern-day issues surrounding teacher policies in U.S. education. The teacher is the most important person in our schools. How do we recruit and retain the very best teachers? What are our current methods for recruiting teachers? How well do we compensate them?  What are the effects of adjusting teacher salaries to be based on their performance in the classroom? When should teachers be given tenure? Do current policies encourage or discourage effective teachers from entering the profession? Many questions come down to budgetary constraints. Should you hire more teachers so you have smaller classes? Should it be a priority to balance how much is spent between wealthy and poor districts? Throughout this mini-course, we will be focused on using empirical evidence to answer these questions. This mini-course contains six lectures, with most lectures divided into three videos. The mini-courses also include assigned readings, discussion forums, and assessments. This is the second mini-course in a four-course sequence.

Then we focus on the two main measurement technologies: next generation sequencing and microarrays. We then move on to describing how raw data and experimental information are imported into R and how we use Bioconductor classes to organize these data, whether generated locally, or harvested from public repositories or institutional archives. Genomic features are generally identified using intervals in genomic coordinates, and highly efficient algorithms for computing with genomic intervals will be examined in detail. Statistical methods for testing gene-centric or pathway-centric hypotheses with genome-scale data are found in packages such as limma, some of these techniques will be illustrated in lectures and labs. Given the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you. If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology lectures. Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty relatively quickly across the first three courses.

We start with RNA-seq data analysis covering basic concepts of RNA-seq and a first look at FASTQ files. We will also go over quality control of FASTQ files; aligning RNA-seq reads; visualizing alignments and move on to analyzing RNA-seq at the gene-level: counting reads in genes; Exploratory Data Analysis and variance stabilization for counts; count-based differential expression; normalization and batch effects. Finally, we cover RNA-seq at the transcript-level: inferring expression of transcripts (i.e. alternative isoforms); differential exon usage. We will learn the basic steps in analyzing DNA methylation data, including reading the raw data, normalization, and finding regions of differential methylation across multiple samples.

Geneticists, archaeologists, anthropologists and behavioral scientists offer a variety of often opposing ideas about how dogs—the first domesticated species—arose. Some place the origin of dogs over 100,000 years ago; others place the start of dogs just 12,000 years ago. Claims for the location of the origin of dogs range from China to Europe and many places in between. Diverse scholars have suggested dogs arose as trash scavengers or as hunters’ helpers. This course will provide you with the tools you need to find your own way through the confusing claims about the origin of dogs. This course is part of the Dog Behavior and Cognition XSeries.  No previous knowledge of any of the sciences contributing to the origins of dogs is assumed. Form your own assessment of the mysterious origins of “man’s best friend.” This course is approved for CEUs by the following organizations: Certification Council for Professional Dog Trainers (CCPDT) Students who pass will receive a certificate for a total of 7 CEUs for behavior consultants. Additional CEUs are available by taking the remaining two courses in the series: Dog Perception and Cognition (7.5 CEUs) and Dog Behavior: Problems and Solutions (6 CEUs).

From modest beginnings 2,000 years ago, it has grown to encompass nearly a third of the human population. Diverse in languages, cultures, histories and creeds, Christians nonetheless share a common collection of sacred scripture called the Bible. This religion course introduces you to the Bible and its scripture and asks the questions: What are the contents, languages, and forms of Bibles in various times and places? How have Christians lived out their stories and teachings? How does Christian history reflect the contested and varied uses of scripture—in the ancient Roman world where Christianity began, in its spread through European and American colonialism, in the diverse forms it takes in varied locations around the globe? You will begin to explore these questions and others while learning about the content and interpretations of these sacred texts. No previous knowledge of Christianity or the Bible required.

But what is CSR? What does it mean, and what does it involve? Do stakeholders really care, and if they do, how should companies communicate with them? In uncertain modern climates, CSR is a crucial driving force of a (r)evolution in business. If you are interested in the relationship between business and society, this course is for you! It is especially relevant for industry, public policy, and academic professionals working on CSR, as well as students following a traditional business curriculum who are interested in key value questions. The content is also accessible for consumers who are curious about how to make informed decisions while pursuing their own well-defined, long-term, responsible consumption goals. This course addresses CSR in two ways: As a reflection of corporate self-awareness As a source of innovation and a means to deal with heightened competitiveness, demands for sustainable development, and shifts in international governance By presenting insights from CSR experts, from both academia and practice, this course provides a way for managers, consumers, and citizens to acquire in-depth insights and critical perspectives on companies’ CSR activities and communications. The multi-industry case study structure of this course enables participants to confront the challenges facing today’s managers as they seek to develop and communicate their own CSR initiatives. Dedicated discussion forums also are available for participants to present personalized CSR cases. To help participants manage and communicate about CSR with various internal and external stakeholders, this course seeks to:   Support current and future business leaders in their efforts to make responsible leadership, sustainable production, and consumption central to their corporate vision.   Help citizens to function more effectively as informed watchdogs and responsible consumers. </description><url>/enroll?course_id=69214</url></Course><Course><course_id>69269</course_id><title>Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Rafael Irizarry, Michael Love</instructor><school>School:  Harvard University</school><description>Matrix Algebra underlies many of the current tools for experimental design and the analysis of high-dimensional data. In this introductory data analysis course, we will use matrix algebra to represent the linear models that commonly used to model differences between experimental units. We perform statistical inference on these differences. Throughout the course we will use the R programming language. Given the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you. If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology lectures. Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty relatively quickly across the first three courses. By the third course will be teaching advanced statistical concepts such as hierarchical models and by the fourth advanced software engineering skills, such as parallel computing and reproducible research concepts. These courses make up 2 XSeries and are self-paced: PH525.1x: Statistics and R for the Life Sciences PH525.2x: Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra PH525.3x: Statistical Inference and Modeling for High-throughput Experiments PH525.4x: High-Dimensional Data Analysis PH525.5x: Introduction to Bioconductor: annotation and analysis of genomes and genomic assays  PH525.6x: High-performance computing for reproducible genomics PH525.7x: Case studies in functional genomics This class was supported in part by NIH grant R25GM114818.

Most organizations require lots of storage because users and applications are constantly working with and creating data. As a Microsoft Windows Server System Administrator you must be able to:   Identify and decide on the type of storage your organization needs Manage disks, volumes, and file systems Use BitLocker to secure volumes Encrypt data with Encrypted File System (EFS) Furthermore, optimizing Microsoft Windows Server storage is key to keeping pace with your organization’s ever increasing data needs. Once you have initially configured your Microsoft Windows Server storage you will want to take advantage of three key features: iSCSI Storage, Storage Spaces and Data Deduplication. iSCSI is a protocol that supports remote access to SCSI-based storage devices over a TCP/IP network. It provides and easy to use alternative to Storage Area Networks (SANs) and can use existing infrastructure. Storage Spaces lets you group physical disks together and present them as a single logical disk. This makes it easy to manage and dynamically allocate storage. Data Deduplication is a service that identifies and removes duplications within data. The goal of Data Deduplication is to maximize the use of disk space. Go beyond simple storage strategies and take control of your organization’s storage needs! This self-paced interactive computer science course is the second in a series of courses where you’ll have the opportunity to learn the fundamentals of Windows Server 2012 operating system administrative tasks.

Both courses provide a solid foundation in the area of reliable distributed computing, including the main concepts, results, models and algorithms in the field. In order to ensure that IT infrastructures - a key engine of operations for any organization - operate at full capacity and efficiency, it is vital to understand its core: distributed algorithms. To achieve this, the infrastructure itself must be reliable and resilient. This course continues on the foundations of distributed algorithms, introduced in ID2203.1x, and builds on these concepts at a higher level of complexity to develop the skills needed to build and maintain reliable and efficient distributed systems. ID2203.2x covers specific advanced abstractions and algorithms including sequence consensus and multi-Paxos; atomic broadcast and replicated state machines. It also covers dynamic reconfiguration of services; the use of physical clocks in distributed systems; the CAP theorem, and weaker consistency models, including eventual consistency and conflict-free replicated data-types. Students will experiment and develop a variety of distributed algorithms in an interactive, engaging programming environment using the Scala programming language. They will be guided throughout the programming assignments and provided with intuitive examples to help them get started. To complete the course with a full grade (100%) students are required to answer the graded quizzes provided every week, as well as the programming assignments.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=69890</url></Course><Course><course_id>67565</course_id><title>Explorer l’espace des humains: une introduction à la géographicité</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  Jacques Lévy, Boris Beaude, Hélène Noizet, Patrick Poncet</instructor><school>School:  École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</school><description>Comment définir et comprendre la notion d’espace?

El modelo de la sociedad industrial está dejando paso a un nuevo modelo de sociedad, aún difuso, en el que la capacidad de transformar la información en conocimiento es clave. Es fácil deducir que para esta nueva sociedad emergente se necesita un concepto de educación bien distinto al que requería la sociedad industrial. Sin este cambio educativo difícilmente se podrá conseguir satisfactoriamente el cambio y, consecuentemente, instalarse adecuadamente en un mundo que va a alterarse radicalmente. El curso tiene dos objetivos. El primero es presentar el fenómeno de la transformación de la sociedad que estamos viviendo y los fundamentos para definir el mundo que está emergiendo como el de la sociedad del conocimiento.  La pretensión de la primera parte es disponer de un escenario suficientemente detallado y sólido de lo que está sucediendo y superar así la visión e interpretación triviales que pueda haber sobre un nuevo modelo de sociedad. Sin esta buena base es difícil fundamentar el siguiente objetivo del curso: el papel de la educación. El objetivo de tratar la educación en este curso es para presentarla en estrecha relación con una intensa crisis cultural que inevitablemente tiene que sobrevenir para que no aumente el desajuste entre el mundo tecnológico -planetario, desigual y contradictorio- que hemos levantado y los valores culturales de otros tiempos con los que queremos mirar e interpretar el mundo de hoy y el que se avecina. Así que se tratará la estrecha relación que hay y debe haber entre educación y cultura. De igual modo se verá en el curso la relación entre tecnología y educación, no desde el punto de vista instrumental, sino cultural. La pretensión del curso es que de esta observación del fenómeno actual de  cambio, y de la interpretación del papel de la educación para la orientación y control de ese cambio, surjan elementos inspiradores de acciones educativas precisas ajustadas a las múltiples realidades concretas desde las que se están sintiendo los desafíos de vivir en el siglo XXI. El planteamiento didáctico del curso seguirá la estructura de un viaje por el tiempo, por lugares y también por conceptos que haga ameno el recorrido durante las siete semanas. En cuanto a la parte textual, habrá la experiencia de lectura de piezas multimedia concebidas y escritas para la lectura en pantalla, y especialmente en smartphones y tabletas.

The objective of this course is to: develop and improve non-science students' scientific literacy so that students have some basic knowledge of chemistry, chemists thinking, problem solving understanding, expand their horizons and knowledge, understanding today Several major challenges facing human society association between the chemical and, thereby contribute to students' own career development. The main content of the chemical and the basic concepts of society, including chemical, organic chemistry, polymer chemistry, materials chemistry, environmental chemistry, geochemistry, energy, chemistry, biochemistry, food chemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry and household chemistry. At the beginning of the course, will briefly introduce some basic concepts and knowledge of chemistry, followed by some important branches of chemistry, and they are widely used in social life. Chemical originated in ancient mysticism. East and West Taoist alchemists in pursuit of immortality and endless wealth in the process laid the foundation for chemistry experiments, to develop a more systematic method and apparatus for chemical experiments. Although saver warlocks do not realize their initial goal, but they made one more great achievement, it is a chemical used as a science was born. Chemistry with theoretical and experimental basis for the broad application areas, after three hundred years of development, has become a pillar disciplines of human civilization. Recalling the history of human development, almost iconic during the progress of each civilization are closely related to the contribution of chemists. Metal fabrication technology, artificial ammonia technology, synthetic rubber and plastics and nano materials are first hand from the chemist, and therefore no exaggeration to say that the chemical is a cornerstone of human civilization. The purpose of this course is not the culture and society of chemical chemist, but describes the chemical and its achievements, describing the discipline's past, present and future. Therefore, this course is like a "tourist spaceship", with students overlook this magical area, along a taste of the chemical in the most representative area. Through the study of chemistry and society, students can not only learn some basic knowledge of chemistry, the relationship can be the history and status quo of chemistry, chemical and society, current and future prospects of some hot issues in the field of chemistry and the chemical has a contour Formula understanding.

Mechanics is the study of how things move. It was the first quantitative science to achieve wide power to predict behavior, including things never before directly observed. Newton, Leibniz, and others invented calculus to describe motion and we will find both differential and integral calculus extremely useful throughout this course. This is the first in a 3-part series of courses that parallels the second-semester mechanics course taught at Harvey Mudd College. Part 1 explores the concepts of momentum, force, and energy, and how these properties define the motion of objects at everyday speeds. Part 2 examines angular motion, and Part 3 examines wave motion.  This course is an invitation to develop your problem-solving skills and to learn how to apply mathematics to all sorts of problems of the physical world. Learning the rules that govern how stuff moves in the world around us is exciting; using those rules to predict correctly something that you haven’t observed means that you really understand something. It‘s a great feeling. WHAT SHOULD I KNOW BEFORE WE START? You need not have taken physics before, but we assume that you have studied mathematics, up to and including a first course in calculus. You may be taking a calculus course concurrently with this course; that should be a good strategy. We will introduce important calculus ideas and methods as the need arises and provide examples. There is a Mathematics Diagnostic Test that you can take at the beginning of this course to ensure that your mathematics background will set you up for success in this course.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=41168</url></Course><Course><course_id>36117</course_id><title>人群与网络 | Networks and Crowds</title><provider>edX</provider><rating>0</rating><review_count>0</review_count><instructor>Instructors:  李晓明 （Li Xiaoming）, 邱泽奇 （Qiu Zeqi）, 王卫红（Wang Weihong）</instructor><school>School:  Peking University</school><description>课程介绍视频可以访问这里。 点击上方绿色按钮报名。 以 社会学与经济学若干经典问题为载体，以计算机科学的典型思维方法为工具，学习与体会两类学科知识的交叉与互动。涉及的话题包括社会网络、关系平衡、匹配市 场、中介市场、拍卖市场、信息级联、网络效应、流行性、新事物的传播、小世界现象、表决制度等。本课程的学习目标，一是加深我们对某些生活现象的理解，二 是初步掌握一套分析研究那些现象与问题的思路与方法。 这是一门入门性质的课程，适合计算机类专业，社会学、经济学等社会科学专业的低年级本科生；同时也可供其他背景和程度的人们开阔视野。 课程的内容主要基于教材《网络、群体与市场》（译），同时在互联网上也有公开免费的英文版本 本课程采用哪本教材？ Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning about a Highly Connected World  (Free Online) "networks, groups and Markets: Principles and effector mechanisms reveal the behavior of highly interconnected world" (translation), Tsinghua University Press, 2011.</description><url>/enroll?course_id=36117</url></Course></ROOT>
