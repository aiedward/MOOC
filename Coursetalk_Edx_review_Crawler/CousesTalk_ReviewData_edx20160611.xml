I had previously benefited from a private tutor as well as several college level courses but the progress was slow. In regular class settings there were often 15 to 20 students which means that the teachers only could progress as the majority of students progressed. Also the textbooks used in various courses were often focused on school related topics rather than practical everyday conversations. This course from Tsinghua University took a different approach from anything I had experienced before. Foremost it integrated from the beginning a focus on proper pronunciation, relevant vocabulary, reading, recognizing and writing of Chinese characters. The team delivering this course and the resources that went into preparing this course were enormous. All videos were of excellent quality. Even the free online textbook was of great help. The most important benefit of this course was in my opinion the discussion forum where each week of the course lots of people posted questions or shared resources. It is thru those exchanges I became aware of some fabulous tools to accelerate learning of Chinese. Last but not least, when the course was completed students could continue their study of Mandarin by participating in the Tsinghua Chinese Group, a FaceBook page open to all who are interested to learn to speak with 1.3 billion people. Thank you to all the staff involved in preparing this course and best wishes to all for continuing to develop followup courses.This amazing course has truly accelerated my learning of Mandarin.

The structure, the professors and the professionalism with which this course has been made is impressive. The course takes you on a journey at the same time as you are learning together with the main character Peter. And Peter has a small journey that he takes in his dreams. This is definitely a journey worth taking - even if you just want to learn for fun. But I am certain that if you are going to use it in your daily life then this will a great foundation on which to build the rest of your chinese learning upon. I have enjoyed every course session and you learn how to speak using pinyin, you learn the chinese characters, even how to pronounce correctly (which is definitely the hardest part).

The content focuses on useful practical sentences that you could use straight away with chinese friends or during a trip to China. The videos are very short and each focuses on a special topic with loads of nice vocabulary! Each time, you get the pinyin pronunciation with a visualization of the tones like a music scale (and the chinese characters is in the workbook so that the content stays focus on pronouncing the words in a first place!). And in addition to that you even get videos about calligraphy, which will teach you stroke by stroke how to write basic words! The teachers make the videos really enjoyable, and the fact that there is a storyline keeps the lessons linked to real situations. I'm sincerely thankful to all the persons who contributed to the making of this course, and would recommend it to anyone willing to start learning mandarin!This class was truly amazing to start learning mandarin!

I wish I had started learning Chinese this way! The course integrates simple practical sentences with clear explanations. It puts ample emphasis on good pronunciation as well as teaches from the beginners level onwards how to write essential characters. Nicely presented by a staff who is highly responsive to questions and suggestions made by participants. They should be encouraged to move on and deliver more intermediate and advanced levels for learning Mandarin.Excellent course. I wish I had started learning Chinese this way!

I had previously benefited from a private tutor as well as several college level courses but the progress was slow. In regular class settings there were often 15 to 20 students which means that the teachers only could progress as the majority of students progressed. Also the textbooks used in various courses were often focused on school related topics rather than practical everyday conversations. This course from Tsinghua University took a different approach from anything I had experienced before. Foremost it integrated from the beginning a focus on proper pronunciation, relevant vocabulary, reading, recognizing and writing of Chinese characters. The team delivering this course and the resources that went into preparing this course were enormous. All videos were of excellent quality. Even the free online textbook was of great help. The most important benefit of this course was in my opinion the discussion forum where each week of the course lots of people posted questions or shared resources. It is thru those exchanges I became aware of some fabulous tools to accelerate learning of Chinese. Last but not least, when the course was completed students could continue their study of Mandarin by participating in the Tsinghua Chinese Group, a FaceBook page open to all who are interested to learn to speak with 1.3 billion people. Thank you to all the staff involved in preparing this course and best wishes to all for continuing to develop followup courses.This amazing course has truly accelerated my learning of Mandarin.

This course combines historic data with deep analysis that lays foundation of learning for future. Through real events that happened in Japan, South Korea, Soviet Union, Singapore, Turkey, Chile, India and South Africa we can truly see how cultural, historical, social - institutional factors can determine extra-ordinary growth - same factors can turn out to be real challenges to deal with. Content - pace of lectures was perfect for me. I now sees things in India - the world very differently - now know enough factors that are important for today - future. I wish for more such courses from IIMB. Thank You Professor Vachani sir - course coordinators - whole team of The Course.Thank You Prof. Vachani sir for this wonderful course.

In here you will learn not only about the books that the clergy used for the Mass or for when they had to travel; but you will also learn about the day office and night office (the Matin) and the books that they had to use in the Office (which was visited around 8 times a day!) to be able to read, sing and pray during the many hours of the day. This course will also teach you a basic plant of a church and about the calendar and the proper of the time, the proper of the saints and the common saint and what they all have in common regarding the books. While I don't know a bit at all about music I was able to understand the explanations of the chapter of Musical Notation and the impact of course that made the improvement created by Guido of Arezzo. Had the pleasure of learning about all these books and what they are and happy to have gain more information for future references in my works.

Quizzes contain a lot of insightful, though not always easy tasks. This MOOC covers a wide range of topics, and still it barely scratches the surface of space missions engineering. Yet the course team is not to be blamed for that. It's simply impossible to put the whole world into one course. Yet I hope, the continuation will follow because each unit deserves its own course. I also liked how quizzes are organized. In unobtrusive step by step guidance you can understand how things work, and what earlier seemed to be a magic becomes a solid science, which does not frighten, but captivates.This is a great course.

If you're looking for an introductory course, this isn't one. But if you're looking for a thorough astronautical, aeronautical and astrophysical technical course, you're in the right place. A strong mathematics and physics background is advised, and the workload may seem too difficult at times, since there's a lot of calculation going on in quizzes and tests. The amazing thing is that the professor gives you his first-hand experience as an astronaut, and the course also covers the most recent space project, being one of the few courses that are so much up-to-date. I'd thoroughly recommend it, but be prepare for lots of hard work.A lot of hard work has been invested in this course. If you're looking for an introductory course, this isn't one.

I am still not convinced that an online course needs to feel as if you are sitting in classroom while the professor teaches and writes on the board. But I do believe that L. J. Gibson and her energetic and active way of teaching encourages you to learn and get the most from her classes.

This is an awesome introduction to linear motion. The material is presented in lecture style videos and accompanied by videos related to homework type problems. The material is presented clearly and precisely with little need to refer to the free online text or other outside sources. Homework is slightly challenging but definitely reinforces the concepts presented in the videos. The unit labs present an opportunity to take measurements, make adjustments, apply recently learned material and solve problems in an interactive online environment. The course is geared toward high school students or as an introductory college level course. Professor Hafnor and his “accomplices” really try to make physics fun. They seem interested in the material and their students. They were accessible and didn’t feel like they were thousands of miles (kilometers) away. Overall I would give this course an “A”. If they fix a few inconsistencies, microseconds vs. milliseconds and a few glitches and add one more stupid physics trick, this course would absolutely receive an “A+”.

After having completed parts 1 and 2, no question that I would also do this third part. Within not even 3 months I've learnt Italian, so that I'm now able to read many, partially difficult texts concerning different topics. The course contains plenty of rather useful videos presenting interviews with Italians of origin who talk about politics and Italian culture, arts, music etc. You can get really a good idea of how Italians live, how do they think, which are the current problems economically, socially, learn about the history of Italy and more, diversified and interesting clips and, what's most important as being integrated in a language course, they are well understandable as they present different facets of pronunciation. You can follow the content which matches the grammatical problems of each lession and see how they are implemented into the spoken language. All exercises are diversified as well, so that it is not a boaring task, on the contrary it makes fun and you can engross the thoughts very effectively. Each lession starts with an optimal grammar explanation and then is followed by several clips in which all grammatical problems are introduced, step by step, in a very clearly structured way, as if you are sitting in a classroom and listening to the teacher. Don't ask me how many times I've listened to them, only to internalize the Italian voice, pronunciation, syntax, to get the feeling for the grammar by listening to all useful examples. Last but not least, the support, i. e. the communication in case of questions, either according to language or technical problems is really remarkable! I've got some experiences in learning online foreign languages, but none of the till now finished ones made me feel so far the author's sensitivity while having prepared the course material for those details which learners really must get aware of. For me this one is not only an excellent course but the very best I've ever done! It should serve as an example for effective teaching of other languages. This course must be recommended! Thank you for that, Mrs. Bartalesi-Graf and your team!This is part 3 of an excellent course teaching Italian. After having completed parts 1 and 2, no question that I would also do this third part.

Ambos doctores/profesores, Aznar y Guijarro, son espectaculares. Explican de una forma muy entendible y profesional todo el contenido del curso. Gracias a este curso, ya sé utilizar el método AHP y este será fundamental para la toma de decisiones dentro de mi organización. Lo mejor es aprender sobre un método tan importante cuando este es aplicado a un deporte tan bello como el fútbol. Sí eres fanático del deporte más hermoso del mundo, y encima eres un profesional en cualquier area o industria, disfrutarás este curso al máximo. Así como lo hice yo.

Especially loves the quizzes that allows us to key in any expressions and even sketch graphs, and the grading can be done automatically! (I guess should have some AI involved). The content and quiz questions were very challenging. As an instructor of this topic at my institution, I still need to spend 4-6 hours per week going through the materials.

It assumes some knowledge of linear algebra and statistics including regression. Unlike most MOOCs, which are at the freshman/sophomore level, it's taught at an end-of-undergraduate or beginning graduate level. The lectures of 1st rate, with plenty of concrete examples as well as a bit of the theory and equations. The problem sets of challenging enough so that one really learns the material better through doing them, as opposed to the Johns Hopkins Data Science series, whose material is excellent, but whose problem sets are too easy. Ideally, this course could be studied while reviewing your linear algebra text, and further reading such as "The Elements of Statistical Learning" by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman. My only complaint about this course is that there is not a lot of activity on the Discussion boards. This has been particularly problematic for me, as I am running about 3 weeks behind the lead group of students.This course, and in fact this series, is taught at a rigorous enough level to be greatly helpful for analyzing data in a research setting.

This course will be very helpfull for my research.</review><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>65219</course_id><course_title>Sustainable Soil Management: Soil for life</course_title><school>School:  Wageningen University</school><review_data_id>120734</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Cary Clark</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-04-28</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>I am hoping the course will touch upon the shifting paradigm of tillage farming to no-till farming that seems to be spreading as a one of the options of climate smart agriculture for its benefits of soil health, ecosystems service provision and saving biodiversity below and above the ground.I am hoping the course will touch upon the shifting paradigm of tillage farming to no-till farming that seems to be spreading as a one of the options of climate smart agriculture for its benefits of soil health, ecosystems service provision and saving biodiversity below and above the ground.</review><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>65219</course_id><course_title>Sustainable Soil Management: Soil for life</course_title><school>School:  Wageningen University</school><review_data_id>120721</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Sara Panis</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-04-28</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Additional information by the course staff: Module 1 is about soil formation, functions and threats. It will be the introduction to the MOOC, introducing you to why soils are so important and the major issues/threats related to soil. After this module you’ll be able to name key soil functions and the roles that soils play as well as some of the leading soil degradation issues around the world. You will learn how soils are formed and about some key soil characteristics. This is the first obligatory module to be able to earn a certificate. During this module you’ll identify soil functions in a landscape, and learn how to determine the basic texture and structure of soil in your own environment. You’ll also be able to practice retrieving soil data from the ISRIC SoilGrids. Module 2 is about soil water processes. It will explain the importance of soil water processes for soil functions and services. It will teach you about fundamental soil water processes and factors involved. We will show you the causes, consequences, and concerns of reduced soil wettability, compaction and soil sealing, and the potential for avoiding and correcting them. This is an obligatory module to be able to earn a certificate. During this module you’ll put theory into practice by at home demonstrations to see the key topics, and by looking for evidence of the key topics in your own surroundings. Module 3 is about the dynamics of soil fertility and importance of soil organic matter. This module will teach you what determines soil fertility, which nutrients are needed for the growth of plants, and summarize the processes that cause a loss of soil fertility and the effects of that. It will show you what nutrient surpluses and nutrient deficits are. You will learn about the role of soil organic matter in nutrient dynamics, soil water holding capacity and climate change mitigation, as well as the threats to soil organic matter. This module will give you examples of environmental consequences and how to reduce phosphorus losses from agricultural soils. This is an obligatory module to be able to earn a certificate. During this module you’ll start your own pot experiment and observe the effect of soil nutrients on plant growth. Module 4 is about loss of soil biodiversity. We will show you the main groups of soil organisms and how they interact. This module will explain the relation between soil biodiversity and soil functions, and summarize the processes that cause a loss of soil biodiversity and their effects. You will also hear about measures and strategies to prevent and resolve the loss of soil biodiversity. This is an obligatory module to be able to earn a certificate. In this module you’ll get into the field and discover the rich life under our feet by executing simple tests. Module 5 is about water erosion. This module will explain the processes involved in water erosion, the causes of water erosion and its effects on soil functions. We will share with you the measures and strategies to prevent and resolve water erosion. This is an elective module, you need to elect at least two to be able to earn a certificate. During this module you’ll investigate the types and causes of water erosion present in your environment. Module 6 is about wind erosion. It will explain the processes involved in wind erosion, the causes of wind erosion and its effects on soil functions. We will share with you the measures and strategies to prevent and resolve wind erosion. This is an elective module, you need to elect at least two to be able to earn a certificate. During this module you’ll build your own mini wind tunnel to put theory into practice and test how erodible different types of soil are and the effectiveness of some counter measures. Module 7 is about soil pollution. In this module we’ll make a distinction between point pollution and diffuse pollution. We will explain the main sources of soil pollution, how different pollutants behave in the soil and why it’s important to know about the natural background levels of heavy metals in soils. This module will share with you how soil properties affect pollutants, and also explain the concept and importance of bioavailability of heavy metals in soil. Finally this module will introduce you to dose-response relationships and how they can be used. In the end we provide an overview of some soil remediation techniques and explain the concept of phytoremediation. This module is an elective module, you need to elect at least two to be able to earn a certificate. During this module you’ll be asked to visit your local farm store to discover what chemicals are used in your environment. Module 8 is about soil salinization. We’ll explain the process of salinization, the causes of salinization and the effects on soil functions. This module will show you the value of the Leaching Requirement equation for managing soil salinization. Finally we will share with you measures and strategies to prevent and resolve salinization. This module is an elective module, you need to elect at least two to be able to earn a certificate. During this module you’ll follow the experiment of Dr. Ritzema and discover the influence of salt on soils and plants. Module 9 is about achieving sustainable soil management. We will introduce you to the factors that influence farmers’ decisions about farming practices. This module will teach you how to execute a cost benefit analysis (CBA) and a multi criteria analysis (MCA). We will discuss how to achieve sustainable soil management at farm and landscape level, and also the role scenario analysis and the concept of scaling-up. Finally this module will cover the role of public policies in sustainable soil management. This is an obligatory module to be able to earn a certificate. In this module you’ll play the African Highland Farmer Game and learn how challenging it can be to sustainably manage your plot of land. You’ll also discover sustainable land management in your own country. Module 10 contains the final exam and concludes this MOOC. While studying the previous modules you have learned a lot about the issues, processes and societal challenges underlying soil health, soil degradation and sustainable soil management. One of the main goals of this course was to introduce you to information and tools that will motivate you to contribute to ensuring sustainable soil management for the future. You’ll be asked to synthetize the information acquired in the MOOC in a case study and present a plan of action that inspires the target audience. You’ll critically evaluate the contributions of peers and give constructive feedback. The main topic is soil degradation in your environment and how to effectively reduce and reverse that through more sustainable soil management.Additional information by the course staff: Module 1 is about soil formation, functions and threats.

So anyone expecting a deep treatment of this area will be disappointed. That said, the course is a very thorough, and quite approachable introduction to "Big Data", one particularly suited to those with a limited technical background, but wanting a broad understanding of the concepts and technologies used in the field. For example, all the fundamental concepts are presented, and straightforwardly explained, right from data science basics, to distributed databases, the mapreduce programming model, and the various frameworks in common use based on these ideas. The quizzes are not onerous, but do require that close attention be paid to the course material, and focus on testing conceptual understanding, rather than requiring any problem solving. All in all, a very competent introductory course, well suited to a minimally-technical audience wanting a broad understanding of this field.Although the course is called "Big Data for Smart Cities", little course time (in fact, only one section in Module 4) is devoted to the application of big data to the smart city application domain.

The course's videos are very easy to digest and make tough concepts like distributed systems, data nodes and task scheduling much more manageable. The readings are also very enriching and to-the-point. The quizzes are not trivial, but manageable because one needs to understand the lectures and readings to do the quizzes. However, this course really lacks practical assignments or exercises. For instance, the assignments can provide more than knowledge checking by having some toy examples or exercises. I highly recommend this course for someone who looks to understand the concepts of Big Data from a conceptual point of view. However, you should not expect to learn technical skills and applications of Big Data in this course. That said, if future iterations of this course introduces some programming or code-writing assignments, it'll be extremely awesome because the structure of the course has been very well-designed so far.The course serves as a great survey of the Big Data landscape.

The instructors make us aware that environmental issues is currently a hot topic but it has many challenges along the way. The best we can do is be more sustainable in our choices at home at work and whatever political philosophy we uphold. I like doing the course and found it rather challenging although i began by thinking i would immediately ace the course. I have learnt a lot and it will help me in the future by being more aware of my surroundings and the choices i make when i go to the market etc. Thank you very much for making a Mooc otherwise to get this information is very hard. I like education being at ones finger tips where one can learn at ones own pace in the convienience of ones own home. Whether I pass or fail is irrelevant as I know the info i recieved will help me as i have downloaded the lectures and have a print out of it and refer to it at any time. It will help me in my daily life. I realised that a lot of magazines and websites I get emails from talk about sustainable development and India is on a digital path. I feel happy to be part of the future too.I think the course content is very informative and friendly.

It's incredibly frustrating to do the assignments, unable to correctly answer after you exhausted all your attempts, and they decided not to share the correct answer. So you have no clue what the correct solution is.

While someone with Linux/UNIX/Networking experience could pass the exam with little preparation. I found it to be informative and a good course for the beginner. Having read all the material I learned a lot of things I did not know. The first few lessons were more historical and promotional than education but once you get into the Linux Structure and Installation section you start to learn about the real thing. For the beginner some links to supplementary information on installing dual boot or virtual machines would be helpful. Other than that the course material is a good introduction to Linux that anyone can learn from. While the course material could be more detailed or challenging in some places you have to remember this is an 8 week introductory course and as that it covers a lot of ground. Good value for the $99.00 I spent.I have completed this course and accept it for what it is, an introductory course.

After looking at the course topics, I decided to just give the final exam a go to see how much I knew. Despite hardly ever using Linux in my life and not currently having it installed on any of my computers, I scored a 93% (28/30) on the final exam. The final exam took me approximately 5 minutes (no exaggeration). Just having a reasonable amount of knowledge about computers in general will allow you to easily pass this course. There is really no substance to this course, and it seems to just be a marketing ploy for the Linux Foundation to possibly promote their paid courses and certifications. I have nothing against the Linux Foundation, and I was genuinely just looking to improve my very limited knowledge of Linux. This is not the place to do so. Do not waste your time with this course, and do NOT under any circumstances pay money for this piece of crap.I enrolled in this free course last night and watched a few of the videos from the first lesson.

There are about 60 minutes of high-quality video lectures each week, followed by a quiz and programming exercises. The programming exercises are in MATLAB through a web interface, usually adding some missing functionality to a program. The MATLAB web interface is much improved compared with parts 1 and 2 of this course, though understanding the complete program is still sometimes frustrating. The final week is an exam which took me about 90 minutes to complete. High-school maths is enough to complete this part of the course and I think you could do this part of the course without first completing parts 1 and 2.Interesting insight into how computer networks really work, although I already knew about 25% of the material from using a computer for many years.

Quizzes wouldn't work, due dates would be wrong, homework wouldn't show up on the progress page. I and so many other students reported the problems, and in the month that this course ran, they never got fixed. An instructor logged in about half-way through the course to mark some of the problems as having been fixed. But they hadn't been! And she never showed back up. The discussion board in the course is filled with complaints about what a poor job was done by edX and with fury about the unresponsiveness of the course staff. I think that these book clubs are a great idea. I think that this novel was great, and the questions that were asked about the novel were sensible. Some of the people I encountered in the discussions offered insightful comments and content. So, this model, to me, could provide a valuable experience. But edX needs to exert a little oversight on the courses so that they aren't of such low quality and so that obvious, easily fixable problems are addressed. I would be embarrassed if I were the instructor--Maggie Sokolik--or Berkeley or edX and was putting my name on this produce. I can't believe that they are willing to take money for this.In all honesty, this was a terrible course because the staff was totally unresponsive to the multiple problems that students experienced the whole way through.

It's allowing me to read some of my dusty covers. I really want to applaud the creator of this course for the vocabulary and background element that has adds to the intensity of the reading experience that otherwise would have been linear. It has been truly a learning experience for me. From the book discussed, "The Room with a View", we had to learn words from different soils; as well as, deep research into the Edwardian era's politics, customs, economics, trends, and religions to name a few. I found it interesting in learning that the women's shoe had neither left or right before this era, or that corsets were wore as honorable to ones family, or that Audubon Society began due to the mass-amounts of birds being killed that adorn women all around the globe. Go figure. It not only aids my learning in this read, but several books yet been explored. I do agree with the above reviews concerning homework deadlines and grammatical correctness requirements, but I try to keep in mind that this is a book club...the best I have been a part of in my life. Thank you EdX and Berkeley University for given me this great gift.The course is wonderful for a book junkie like me. It's allowing me to read some of my dusty covers.

I found it interesting in learning that the women's shoe had neither left or right before this era, or that corsets were wore as honorable to ones family, or that Audubon Society began due to the mass-amounts of birds being killed that adorn women all around the globe. Go figure. It not only aids my learning in this read, but several books yet been explored. I do agree with the above reviews concerning homework deadlines and grammatical correctness requirements, but I try to keep in mind that this is a book club...the best I have been a part of in my life. Thank you EdX and Berkeley University for given me this great gift.</review><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>42214</course_id><course_title>"A Room with a View" by Forster: BerkeleyX Book Club</course_title><school>School:  Berkeley</school><review_data_id>118589</review_data_id><reviewer_name>student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-02-17</review_date><review_value>1</review_value><review>I'm halfway through, but this course has been a mess. The content would possibly be ok, but the course has been plagued by technical and organizational problems. Specifically, though all course materials say that homework and quizzes are due on Wednesdays, and though the first week's work was due on Wednesday, somebody set the later due dates in the system to Mondays. So, for two weeks running, a large number of students did their homework and readings but couldn't turn in their homework. This seems like a simple mistake with a simple fix. But several days after the problems began to appear, no problems have been fixed, and EDX and course administrators have not even contacted students back on their concerns/complaints. The message board is filled with people complaining about the poor quality and unresponsiveness of the course administrators. From my perspective, these book clubs are a good idea, but half-way through, this one has been carried out out very poorly.I'm halfway through, but this course has been a mess.

I would recommend this course for anyone wanting to study an introduction to business accounting for whatever reason. I found the five-week format and pace of the course just right. Each weekly topic builds nicely on the previous topic. My main tip is to make the effort to the finish the graded assessments each week (before the start of the next topic). A second tip is that if you find something difficult to grasp, take a break and then repeat the tutorial. Note that week’s 3 to 5 need much more study time than week 1 and 2. A third tip would be to consider investing in the textbook written by the course presenter Professor R. Narayanaswamy. I live and work in the UK, and I find this textbook easier to read and understand; it has more pages of examples and explanations than introductory UK textbooks that I have seen on Amazon UK. I sincerely thank the all staff at IIM Bangalore for making this most valuable course possible.I really enjoyed the course and I am glad that I completed the course.

First of all it's not a typical app development course concentrated on coding. This course will attempt to teach you how to find and polish an idea for an app by conducting research in a field of interest you have chosen. (Part 1) In short your first task after selecting your field of interest will be to study what and how people actually proceed to achieve their goals. You can do it by simply observing them and their environment, giving them tasks or conducting interviews. The next step is to summarize the research results and identify ideas for your app. You'll be required to write a short academic style paper for it. (Part 2) Once you have the idea(s), you can start designing your app by creating models (service blueprint, use cases and many more). You will also design flows between different screens of your app. At the end of part 2 you will be required to conduct a usability analysis with a paper prototype, or in plain English you will ask people to accomplish some tasks with your paper app. There is a paper to submit here as well. (Part 3) Finally, you'll be coding your application, recording a short video and designing a poster about it. As stated in the description of the course, you'll need to be able to code it by yourself. And now for some pros and cons. The course is interesting, well structured, videos are self explanatory and assignments are... demanding. It's good. As for cons, at least for me, the quiz questions accompanying many video-lectures are a bit imprecise and thus difficult to answer. Good thing is their influence on final score is minimal. The most important drawback (again, in my eyes) is that examples provided for assignments are not good enough. That is – those examples probably wouldn't get the highest possible score from course designers. I understand the idea is to push participants to be creative (or test their reading comprehension of assignment requirements), nevertheless I pref to learn from good examples. In conclusion: if you're interested in ways of deriving an idea from user experience, testing it and actually building (coding) it, then the course might suit your needs.My comment is related to parts one, two and three as they are intertwined together.

The syllabus looks promising and, as stated, edX courses are always high quality and never a disappointment.

It has helped me to re-think about the way I teach, which is good because I was running out of ideas when trying to improve my training sessions. I’ve learnt a lot about EdTech, pros and cons, example of success and failures. I’ve reinforced the idea of the many benefits it provides, but the most important thing I’ve learnt is that although the technology can be great it may not be necessarily good for the goal I’m pursuing. I’ve renewed my passion for teaching and learning as well as my interest in research for better practices. Reading other people experiences, learning for professionals and sharing ideas has refreshed my brain. The MOOC itself is very well structured; videos are great, easy to follow and engaging, with real situation well explained, key concepts developed and to the point. All supporting materials were very interesting as well. I would definitely recommend this course and look forward to learn more in the near future. Thanks MITx team!

The course videos, readings as well as peer discussions definitely helped shape my thinking on specific aspects related to evaluation to create a more thought out plan. Clear, concise and thought provoking guidance by Professor Eric Klopfer in the course videos and hangouts with a nicely structured program has been organized very well by Elizabeth Huttner-Loan.

This was probably the worst I've tried so far (and I've done quite a few already here and on other platforms too). The video quality is bad and the entire course is poorly organised. On week 2 they've restructured the course and they discarded all the scores and our progress from week 1. Then on week 4 they've introduced an additional week so our scores dropped again which means that our progress was shown incorrectly throughout the entire course. The forums are poorly managed too. We are asked to answer questions in the discussion forum (which is great in theory) but in practice we ended up with hundreds of threads in the exact same topic - needless to say I stopped following the discussions. Judging by some of the frustrated comments, you have to be very lucky to get response from a teaching staff. There is inconsistency in the scoring (in addition to discarding the points) and in the number of submissions available (2 submissions for a True of False question - where is the value in this???? --&gt; And then they've corrected it for week 5).

However we are talking about 12+ lecturers per week, with multiple questions after (almost) each one of those lecturers which are due in a week. I found that to be unrealistic for someone with my schedule, and this is the first edx course I had a problem concerning a time-frame. Plus I found it hard to follow the first instructor. I think that she should have rehearsed before each recording, and more effort should have been invested in the subtitles. It is a shame because I was really looking to do the entire series of courses, but unless the deadline for homework is laxed I don't see that happening unless I take some time off.I was excited to take on this course, but I had to drop it because I would simply not be able to complete it.

I don't really learn very well from lectures. Call it personal preference. Call it years of Engineering, but simply watching video lectures, video lectures that are not that interactive with examples, are not conducive to absorbing and retaining material. The same goes for reading sample literature. The best way to learn, in my opinion, is by practicing concepts, and there was very little opportunity to apply what was learned. I think this was the attempt of the applied lectures each week, but spending several hours actually working problems would be a more efficient way to drive home concepts. The homework in the course was too easy, and the R examples were simply copying and pasting, rather than letting somebody try to develop skills in R. Yes, they could do it on their own, but they could do it on their own without taking this course. From a practical standpoint, a lot of charts presented in the lectures were unreadable. From a schedule standpoint, starting the class at a time when people are on vacation or visiting families seemed unnecessary. I still have the Bayesian week remaining, so maybe the course will improve. I will still continue on with the track, because I am interested in Machine Learning. Hopefully it will improve.I was pretty disappointed with the class for a variety of reasons. I don't really learn very well from lectures. Call it personal preference.

Although I'm reasonably certain that all of the instructors are brilliant, I got the impression that some of them were coerced into doing this and didn't really want to be there.

This course is not yet ready for 'prime time', but I'm hoping that it will be in the future.This course was disappointing, especially for an institution of this caliber. Although I'm reasonably certain that all of the instructors are brilliant, I got the impression that some of them were coerced into doing this and didn't really want to be there.

The lectures were substantive in many cases, but dry in the presentation. Examples were frequently boring. Assignments often didn't match the level or depth of the topics presented. The language on the tests was sometimes ambiguous, making it difficult to understand the questions being asked, as though perhaps intended to trick. Some answers were actually incorrect, with many students commenting on time wasted trying to recalculate and understand what they were doing wrong. (Nothing!) The correct answers were never explained, so it was not possible to learn from any mistakes. Staff replies to questions and issues raised in the forum were neither timely nor frequent enough. I plan to continue the series and hope for improvement in the subsequent courses.I found this course quite disappointing overall and very uneven in content, alternating between basic concepts and complex derivations.

I kept hoping it would get better, but by the last week it had not. I'm not going to continue with this XSeries. It was unclear what they were trying to accomplish. It was in a no-man's land between a survey and then trying to get deep into something. But never building background knowledge before trying to drill slightly into something. There was a 20+ page assigned deep philosophical musing on Bayesian modeling and whether anything in the world is really inductive. But this wasn't preceded with even a basic description of what Bayesian statistics are. There are so many great examples to introduce people to priors and posteriors, but this wasn't done. Of course, there were bright spots. The course exposes you to a lot of ideas and applications. I think these are bound to inspire me at some point when I'm stuck on a problem. There was a very cool political-belief model based on your age and when you are exposed to popular vs. unpopular Presidents as you age. Fascinating to see how a whole age-class of citizens is molded a certain way based on the era they pass through.The course was well below par for EdX.

It has interesting material to learn but the way it is presented is not good at all. If i didn't have prior knowledge of statistics i would quite possibly not be able to understand and follow this course to a decent degree, because the lectures have a lot of information and move fast. It doesn't offer enough opportunity to practice the things you learn through exercises and the ones that it has do not particularly help you understand and internalise the lecture material. So you end up watching a lot of videos about theory and not retaining much due to lack of practice. I sincerely hope that the next course in the series takes these points into account and improves.I have to say that i was somewhat dissapointed by this course.

It skims shallowly into some topics in the lectures, then dunks you into a long technical pdf that you have to read to answer the "quiz" questions. Luckily it's easy (if you're a native English speaker) to skim the technical articles and guess the answers, so I got an A+ despite only understanding bits and pieces. The assignments remind me of high school busywork. You are often presented with new equation with one worked example, then quizzed only once on it before moving on to something else. There are no projects or any practical work that unifies the very different topics discussed in the course. Don't expect feedback from admins or assistants or instructors in the discussion questions. The admins do not respond at all to numerous student requests to correct errata in the site, like the correct answer not being available to choose. The professors will write equations and say "you don't really have to know the equation", or will tell you abstractly about the ideology they used to do an analysis without describing what the analysis is. The result is, you don't learn the intuition, and the ideology doesn't make sense without context. Pros: some of the lectures, particularly those criticizing classical/Frequentist statistics, are really interesting. But they only hint at something deeper and do not go into depth, and do not guide you toward entry-level external materials that you can pursue on your own. Overall: it's an interesting broad survey of topics in data analysis, but don't expect to learn how to actually do even simple data analysis. There is essentially no hand-on component of the course. Much of the meat of the course is in a grab-bag of links to external articles which are either very simple or very technical.It's very unclear who this course is supposed to be for.

After taking this course, I decided not to continue with the series. The level of difficulty and expectations of prior knowledge were inconsistent throughout the course and from instructor to instructor. Some difficult concepts were barely touched upon on the lessons, but were a large part of the quizzes. Extra resources to help learn about the concepts weren't offered, so beginners had to search out things that they didn't necessarily understand how to search for. Other concepts that seemed to be "pets" of the various instructors had more time than necessary spent on them. Lessons didn't necessarily build on each other and sometimes things that were asked about in quizzes didn't get presented until future lessons. All of this might have been okay, except the quizzes themselves weren't always clear. Several times multiple students pointed out in the discussion forum that they had interpreted a question in a way that resulted in a different answer than what the quiz required -- as multiple students interpreted these questions in the same way, this was a problem with the questions, not with an individual student. In order to "fix" that problem, the staff decided to include 5 free questions to raise everyone's grade by 5 points -- the problem was that these showed up the day before they had to be completed, well after several students had already completed the course assignments, so many people didn't know about them in time to get the points. Not completing the "extra credit" or "free questions" resulted in scores going down. While my score was still plenty high enough to receive my verified certificate, the discussion posts showed that some students' scores dropped below that threshold because of these questions. Despite tons of posts and questions about this directed at the staff, it's more than two weeks after the course ended and no staff member has responded. My suggestion -- feel free to take this course, but don't expect response from the staff if you have questions and if you're very new to this, don't pay for the certificate unless you have extra time to research the concepts you aren't familiar with.I was excited to take this course and planned on taking the series.

In order to "fix" that problem, the staff decided to include 5 free questions to raise everyone's grade by 5 points -- the problem was that these showed up the day before they had to be completed, well after several students had already completed the course assignments, so many people didn't know about them in time to get the points. Not completing the "extra credit" or "free questions" resulted in scores going down. While my score was still plenty high enough to receive my verified certificate, the discussion posts showed that some students' scores dropped below that threshold because of these questions. Despite tons of posts and questions about this directed at the staff, it's more than two weeks after the course ended and no staff member has responded. My suggestion -- feel free to take this course, but don't expect response from the staff if you have questions and if you're very new to this, don't pay for the certificate unless you have extra time to research the concepts you aren't familiar with.</review><helpful_rate>2</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>68512</course_id><course_title>Enabling Technologies for Data Science and Analytics: The Internet of Things (Past Run)</course_title><school>The Internet of Things is rapidly growing.

I believe such a course fills an important need, bridging several disciplines to convey the message that IoT is very much the backbone of data science, much more than simply an infrastructure supporting such things as Home and Industrial Automation. That being said, the actual execution of the course (as a MOOC) doesn't quite achieve these aims. As other reviewers have noted, there are several areas of the course - content, structure, delivery and assessment - that could benefit from changes. Importantly, these suggested changes are to improve the course in its incarnation as a MOOC, not as a course for a smaller, quite learned, graduate school audience. Given the diversity of content, more focus could be achieved by including more unifying lectures where the aim is to more effectively tie the disparate topics together thus providing a broader context into which they would fit. Some of the more challenging content could be perhaps be removed, or presented as optional material. Assessment could be altered. One approach would be to maintain the quiz-only approach, but expand it to two quiz levels; ordinary quizzes based exclusively on presented content, and more challenging, but optional, quizzes which would include thinking-outside-the-box questions, and more demanding problems. I recall completing a Coursera MOOC (Nanotechnology: The Basics) in which this approach was very effectively used. Another approach (as suggested by another reviewer) would be to include challenges involving programming or similar problem solving, perhaps as a peer review challenge. Finally, timely staff monitoring and response (often by TA's or equivalent) of discussion forums in such MOOC's (technical content) is quite important, and, in these days where MOOC's are no longer a novelty, but have become a mainstream educational resource, expected by students. I, myself, had a very positive experience with the course, and look forward to seeing it better succeed.I applaud Columbia University for assembling such an ambitious, inherently cross-disciplinary, course, the aim being to describe the workings of some of the technologies supporting data science.

Not just faster computers able to handle the algorithms we studied and designed at the time, but truly new approaches. The IoT topics (networks and platform economics) were interesting too. The course touched on a variety of topics and the style and organization of teaching reminded me of the courses in Delft 30 years ago - not much difference or development in teaching over that period!

This course, along with the other two from the Data Science X Series from Columbia, are full of wrongly stated quizzes that are just watching and reading comprehension, unrelated and uncontextualized content, shown by the lot of professors teaching it. It seems that it's more important to show that Columbia is an international and overpriced campus than to offer a good quality for this course. Not only this one, but the other two courses: statistical thinking and machine learning (which I also paid and couldn't get a refund) are a poor improvisation by the professors and the staff. Coming from such a prestigious university is really disappointing and I recommend to review and change the contents and methodology for future versions.I had paid for the certificate (the exaggerated sum of 150 USD) prior to beginning the course and had to ask for a refund.

Until I enrolled in this course. Looking at the list of topics, it certainly got my interest. But after three weeks, I can only say that this course is abominable, and not worthy to be on EdX. Everything about it is wrong. It is not one course, it is an amalgam of topics without any coherence or logical flow. And topics are at very different levels of difficulty, from very broad and simplistic to highly detailed and mathematical. The "course" goes against all rules of good e-learning; some professors simply read slides full of text. But the worst of it all are the questionnaires. Many questions are ambiguous, some are graded wrong, and many cannot be answered after watching the videos. So it's more of a guessing game than a quiz. Finally, staff does not seem to take the numerous complaints on the discussion board seriously. In short: this course should be deleted from EdX, rewritten by an e-learning professional, and all the quizzes need to be re-done, before it should be allowed online again.

There are no interactive activities, readings or anything else to really engage students, just three questions at the end of each set of lessons. There have been several occasions where the answers were not to be found in the lessons (especially week 9) or were so embedded that one had to be like Sherlock Holmes to find the answer. There has been almost no use of the discussion groups. No reading of the primary source (even in translation), inconsistent translations and when they made a mistake in coding the deadline for some of the exercises, no response (within 48 hours as of the typing of this review) was given by the admin personnel of the course. I am really disappointed by this as I was really looking forward to this course. I am working on the final exam now and will complete it, but I doubt I will take another mooc from Qinghua University. Very disappointing.There have been many problems with this course.

It started very promising with fascinating lectures albeit with way too easy exercises (which I can attribute to the introductory scope of the course). However half way through, the entire course was abandoned, a third of the homework was not even posted and the instructors were nowhere to be seen. Overall this course may have suffered from being too ambitious but in the end looks more unfinished than Windows ME.Honestly, I was deeply disappointed with this course.

En general parece que hay poco interés o esfuerzo por parte del profesorado en generar un curso de calidad. - El último día del curso el staff se apresuró a eliminar por completo los test de autoevaluación, problemas y el contenido completo del foro, imposibilitando que esta información pueda ser reutilizada posteriormente. ¿Acaso planean utilizar los mismos problemas en próximas ediciones, en lugar de generar nuevos problemas o preguntas?</review><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45204</course_id><course_title>Introducción a la Ingeniería del Helicóptero</course_title><school>School:  Open Education Consortium</school><review_data_id>74880</review_data_id><reviewer_name>cortes ramirez</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-05-23</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>very wellvery well</review><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45204</course_id><course_title>Introducción a la Ingeniería del Helicóptero</course_title><school>School:  Open Education Consortium</school><review_data_id>74789</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-05-20</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>Little teaching, wrong set and/or instructions of execises, even with answers corresponding to diferent questions, lot of course configuration problems, lack of some stated materials, and total non-attendance of staff in forums.

I was somewhat frustrated by some of the definitions as not sufficiently differentiating the activities of some organelles (e.g. cytoskeleton vs actin network vs microtubules).

You will not leave this course with any more skills than you brought to it. I would only recommend this course as a survey of the discipline of Machine Learning and some of it's principles. I would DEFINITELY NOT pay for the certificate for this or the X-series as I did. Worst $350 I ever spent. Reasons below. As with the rest of the courses in the X-series, this course was poorly conceptualized, organized - executed. The material veered wildly from rudimentary to overly complex (- inadequately covered) to often entirely irrelevant (no one will be taking this course to learn basic genetics, yet there were several lectures and quizzes covering it). The assessments (again, like the rest of this series) were often wrong, and more often so poorly worded as to be impossible to discern the actual question. Sometimes the assessments covered material not even covered in the lecture or reading material. Some of these were acknowledged by the course staff and some questions had to be discounted or supplemented by extra credit questions added to the end of the course. This was also the case in the previous (first) course in the X-series. Hopefully this will be fixed in subsequent offerings, but it was an issue in all 3 courses of the series, and no effort seems to have been made to improve it throughout those offerings. The staff also did not do a very good job of managing the discussion board or being responsive. All that said, there were some good info and lectures, and CUx's video lecture technology is the best I've seen. If just watching the videos as a sort of introduction to the practices and principles of the discipline, it can be enjoyable and even a bit illuminating. But don't expect to leave with any practicable skills.

The review questions were poorly worded and a few instances the subject of the question was not covered in the video. Don't waste your time with this course.</review><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>68514</course_id><course_title>Machine Learning for Data Science and Analytics</course_title><school>School:  Columbia University</school><review_data_id>118552</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-02-16</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Nice course by famous people.

There is no structure to the course. Too many complicated subjects are included without any proper background or introduction. Teaching for the most part is unclear as well. Really disappointed with this effort. I wonder how would be their full time data science MSc program. I hope they improve this in the next installment when the course is offered.This is probably the worst course on data science and on edx platform. There is no structure to the course.

On top of that there are heaps of errors in grading, which are not properly addressed and course staff seems to be overwhelmed and unable to deal with all the issues. Professors are only available for Live Q-A sessions, which is useless if you happen to live in another part of the world. This is the absolute worst course I have taken out of 20 others, I have completed so far.Course material is badly organised, lecture topics and tests are often misaligned.

The class is incredibly disorganized, lectures are all over the place with no direction or plan. The topic of Machine Learning is not even introduced until the fourth week. A better title would accurately be "Algorithms and Genomics". The homeworks are incredibly challenging and assume prior knowledge of advanced calculus, graph theory, complexity theory, and statistics. The lectures do not provide enough information to complete the assignments. The homeworks are all one or two problems with only one check. There is no explanation about answers if it it wrong. Furthermore, there have been at least three instances of the homework answer being completely wrong and the staff refusing to correct the question or award points. I absolutely would not recommend and suggest you spend your money elsewhere unless this course is completely overhauled.This is the worst course I've ever taken, so much so that I decided to write a review to warn people.

So far, this course has been one frustrating experience - quite possibly one of the worst-organised courses I have taken on edX (and I've taken about 30 or so). The black background on all lectures makes lecturers' writing very difficult to see, even in HD. The lecturers themselves could easily send one to sleep - I had to play videos at 2x speed to stay awake. The quiz questions are typically a huge jump up from the lecture video material, and you only get one (two, on rare occasions!) attempt at answering, making the seemingly reasonable pass mark of 60% suddenly difficult to achieve. Recently, the course providers suddenly decided to add additional quiz questions at the end of the course, and there have been answer errors and badly phrased questions that I (English first language) found damn near impossible to understand. The prerequisites are understated (when did high school math automatically entitle Chi-Square distribution knowledge? when did having some exposure to programming enable one to perform string matching on genome sequences?). The lecturers never bothered suggesting which software to use (e.g. R) making it daunting for a data science newbie to answer some of the questions as unsure where to begin. A positive aspect is that the course material is actually quite interesting so I'm trying to hang in there. At least I'm not on the Verified Certificate track, I would honestly be very disappointed if I had paid for this.Not sure where to start.
