It was really a wonderful experience and a great pleasure for me to be one of the students of this course. I'm appreciating so much the big work and the efforts that were done to realize it. The topics, the interviews, the videos the" what" and the" how", all were directed to increase our awareness to our behavior and ways of thinking.

The course doesn't focus with extreme details in any particular topic but has a very good balance on lots of them, a feature usually not seen in other MOOCs of similar topics.

It is very good. This was my first online course. I wanted to learn about this subject. I had some trouble with the edX platform. I watched some of the videos, which were very good. The weekly graded exams were challenging. I missed some of them due my lack of time. I learned a lot about this subject. I am retired and I graduated from Dartmouth in 1968.

It's amazing that a course of this depth and breadth is available for free. So much material is covered here, lots of different types of modeling with R and even units on linear and integer optimization with Excel. The course is well supported by Community TAs who are very involved on the discussion forums. Be warned that to do well in this class you have to be willing to commit many hours per week to completing the homework assignments, as they are very long. But if you put the time and effort in, you will come out with a solid grasp on data analysis and using R. I hope future versions of the class cover more on data wrangling and tidying, but aside from that - awesome course. Obviously lots of work was put into developing it, and, given the number of "Thank you"s that appeared on the discussion forum at the end, you know the students appreciated it.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69742</course_id><course_title>The Analytics Edge</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>122887</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Steven Frank</reviewer_name><other_review_count>39</other_review_count><other_course_completed>38</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/stevenfrank</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-07-20</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The Analytics Edge (TAE) provides a solid, engaging introduction to the techniques of "big" data analysis and machine learning -- and much more. The "much more" is how it extends the nuts and bolts of data analytics into higher-level questions of strategy, i.e., using tools not only to answer questions, but to gain an edge. The course is built around the clunky but powerful R language and, at the end, the use of spreadsheet functions to perform optimizations. Topics covered include linear and logistic regression, classification and regression trees and forests, clustering, text analytics (word clouds!), clustering, data visualization, and linear and integer optimization. Each unit consists of three lecture sequences that teach implementation of a specific technique in the context of two or three illustrative, and very interesting, problems; and a homework assignment where you apply what you've learned to a new problem. The problems are engaging and well chosen -- the real deal, applications of data analytics you've heard of and surely wondered about: Moneyball, spam filtering, healthcare outcomes and spending decisions, how businesses such as airlines segment customers to understand their markets. If this were not enough, it's only the foundation. Where the course really shines is in taking the analysis to the next level and addressing questions of strategy. Say you're a parole board member trying to predict whether a violator is likely to commit a new crime. You use various techniques to finesse a model, yet find that its predictive accuracy is no better than a baseline guess. But wait! Although the overall accuracy may be no better, your model may be tuned to virtually eliminate false negatives -- prisoners you may have thought, wrongly, were safe to release, but weren't, at the expense of false positives (prisoners you could have released, but didn't). If the strategic concern is public safety, overall model accuracy is far less important than its performance along the key strategic metric. Graded course assignments include "quick questions" that accompany the lectures, a pair of problem sets for each unit, a comprehensive final exam, and a Kaggle competition that pits you against your classmates in making predictions from a data set using all you have learned during the first half of the course. Although this is, overall, a fabulous course, there are a few negatives. The problem sets, while interesting, progressive and well thought out, can be tedious -- a lot of the tasks are trivial and repetitive, and it's not always clear what lesson the authors are driving at. And while the community TAs were dedicated (and often heroic) in fielding questions and offering help, the actual course staff was mostly absent -- a sadly common occurrence once a MOOC has had a few successful runs. As a consequence, results for the auto-graded Kaggle competition weren't released for two weeks and, when they came out, there was no explanation about how grades were computed, how the problem should have been approached (our independent variable was not well chosen, given the limitations of the data set), or why some students had weirdly high scores (they cheated, it turned out). The general lack of staff communicativeness also led to grumbling about the final exam, with numerous discussion posts questioning this or that problem. Fortunately, these lapses did not meaningfully interfere with an excellent learning experience, and can readily be corrected.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69742</course_id><course_title>The Analytics Edge</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>122721</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Siying Liu</reviewer_name><other_review_count>3</other_review_count><other_course_completed>2</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/thulsy</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-07-13</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>If you only want to take one course to learn data science using R, take this one.

Highly hands-on: you can work through all the problems following the guidance, and have experience participating in Kaggle competition. 3. The instruction -- very clear and easy to follow. 4.

I would love to take a follow up course. I feel like it could have explored the basics a little more in the beginning. Sort of have more of an introduction to what the different functions are and what they do. They were explored throughout the course but a quick preview could make for a very nice reference guide.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45509</course_id><course_title>Mobile Computing with App Inventor – CS Principles</course_title><school>School:  Trinity College</school><review_data_id>116798</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Gabriel Hornink</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-12-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Thanks to all. The course was very well structured, with motivating and challenging activities. In addition, special appearances at hangout were very interesting. I appreciated that, in addition to working the app inventor, worked out some important principles of CS and some ethical aspects involved with the CS.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45509</course_id><course_title>Mobile Computing with App Inventor – CS Principles</course_title><school>School:  Trinity College</school><review_data_id>116687</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Michał Kucharczyk</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-12-14</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>One of the best courses I had.

I found it gave an interesting introduction to a high level, blocks based language - App Inventor. I had some previous computing experience so some of the computing was not so challenging but it was still worthwhile because of the very high level language approach. As well as teaching you how to write Android Apps it also covers a number of important computer concepts such as the Internet, the Cloud service, Client-Server model, some basics of how computers work. If you are new to computing this would be an interesting way to start learning compared to Python or Java.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45509</course_id><course_title>Mobile Computing with App Inventor – CS Principles</course_title><school>School:  Trinity College</school><review_data_id>116559</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Victor Wahome</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-12-08</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>Kudos to the team behind this well-constructed course.

It has everything: clear, complete, easy to follow, but at the same time the content is non trivial at all. Professor Morelli is very clear in his explanations. But to me the most important thing is that in final project I have been able to write an app I had thought much time ago. I didn't have a clue on how to do it, this has been the first course I have taken on Android and even then I was able to code the app and get it finished. I mean: from zero to my app!!! To me it's unbelievable and the only explanation is that this course is very, very good. Thanks to all the staff from edX and to professor Morelli. It's been a really good course. I'm just waiting to see if you are going to release more Android courses like this to take them.

Yet I watched almost all videos, did amost all projects and loved it even though I didn't really have the time to do it. I loved it for at least three reasons : 1. A very well paced course, with a well thought progression from easy to more difficult, from theorical to practical. The instructor was just great. 2. Very interesting computer science themes. I especially loved the 4 bit computer part. It helped me understand a lot. The content was great. 3. I learned by doing : Creating the projects along with the instructor was a great way to learn. And when it was time to go by myself for the final project I was suprised by the ease if it.

The instructor is great all the videos are understandable and the staff is very responsible in answering any questions or suggestions on the forums. I can say that this course is gold for programmers and non-programmers, you will learn a lot and have benefit of it.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45509</course_id><course_title>Mobile Computing with App Inventor – CS Principles</course_title><school>School:  Trinity College</school><review_data_id>116490</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Erotokritos Alamanos</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-12-07</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Fantastic course, I really enjoyed it and learned a lot.

I had previously benefited from a private tutor as well as several college level courses but the progress was slow. In regular class settings there were often 15 to 20 students which means that the teachers only could progress as the majority of students progressed. Also the textbooks used in various courses were often focused on school related topics rather than practical everyday conversations. This course from Tsinghua University took a different approach from anything I had experienced before. Foremost it integrated from the beginning a focus on proper pronunciation, relevant vocabulary, reading, recognizing and writing of Chinese characters. The team delivering this course and the resources that went into preparing this course were enormous. All videos were of excellent quality. Even the free online textbook was of great help. The most important benefit of this course was in my opinion the discussion forum where each week of the course lots of people posted questions or shared resources. It is thru those exchanges I became aware of some fabulous tools to accelerate learning of Chinese. Last but not least, when the course was completed students could continue their study of Mandarin by participating in the Tsinghua Chinese Group, a FaceBook page open to all who are interested to learn to speak with 1.3 billion people. Thank you to all the staff involved in preparing this course and best wishes to all for continuing to develop followup courses.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>2</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>51361</course_id><course_title>Tsinghua Chinese: Start Talking with 1.3 Billion People</course_title><school>School:  Tsinghua University</school><review_data_id>120281</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-04-12</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The best eDX course, I really like the story line of the course.

The structure, the professors and the professionalism with which this course has been made is impressive. The course takes you on a journey at the same time as you are learning together with the main character Peter. And Peter has a small journey that he takes in his dreams. This is definitely a journey worth taking - even if you just want to learn for fun. But I am certain that if you are going to use it in your daily life then this will a great foundation on which to build the rest of your chinese learning upon. I have enjoyed every course session and you learn how to speak using pinyin, you learn the chinese characters, even how to pronounce correctly (which is definitely the hardest part).

The content focuses on useful practical sentences that you could use straight away with chinese friends or during a trip to China. The videos are very short and each focuses on a special topic with loads of nice vocabulary! Each time, you get the pinyin pronunciation with a visualization of the tones like a music scale (and the chinese characters is in the workbook so that the content stays focus on pronouncing the words in a first place!). And in addition to that you even get videos about calligraphy, which will teach you stroke by stroke how to write basic words! The teachers make the videos really enjoyable, and the fact that there is a storyline keeps the lessons linked to real situations.

They should be taught withim a context, like the other works (withim a sentence, story, etc...) instead of just be shown like in a dictionary.

I had previously benefited from a private tutor as well as several college level courses but the progress was slow. In regular class settings there were often 15 to 20 students which means that the teachers only could progress as the majority of students progressed. Also the textbooks used in various courses were often focused on school related topics rather than practical everyday conversations. This course from Tsinghua University took a different approach from anything I had experienced before. Foremost it integrated from the beginning a focus on proper pronunciation, relevant vocabulary, reading, recognizing and writing of Chinese characters. The team delivering this course and the resources that went into preparing this course were enormous. All videos were of excellent quality. Even the free online textbook was of great help. The most important benefit of this course was in my opinion the discussion forum where each week of the course lots of people posted questions or shared resources. It is thru those exchanges I became aware of some fabulous tools to accelerate learning of Chinese. Last but not least, when the course was completed students could continue their study of Mandarin by participating in the Tsinghua Chinese Group, a FaceBook page open to all who are interested to learn to speak with 1.3 billion people. Thank you to all the staff involved in preparing this course and best wishes to all for continuing to develop followup courses.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>51361</course_id><course_title>Tsinghua Chinese: Start Talking with 1.3 Billion People</course_title><school>School:  Tsinghua University</school><review_data_id>121364</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-05-24</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is very nice and useful course , I have learnt a lot and and also improved my pronunciation, I would like to see a continuation or a new course to keep improving .

Whether it was my computer, I don't know... but it really spoilt the whole thing for me. I ended up just rushing through the quiz questions, and guessing most of the answers. Many of the videos and recordings wouldn't open at all. And sometimes all the recordings played at once. I think, because I've been studying Chinese for a while, it was really just a refresher for me, which was good. But technical issues drove me crazy. I'm still not even sure if I have completed everything.

I have taught these courses to my undergrad and Executive MBA classes. I have also worked in Wall Street banks in the area of Risk Management. Prof Narayanan's lectures were very clear - I like the way he decomposed complex topics into their simple building blocks. The only drawback for me is time constraint. I audited this course just to review content. Unfortunately, I have been unable to complete the course. It would be great if courses such as these were held over a longer period of time for people like me. I hope that Prof Narayanan will continue doing similar timely courses such as the Basle regulations. Would also appreciate an Indian bent to the subjects.

After taking this course, I examined similar/other social psychology courses related to the subject of the soul (psyche) and I found they pale in comparison.

My interest, however, is in philosophy and psychology. Overall, I felt that it was worth paying for the verified certificate, and I recommend the course to anyone with an interest in the subject.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45520</course_id><course_title>Chinese Thought: Ancient Wisdom Meets Modern Science - Part 1</course_title><school>School:  University of British Columbia</school><review_data_id>117195</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Bette Nowack</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-12-30</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is an excellent course! It was the first MOOC I took and it has spoiled me. I have since taken a couple of ChinaX courses through HarvardX and they just don't live up to this one. I really enjoyed Prof. Slingerland's video lectures and the guest lecturers. It was always fascinating and very informative. The videos were very well edited and the pictures and clips inserted during the lectures were very entertaining. The length of Prof. Slingerland's video lectures was perfect. I found other courses' videos that ran in the 2 to 5 minute range to be much too short and chopped up. I found that there were many participants who made very thoughtful and pertinent comments in the discussion boards and the interactive discussions made me feel like a part of the class. Thanks to Prof. Slingerland and team for putting the effort into producing this great course. If only all MOOCS were as good as this one!</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69212</course_id><course_title>Molecular Biology - Part 1: DNA Replication and Repair</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>123614</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Carlos P.

Professors Bell and Baker are true experts in their field, and it is clear their effort, together with the course staff, to structure a very clear, thorough and well-organized course. In the lectures, there is a strong emphasis on assays, on how we know about whatever detail is discussed, which definitely conveys the idea of how science is built and has to be understood. The quizzes are demanding, but not unnecessarily or artificially difficult. They are conceived as part of the learning process, and they complete and cement the understanding of the material. The quizzes also have a marked bias towards research problems, which I greatly enjoyed, and which can be very helpful for graduate students starting or considering to start a PhD program. In summary, with no doubt I would recommend this course to anyone interested in gaining, improving, revising or updating his/her knowledge of molecular biology.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69212</course_id><course_title>Molecular Biology - Part 1: DNA Replication and Repair</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>123540</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-08-07</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is one of the best courses i have ever taken. Tge lectures were very detailed. The trial questions helped learn the concepts. The TAs for the course were very responsive - usually i got answers to questions in a few hours. Tge quizzes were quite difficult. They tested the concepts by posing real life problems, usually with assays given (eg. Electrophoresis gel images) and we were asked to explain results or asked how we would modify the assay or what the result of an experiment woukd be. I found it quite intense but very satisfying. The material covered prepares you to start tackling the quizzes but involves thinking and trial and error. Prof. Bell, who taught 7 of the 8 lectures, and Prof. Baker, are superb teachers. I learnt a lot. Thanks for offering this course for all.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69212</course_id><course_title>Molecular Biology - Part 1: DNA Replication and Repair</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>123435</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Paul Chisarik</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/pchisarik</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-08-04</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This was my second time through 7.28.1x and I found the course just as interesting and well produced as the first time. This course, as well as the other 7.x biology courses from MIT are easily among the best I've encountered in more than a dozen online courses. The lectures are very well produced, the quizzes are excellent and the support from the staff is outstanding. This all results in an exceptional learning experience that ensures true, deep understanding of the subject, complex though it may be. I completed 7.00x nearly three years ago and have completed both 7.28.1x and 7.28.2x now, having started without any formal education in biology beyond secondary school several decades ago, and I can honestly say that I have been able to acquire a far better understanding of the field of molecular biology than I would have ever imagined possible through free online courses. I did spend a bit more than the suggested 4-6 hrs per week on the class, more like 6-8 I would guess, but it was time well spent and included rather extensive note taking and research beyond the scope of the actual course material. There was very good participation in the discussion forums where many interesting discussions are initiated both by the students and the course staff which provided many opportunities for learning above and beyond the basic course content. Thanks and congratulations to the course team on a job very well done.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69212</course_id><course_title>Molecular Biology - Part 1: DNA Replication and Repair</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>123419</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Nick</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/nickb4rry</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-08-04</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course should be held up as a "Gold Standard" for online learning.

I work in a lab and have used very basic molecular biology techniques for years, but still I found the course incredibly interesting and challenging and even exciting for many reasons, scientific ones and more personal ones. Teachers are just great, each of them in his own style. I liked very much the "black board" way of Pr. Bell, combined with diagram slides, because it gives the feeling to be part of the class, and makes things very lively and dynamics. But it's a matter of personal taste, and the lessons by Pr. Baker were great and very clear as well. Test yourself questions were very useful, though much simpler than the weekly quiz, onto which I spent quite some time (up to 1h30 for some of them !). Quiz questions may be tricky, and more than once, I fell into a trap by not thinking twice, and after an initial moment of surprise at the red cross mark, I could understand, most of the time, where I did wrong (and fell stupid, ha ha). Not for all of them though, and I actually missed some kind of after test correction and explanation for failed questions, for example, something available only for those who completed the quiz. Maybe this is somewhere on the web site but I could not find it. From a scientific stand point, I was amazed to learn the basics of what I have been automatically using in the lab for years. Because of course, even if you do only cloning, you are working with such materials all the time. My initial education (25 years ago...) did not include these aspects of biology, and I am very grateful to the team for teaching me these things at an already pretty advance age (talking about my age, not the age of the team). I also want to the thank the members of the staff in the forum, they were incredibly helpul and even kind, even if I ask only a few questions myself. But I benefit from other student questions. I also want to thank them for strongly advising me to WRITE notes myself during the videos, and not rely only on the wiki notes of someone else (although I am very grateful to those who provide these notes, which will be useful to come back to, if someday I forget a detail). Writing notes works definetely better and "print" things into your brain, indeed. My favorite part of the course was the one on origin of replications, and I read quite a lot of litterature on that since then. I had no clue it was that interesting ! Plus, in general, I was amazed by the speed at which enzymes work. Even if I have been used PCR for the half of my life, I find it so incredible to imagine those proteins scanning, flying, working at that speed. Finally I wish to thank the teachers, the staff and edx for providing such top quality courses freely, and in such a beautifully shared manner. In these sometimes difficult times (I live in Nice, France, and was fortunately at home on the last July 14th), it's good to feel there is still room for sharing knowledge and passion of science, from the best universities in the world. They also manage to boost confidence of people around the world, pushing them to dare learning new things, even if you are getting older or have no money, telling them to concentrate on what matters most, becoming a better person, and that includes of course what you learn about how the world and nature really work. Thanks again and see you on the next course, on transcription and transposition.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69212</course_id><course_title>Molecular Biology - Part 1: DNA Replication and Repair</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>123312</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-08-01</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>The course content is outstanding and although advanced, it can be picked up even by those who don't have a particular background in Biology.

Staff, TA, and peers are so responsive and can provide new insights. Ideas are important. You will regret it if you only post your questions but never pay attention to others' post. The course content is excellent--most videos are recordings of real MIT on-campus courses. Get a taste of being a "MIT student," guys! ;) Really excellent, excellent, and excellent content. OK, to be serious, the course involves many assays. Assays are a huge part of this course, and are not systematically taught in most mol bio book, although you will find this series (7.28x as a whole) easier if you have read some molecular biology textbooks. There ARE some, tho, in case you'd like to take a look at those extremely thick protocols/manuals. The quizzes and problem sets are the best I've ever saw! Some problems have jsmol (not sure if I spelled this word correctly, tho) integrated, which is a fascinating figure. Yet a troubling issue is that often your browser crashes when loading that programme. :( One should not expect to go through a very easy time scoring high in this course, and should get ready to spend some time on this course. Edx is not that satisfying because many questions (like drag-and-drop questions) appeared in quizzes can not be answered or even showed correctly on mobil devices. In fact, there are people who gave wrong answers simply because on a tablet, the graphs look different.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69212</course_id><course_title>Molecular Biology - Part 1: DNA Replication and Repair</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>123225</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-07-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is an amazing class that focuses on the mechanism of, the proteins responsible for and the assays to study DNA Replication and Repair.

The quizzes just challenged the understanding that much and also helped make abstract concepts concrete. The quizzes also help in one intangible way. They help hone the scientific temper required for this kind of research and introduced not only the concepts but approaches to solving problems. This, at no cost, has to be one of the best available out there. Hats off to the staff of MITx at Dept of Biology.

The contents of this class are cutting-edge. The instructors and the designers of the educational materials have done an outstanding job here. The use of multimedia in the quizzes and exercise is extremely clever. It must have taken ages to program this on the EDx platform. You'll work with 3d interactive visualization tools to analyze molecular structures. You'll do thought (or real interactive) experiments on many, many different variants of "virtual gel electrophoresis". To do the exercises, I recommend to work on a recent PC with big screen(s). A laptop might suffice to watch the videos., though. I feel now that I can understand the life science articles in magazines such as Nature or Science much better.

The selection of the material for the course truly gave a great insight and appreciation into the complexity of living organisms. Especially unique was the integration of the various assays into the material to give a laboratory perspective on how scientists know what they know. The editing on the videos was superb, keeping the focus on just what was essential for the lesson. All this alone would be enough for high praise, but the masterfully crafted problem sets, which genuinely contributed more to my understanding than even the wonderful lectures, by demanding reason and thought, even if at the expense of requiring quite a bit of time, set this course apart. I felt as if I was actually in the lab with Brian, Alice and Rajeev, all of whom, helped make this short journey memorable. Lastly, many thanks to all the contributors on the discussion boards. I am both appreciative and humbled by their considerable intellect, knowledge, astonishing response time, and their enthusiasm for sharing it with us. Magnificent!

By that I mean that a good integration exists between lessons, two a week, each broken down into smaller segments, with very short "test yourself" questions following each segment. A weekly quiz probes not simply retention or memorization of biological facts, but the ability to be analytical with those facts in hypothetical research situations. Each lecture is short enough, always less than 10 minutes, so that the material doesn't become overwhelming in that respect. The weekly quizzes, covering all the lecture segments, are, however, quite challenging and demanding, as they require "working with" the lesson material analytically, not robotically. The instructors are both dynamic and extremely knowledgeable in this field, and the TAs seemed always ready to help with explanations. I would like to thank MIT for providing what, in my opinion, is an incredible course. Now on a personal side, frankly I did not pass this course with a 60%. I enrolled in it for "fun" because the material was so interesting, and because I took college biology many, many years ago, with just a short intro to biology course from Coursera recently, I did not have the "background" to even attempt being an ace student. Nevertheless, as something of a layperson, I did approach the material seriously, except when I randomly guessed at some segment or quiz questions because I didn't have a clue :) I watched all the lectures and took all the weekly quizzes except the week my internet service went down, which it did again the evening before the last quiz was due. I also posted a few questions in the forum, to guide my study. I would label this course as fairly rigorous or even intensive, but I think the rewards for taking it are immense, whether you enroll expecting to thoroughly master the material or enroll just trying to gain an educated layperson's perspective on our present state of knowlege about DNA replication and repair. While in some senses all I can say, because of my background, is that I was "exposed" to an incredible body of knowlege about the intricacies of DNA rather than truly mastering those intricacies through hypothetical application, the amount of fascinating information I've been exposed to is nothing short of mind boggling. For anyone, such as myself, with just a basic knowledge of DNA going into the course, I found it absolutely awe inspiring to learn just how much we now know about DNA replication and repair. The course will leave you in awe of the intricate machinery of our bodies (and those of E. coli), as well as give you a deep respect for the researchers who are busy bringing to light an ever increasing knowledge of DNA mechanisms. It will also give you an admiration for instructors who can explain this knowledge to others. Five stars certainly!</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>4</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69212</course_id><course_title>Molecular Biology - Part 1: DNA Replication and Repair</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>113668</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-09-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Simply awesome.

The lectures are brief and exact and the concurrent quizzes are easy to get through (if you pay attention to the lecture). I found it was the weekly quizzes where you really earn your keep with this course (they account for about 90% of your score). These quizzes are extremely well designed and are intended to teach as much as test. My feeling is it the quizzes more than anything that assure that what you heard in the lectures will be retained. Especially useful also are lectures on assays, which are integrally coupled to the theoretic information being provide. You will be required to interpret results of assays in the quizzes, and this where the challenge is greatest. Plan to spend more than typical hours for similarly described MOOCs. I found I needed between 10 and 15 hours per week to get good quiz scores (90+ percent). Finally, Professors Bell and Baker are exceptional. Most of this course (.1x) is taught by Professor Bell. They also have co-authored an exceptionally good textbook (with other well recognized authors) titled Molecular Biology of the Gene (2013). I believe this is one of the best MOOCs available on genetic molecular biology. I finished this course in Sept 2015. The TAs where also very good and the discussion board was very active and highly responsive.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>2</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69212</course_id><course_title>Molecular Biology - Part 1: DNA Replication and Repair</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>113559</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-09-28</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>If you're expecting a traditional biology course where you memorize terms and spit them back out, then this would not be the course for you. I've always held MIT to be the equivalent of Ivy League standards and this course gives a valid and just assessment towards that end. Old fashioned chalk boards line the front of the room, and The professor brings back the old days of high school memories, but that's the end of the "old" era in thought. This class focuses less on memorization and more on practicalum. In fact just 9% of your grade is based on memorization. The core bulk, 90% in fact, focuses on your ability to think and apply what you've learned to scenarios that are presented to you. Those with a weakness in reading assay's may want to brush up on them first as that does represent a solid portion of the course. Every quiz has questions that a person would encounter if they worked in a real world biology lab. Overall it has been an excellent teacher and course. If you want a real quality college experience, this would will leave you banging your head on the wall and deep in though, just as the real ones will.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>2</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69212</course_id><course_title>Molecular Biology - Part 1: DNA Replication and Repair</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>113523</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Adithya Pallepati</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/adithya2</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-09-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>the best course so far for molecular biology, they were very successful in delivering what they promised. you'll learn many new things rather the normal course content!

Most of the lectures are delivered somewhat rapid-fire by Stephen Bell, who does a admirable job of describing the somewhat mind-blowing chemical machinery of DNA replication. You definitely must take careful notes. The first of the weekly quizzes is a rude awakening that the course will not be easy. There is a big emphasis in the quizzes on experimental design and analysis, requiring you to figure out assays/experiments to detect the phenomena being studied. But by the time you get through the quiz you are smarter, so that's a good incentive to take the challenge and continue through the 8 weeks and learn all about DNA replication and repair. You'll never feel the same going out in the sun again! There were some glitches in the edX platform involving the PyMol molecule viewer which hopefully should be ironed out next time.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>5</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69212</course_id><course_title>Molecular Biology - Part 1: DNA Replication and Repair</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>75698</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Christian Heckmann</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-06-20</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course is excellent, as it teaches biological processes together with how they were discovered. This means it is not just random memorization of names and function of proteins. The lecturers' enthusiasm (and comments like "oh God, I know nothing about anatomy") make their lectures a joy to watch. At the end of this course you will know a great deal about how to set up experiments, how to interpret data, and the details (and what is still unkown) of the mechanisms through which cells replicate and repair their DNA.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>4</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69212</course_id><course_title>Molecular Biology - Part 1: DNA Replication and Repair</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>74812</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-05-21</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I really enjoyed this course (I took biochemistry/molecular biology in 1982; things have changed a little...) from the clear, engaging and substantive lectures, the relevant and challenging quizzes and the extra tidbits (references to PDB files, papers to supplement the course).

I have no scientific background, but I'm interested in the future of medicine: understanding the circuitry of cells (DNA, replication, repair, transcription, epigenetics). Quite the challenge, as this is new stuff, far from mainstream. I loved the clear, engaging and substantive lectures, the relevant and challenging quizzes, and the outstanding pedagogy at work everywhere, especially in the deep dives videos. In this course you will learn a lot about assays, and quizzes always put the emphasis on data interpretation. You are in a real-life lab. Among others, you will work with Brian, your error-prone lab mate, and Alice, without whom your lab would be falling apart... I found this course challenging, so I worked full-time on it and earned myself a certificate.

The instructors are masters of their craft and their support staff are superb. This class goes beyond the usual recitation and testing of comprehension. A portion of the weekly HW's/quizzes are designed to force you to think about how to use what you have learned to solve 'simulated real-world' problems. If that sounds like too much, please note that one can earn a certificate (for those who are obsessed with such things) without an excessive time commitment since the 'pass' level is only 60%.

A more appropriate name would be "Current Assays in Molecular Biology", because the emphasis is almost entirely on assays. The molecular biology mechanisms described are more detailed versions of those already described in MITx 7.00x "Introduction to Biology" (which should perhaps be renamed to "Introduction to Molecular Biology"). I had hoped there would be more discussion of such things as how the immune system works and the analogy between DNA code and computer programs.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69225</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Algebra</course_title><school>School:  SchoolYourself</school><review_data_id>123278</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Ben Nguyen</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-07-31</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>It was great.

The practical exercises are all optional. But when you put your results into the forum, then you get super feedback from other students and also from the staff team. In addition you get support from the forum in case of problems. In particular, I would like to mention Prof. Michel Buffa, which provides personal feedback and support in the forum.

The course has theory balanced with practice that is completely grounded in reality. You will make your own devices in this class. Not just a simulation course, or a math course, you will fabricate a real device and compare its performance to your predicted theory. This is a very unique opportunity that without access to a large foundry or specialized equipment you would never be able to do. Dr. Chrostowski is articulate, detailed, organized, and approachable.

Professor Foner is one of the greatest experts of Civil War and Reconstruction and these lessons are part of one of his last courses at Columbia University. In this sense, attending this MOOC is also a tribute to a life spent on research and teaching. However, professor Foner doe not use jargon and is always witty and brilliant. The readings are not compulsory but really enhance one's understanding of this fascinating period of U.S. history.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>51189</course_id><course_title>How to Save a Life: Pediatric Advanced Life Support</course_title><school>School:  The Disque Foundation</school><review_data_id>117829</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Andy Clinton</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-01-22</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This was great!!!!

I am particularly thankful for the instruction on structure, detailing of major turning points in a classic three-act plot, and advice on creating and sticking to a writing plan. If you want to write a novel, but need to overcome creative inertia, this is a great place to do it. I will say that while I found most of the content very useful, the course was a little asymmetrical for my tastes. I would have preferred a week devoted to each act, rather than groupings of smaller, specialized topics in the second half of the course. It also would have been nice to get direct feedback from a TA on my outline, rather then rely on the required comments of peers, which more often then not seemed to be compliments made out of mere obligation and lacking in analytical advice. Still, it is absolutely worth the price of admission, and you're liable to get a lot out of the course if you put a lot of effort in.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>47002</course_id><course_title>How to Write a Novel– Plan &amp; Outline</course_title><school>School:  University of British Columbia</school><review_data_id>119084</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-03-04</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Take this course!

The content taught during the course was very informative and was taught at a reasonable pace, the discussions challenged me to think about how shark research and shark conservation was conducted, and I interacted with thousands of people who also had a love of sharks. The certificate is also a great bonus since I plan on studying sharks as a career in the future.

Both the professors are very good on themselves, but their combined effort is something of unutterable greatness. The topics are inspiringly presented, in depth, using the support of lots of ad hoc simulations. The mystery part by Paul is a masterpiece of interactive sci-fi where YOU are the scientist. The complete ANU Astrophysics series is a must for any student with any kind of scientific interest.

A project-based approach is adopted which sees the student perform all the tasks needed in fulfiling an order for chess pieces, from analysing customer requirements, through to manufacturing the pieces on a CNC machine. The course, therefore, does more than describe the basic operation of a CNC machine, or teach the rudiments of G-code programming, but instead also exposes the student to important issues (i.e. standards conformance, quality) associated with a small-scale manufacturing workflow. Much course textual content is presented in image form, understandable, since both diagrams and accompanying charts comprise a substantial portion of the content. This aids clarity, makes for easily readable, quite colourful printouts, but does mean copy-pasting (if wanting to incorporate content into notes, for instance) is limited, and translation services such as Google Translate cannot be used (note: course is currently offered in Castilian only). Interestingly, the course videos have been structured in a novel way where, rather than adopting a traditional lecture format, the videos present a Q-A dialog between instructor and student. Simpler questions are answered directly, those requiring deeper explanation see an impromptu mini-lecture given. The approach adds spontaneity, and avoids the drabness that could easily result when presenting technical content. Another positive feature is that all assessments are strictly based on presented content, a practice not adhered to by many courses, but one most important in a technical course. The course does assume a knowledge of high school math, and a basic understanding of technical drawings, but this should not put off the less technical student who can still benefit from reading through the content to at least gain a familiarity with the subject. In this sense, the course works well as a survey course for non-technical persons, as well as a refresher course for students pursuing more advanced studies in the field. Finally, indications are (from staff-sourced forum posts) the next course offering will incorporate English, which, of course, will greatly expand the potential audience.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>34834</course_id><course_title>Astrophysics: The Violent Universe</course_title><school>School:  Australian National University</school><review_data_id>123305</review_data_id><reviewer_name>c j</reviewer_name><other_review_count>4</other_review_count><other_course_completed>3</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/cj1</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-08-01</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Just can't say too much good about this course! I completed the whole series (4 courses). I fully expected to crash and burn in the first two weeks, but the instructors were so helpful that I not only made it through, I did well. Additionally, Paul and Brian are a fantastic team! Brian has the funniest deadpan, and is so "blank" in asking questions that someone wrote in that he must not have much background in the topic. Only a Nobel Prize! You do need good high school math to get the most out of the class, but you can even enjoy it without doing the math exercises.

While introductory, the course is not easy (it’s MIT, folks!), but is exceptionally well taught. The first four weeks focus on axial loading (the stretching and squeezing) of bars and trusses. Next you move on to torsion and then bending. Each new unit builds on the previous one, and you see how the new concepts are elaborations of what you’ve previously learned. It all comes together in a final unit on elasticity, and there are two optional units that delve further into material stress concepts. What’s covered in class is analytical, but you’ll also begin studying the finite-element (FE) approach to solving structural problems and learn about the computational “solver” tools that engineers use every day. The FE segments neatly parallel the graded class work, with problems you’ve solved analytically now represented visually in an Akselos window. It’s a blast to see what happens to the structure – how the color-coded stresses change and the structure deforms – as you vary the applied forces and structural properties. These segments also provide a glimpse into the world beyond 2.01, where various simplifying assumptions don’t apply. The instruction is unparalleled. Simona Socrate is articulate, engaging, funny, and teaches with chalk-breaking passion. Yes, the class is taught on blackboards (many, actually), but you needn’t take notes – Prof. Socrate has already taken them for you, in color. She knows where you’re likely to get confused and patiently walks you through the minefields. In her opening video, she promises that the class will be a partnership, that she’ll be there for you – and she means it. The staff does a wonderful job keeping up with questions on the discussion board, but the most energetic poster is Prof. Socrate herself. She answers questions. She responds to concerns. She is known to quote Dante. There are 9 weekly problem sets, your best 7 of which account for 30% of the grade. A midterm quiz counts for another 30%, and the final quiz is worth 40%. All of the graded assignments are very fair – even when challenging, none of the problems go beyond what’s been taught. There are also weekly “recitations” in which a staff member solves example problems from start to finish, and Prof. Socrate sometimes posts videos solving some of the more difficult homework or quiz-prep problems. But in all cases, extensive (and extremely well-written) solutions are provided. These deserve close study – collectively, they would make a great textbook. Anyone with even a passing interest in engineering (and a decent background in basic calculus) should take this introduction to how the built world works. Every structure around you is still standing because the behaviors and vulnerabilities explored in this course have been successfully anticipated. Beams and bones, bridges and nachos -- the concepts you learn in 2.01x are relevant to all of them.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>36266</course_id><course_title>Elements of Structures</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>41985</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Chandrasekhar Pabba</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/chandrasekharpabba</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-07-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I am now in the second year of post graduation but just to understand some of the basic concepts more clearly from MIT professors, I took the course. I am one of those with good knowledge of the subject which I have already learnt. This is the first time that I am taking an online course and it is fabulous. The teaching format, material, exercise problems, assignments and everything are super and outstanding. I really felt awesome while learning the course. Particularly the way axially loaded structural elements are dealt with because starting from the basic level we got to know different things like non- linearity of the material or geometry, force method, displacement method, FEM. Generally no teacher covers like this. And this is what I felt till now an awesome way of teaching a particular topic. Any thing we learn in life, even a very small thing, if we go to the depths of it, then we will definitely know the point of it..... And I hope teachers everywhere will relate different things properly while teaching their own respective subjects. I suggest everyone who wants to know the fundamentals and basic necessary things of structural mechanics take the course as it definitely will enhance your knowledge of structural elements....</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45342</course_id><course_title>Paradox and Infinity</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>117291</review_data_id><reviewer_name>student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-01-04</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course was very interesting, but it had difficulties also.

I felt very supported by the teaching team (Damien was racing around the forum pretty much every day to answer people's questions!) and the other students. We built a great community that had frequent debates, but were almost exclusively kind and respectful. I have learned a vast amount this summer, especially for a beginner in every sense of the word!

I highly recommend Paradox and Infinity and I shall miss it.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45342</course_id><course_title>Paradox and Infinity</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>111817</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Eduardo Quiroz</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-08-21</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>It´s a good course.

Maybe not the most usefull, but surely the most interesting and the most entertaining MOOC I've ever taken. It shows so many problems in very deep way. Rayo is really amazing, he really knows how to teach his subject. And what I really liked is that in course you have acces to full footage of real Rayo's lectures on MIT. So it gives you not "only" entertainment and knowledgy about subject, but it also shows how lecture and MIT looks (wich is especially someone like me, who is only high school student and who is in country, where university lectures looks very differenc, very interesting experience).</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45342</course_id><course_title>Paradox and Infinity</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>110774</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Muhammad Dhahir</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>0</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/muhammad22</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-08-03</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course is really an amazing but a technical one, though has been facilitated by an amazing philosopher, Agustin. The course has helped me in broadening the schemes of my mind in terms of understanding some paradoxes in our both conceptual and physical world. The paradoxes available in the course urge me to be puzzled about even what seems obvious. I enjoy reading the materials like having a very tasteful meal which my mom makes. And the most interesting to me one is Yablo's paradox (The liar paradox) which looks nearly similar to Russell's paradox but in a different way about "Set theory".</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45342</course_id><course_title>Paradox and Infinity</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>110568</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jacob Regan</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>0</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/jacob7</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-07-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Paradox and Infinity is an amazing course. It's my favorite edX course so far, and the knowledge I've gained from it has been amazing. Before enrolling in this class, I had a basic understanding of Discrete Mathematics, the subject that attracted me to this course. In the 7 weeks since, I've learned so much about Set Theory, Infinities, Paradoxes, Probability, Decision Theory, and Time Travel. Even better, I still have a lot more to learn before I finish this course. Professor Rayo does an amazing job teaching and explaining this subject, and the material itself is incredibly interesting. I do not understand every topic in this course when I first see it. Before I began, I knew only the basics of Set Theory and other mathematical subjects that are covered and used in this course. Since then, I've been inspired to seek out the information I need so that I will understand the amazing material in this course. Paradox and Infinity can be a difficult course, but I believe it's definitely worth it.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>47046</course_id><course_title>The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours</course_title><school>School:  Harvard University</school><review_data_id>120650</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-04-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course is excellent.

In fact I loved it so much that I have taken it twice!! I felt almost like I was really part of the class. I was able to follow quite well, but it was also appropriately challenging. Professor Nagy is charismatic and passionate and that makes it all the more exciting to learn from him. I also LOVE the book and was so impressed with the eBook that he gave to his students that I had to purchase the physical real life book and it is simply beautiful. This course was the very first I took through EDx ( and the first schooling I have participated in, in over 20 years) and have since taken others. I left traditional school when I was 15 years old out of boredom. Had I had instructors like Professor Nagy when I was in school, I probably would have stayed. As a single mother of three teen girls, I was also able to set a good example for my daughters and show them that its never too late to learn and just how much joy a person can get from learning something. I would actually like to thank Professor Nagy (and his students, fellow teachers and other staff that made this possible!)and Harvard University for this lovely experience.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>36466</course_id><course_title>Electricity &amp; Magnetism, Part 1</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>123688</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Hindishe Lee</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-08-11</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Prof. Hafner is an outstanding, exceptional - engaging teacher.

I think Henry Mintzberg and his colleagues at McGill University in Montréal are designing a GROOC 2.0. Although the focus was on social purpose initiatives, I highly recommend this for both groups and individuals, in the private and public, as well as the social or plural sectors, who want expert guidance in the various phases of developing a project or organization. The course sessions included written and video instruction and interviews with a wide range of practitioners, like Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel Laureate who created the Grameen Bank of micro-credit. Along with the instruction, participants formed teams and developed projects as they were led through a series of course sessions: Form teams to learn and act together (Engaging) Work as a high-functioning team (Co-Creating) Learn your way to a prototype (Designing) Grow your social impact (Scaling) Find resources to help sustain your efforts (Resourcing) Discern when and how to measure your impact (Assessing) In order to fully appreciate the value of this course, I think you have to put it in the context of Mintzberg's book, "Rebalancing Society: Radical Renewal Beyond Left, Right, and Center,״ and in the context of several significant innovations in both education and social change. 1. The Internet has greatly facilitated communication and given rise to a growing population of people who see themselves as part of a global society, even when focused on local issues. 2. MOOCs - Massive Open Online Courses - have made it possible for anyone, anywhere to learn from the best professors of the best universities, all across the world. 3. The discussion forums and other developments within some of these courses have facilitated Social Learning. Learning is easier, more fun and more fruitful when it is done collaboratively. 4. This is the first of its kind GROOC - Group Open Online Course. McGill worked with edX to design a course around teams of up to 10 members. In some cases the teams came from existing organizations. In other cases, students joined teams according to an issue of concern to them. 5. DIY Social Change. There has been a shift in the way many socially conscious individuals and groups approach issues like climate change, poverty, education and community development. Rather than relying on governments or traditional large-scale aid or development organizations, they are developing smaller Do It Yourself projects and organizations. The GROOC is both leveraging and further developing these exciting and promising trends.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>46994</course_id><course_title>Social Learning for Social Impact</course_title><school>School:  McGill</school><review_data_id>117566</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Etienne Portelance</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-01-12</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course was one of the most impactful I have followed this year.

I just took the course as soon as I found it for various reasons, but mainly because I love space. The other is the fact that I study Physics and Mathematics and have some really interesting theories and concepts on propulsion systems for space travel. These are mainly based on Quantum Mechanics, but logical and highly possible with a 90% success rate and 10% probability in terms of implementation. They are not impossible, just that people prefer archaic methodology as apposed to innovative approaches. I wish to know, will one be able to register for the Verified Certification option in the future? This will really help me a lot.

I also liked how quizzes are organized. In unobtrusive step by step guidance you can understand how things work, and what earlier seemed to be a magic becomes a solid science, which does not frighten, but captivates.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>68050</course_id><course_title>Reputation Management in a Digital World</course_title><school>School:  Curtin University</school><review_data_id>123387</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-08-03</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I liked this course because I really had no idea that reputation management existed at all, and that so much things have to be monitored.

Although intense (about 4 hours a week to read and view the resources) the material was interesting, practical and readily accessible. It offered a collection of authentic First Nations resources that I have subsequently used in my teaching. There were many videos featuring personal stories and experiences of First Nations educators. Over the 6 weeks, I was exposed to a couple of dozen websites that I could readily use in my teaching practice, and offer to colleagues. I would definitely recommend this course to other K-12 BC educators.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>51341</course_id><course_title>First Nights: Beethoven’s 9th Symphony and the 19th Century Orchestra</course_title><school>School:  Harvard University</school><review_data_id>120713</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Denis Van Wassenhoven</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-04-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Outstanding!

This course is terribly terrific. The second part of 6004 continues to amaze me well. I've had no experience on the topics covered in this class.. although I found it very interesting in an amazing way. The labs are fabulous, they help u to master the lectures concretely. The final project is to build a fully functional 32-bit processor. I had that indescribable "yes" moment once I got the green mark confirming that my lovely processor is correctly working.

In part 1, we descended deep into the gate-level workings of digital circuits. In this installment we jump up a level to programmable architectures: the datapaths and control units that process assembly-level instructions into outputs. This is where you really begin to learn the design and operation of modern processors. Organized around a hypothetical, simulated processor called the Beta, the labs have you coding sorting algorithms in assembler and actually building, on the screen, a working implementation of the Beta from hardware components (which you previously built from transistors on up during the first course module). Building the Beta is a worthy and rewarding challenge requiring attention to detail, careful choices, and some creativity. The presentation, problem sets and labs in 6.004.2x are flawless -- often dazzling to us nerdy types. The lectures are never boring and always understandable, with interesting digressions into the limits of computation, the design of compilers, and the building blocks of computer memory. In addition to instruction sets and basic processor architecture, this module covers stack operation and cache design. Once again, it's about four weeks of material from the residential class spread over 12 weeks of study. This can be awkward in terms of continuity -- re-learning complex topics studied months before in preparation for the final exam can feel like prying the lid of an old paint can -- but if the relaxed schedule means more people with busy schedules can participate, it's a price well worth paying.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>48820</course_id><course_title>Computation Structures – Part 2: Computer Architecture</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>118310</review_data_id><reviewer_name>LOKENDRA SINGH RATHORE</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-02-09</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>What a course by MIT.... hats off MIT, MIT is giving excellent quality knowledge to the world. they knows what is meant to giving scientific knowledge to society .. that's why they are world best university... your contribution can not expressed by words.....again thank you so much teachers, staff, edx all who contributed to this course and other courses of mit.....</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>48820</course_id><course_title>Computation Structures – Part 2: Computer Architecture</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>117338</review_data_id><reviewer_name>kritik bhimani</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>0</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/kritik</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-02-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Experience has been very good due to extensive and challenging exercises and well designed labs .

This was the fifth part. * Evaluation activities: There are lots of quizz-like questions during the weeks and participation in discussion forums also is required. At the last week, there is a Final Assessment. * Good points: \- The lessons are well organised, with lots of supporting material and interview with experts, to aid understanding. \- Professor Bol &#31;- responsible for Part 1 to 6 - exposes subjects very well and Professor Kirby gives goods contributions during classes and debates. \- Some discussions emerged in Office Hours are very fruitful, since the professor and some experienced students can deepen some contents and clarify some questions. \- The whole course is divided in 10 mini-courses, and each part will keep open until the end of the entire course. Thus, flexibility is surely one of the best points of this MOOC. * Bad points: \- The sound is not perfect, but it is okay! That is a great progress! =D \- The obligation of participating in discussions sometimes becomes tiring, especially if you are doing the course after it had finished. * Overall evaluation: The fifth mini-course presents the History of China between the Yuan and the Ming Dynasties. Until now, this was the part I enjoyed most. I really recommend this course to those who want to know something about East. In fact, it goes beyond China. It is really awesome!

Seriously me in week 1 and me in week 12: 2 different people. I must warn you though - this course isnt's not for lazy students. At week 2 things get slightly complex, but it's just a sign that the hard work starts here. You'll have to spend great deal of time reading Python documentation and trying your hands in code. It took me about 20-25 hrs per week, more that I expected. But the reward when you submit your code and it works and does the things that you never thought you'd be able to create is just mindblowing. It's the best feeling imaginable. Espesially for someone who has very little prior coding experience like myself. I also have learnt things that are very important for every software developer: 1. Being carefull with syntax and semantics of programming language (course grader is merciless beast ;), if you're not carefull there's a lot of work to do), 2. Reading Python documentation. Such a pain in the beginning but you'll love it later, for it has all the answers. 3. To not give up when your code doesn't work. To take a break, think, write problem down, take it apart, go back and try it again until it works. MIT staff: Professor Grimsby is a teriffic teacher! Seriuolsy. All materials are so very clearly explained and lots of examples provided. And if you still need help there's a TA community in a student Forum section, they reply very quickly. Plus fellow students. I feel very priviledged taking this course and making it. Thank you all very much! Edx platform is superb: very efficient, simple and has not crashed once during my course(unlike some other MOOC websites, which we'll not mention, that would crash the day you're about to submit your work.) So overall experience is great. I highly reccomend this course for any hard working student who is aming for the 1st class knowldge. And I myself looking forward for 6.00 2 to start.))</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>70227</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>123427</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Igor Ivanov</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-08-04</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I took this course when there were only 3 courses on edx, it was my first course and the best one.

Now, if you are (wannabe) a CS student and/or have never been exposed to college-level linear algebra, then this course may prove useful. But, if you mainly care about learning linear algebra then this course does a poor job. In that case I highly recommend Gilbert Strang course @ MIT OCW. I think the Professor made a sincere, and big, effort to develop a new way to teach linalg but, sadly, it just didn't work.

I took this course with the intention of learning enough to be able to build and program my own quad. I did not learn that. I did learn a lot of things, and for that I am very grateful. I consider this course to be more of an introduction rather than a higher level course. I am starting this post in the hopes that others will add to it and then the instructors can get some useful feedback if/when they teach this course in the future. So let's get started. Pros: Great introductory course to the requirements of autonomous flight in quadrotors This course is easy to follow and even novice programmers have a good opportunity to successfully finish this course. The homework does a decent job of reviewing a person's mathematics abilities and somewhat testing their programming skills. The flow of the course is well thought out and given the length of the course, the instructors did an excellent job of organizing the material. Cons: A lot of the conceptual aspects were not very well explained during the lecture. I found this to be the case while doing the homework. Some of the homework was more of a puzzle rather than a test of understanding. For example, homework week 6 when trying to determine the correct state vector. In this exercise we were given a set of inputs in matrix form and needed to pop out a matrix. If a person did not understand the concept, but does understand the rules of matrix multiplication, the exercise was no more than a rearranging of the order of items until a matrix of the right dimensions results. It was not just in this homework, but a few places. The programming. While I am not an expert programmer, I am not a novice either. I completed the course with high marks but I did often times struggle with the programming. It wasn't so much that I didn't understand the programming, but I would have (not speaking for others) benefited by more understanding of the back end. Example: the race. At no point prior to this assignment were we given an idea of how the kalman filter was fed into the PID controller except for a slide that said the prediction is fed into the PID controller. Maybe the point was to figure that out, but the process would have been easier (and again for me, would have given a better understanding of how the program functions work together) and given a better idea of the conceptual portion of how the mathematics is implemented into the programming. I would have appreciated a little more depth in the course. Perhaps this wasn't in the course due to length or the instructors did not want to give a full type of course through this medium, but a bit more depth and exercises (especially to extend understanding of the kalman filter) would have been appreciated. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this course. I am going to continue with Autonomous Mobile Robots (ETHx - AMRx - if anyone is interested) with the hopes of extending my understanding of the subject matter. Finally, I want to say thank you to edX for creating this platform and to people at TUM Dept. of Informatics/Computer Vision for putting this course together. It was an enjoyable experience and I appreciate your time and effort.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>35736</course_id><course_title>Autonomous Navigation for Flying Robots</course_title><school>School:  Technische Universität München</school><review_data_id>110321</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Hugo Sosa</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-07-05</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Super!</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>35736</course_id><course_title>Autonomous Navigation for Flying Robots</course_title><school>School:  Technische Universität München</school><review_data_id>110302</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jeff Mason</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-07-04</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I really enjoyed this course, particularly using the drone simulator.

You get to really understand the basics and motivation for state estimation, control and application of linear algebra in describing the position of the robot in the world. Supplement this with actually implementing what we have learnt in the python based simulator really does help to build your understanding. The forums were active and queries did get resolved swiftly. One downside of this being, Instructors hardly participate in the forums. You need to understand the Probability theory and especially gaussian distribution to understand the extension of this in predicting random errors from the sensors. To make the most out of this course, one has to take the support of the literature mentioned in tandem with the video lectures(simply relying on video lectures won't work). Overall, the course is great for someone looking to dive in the field of Autonomous Robots.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>35736</course_id><course_title>Autonomous Navigation for Flying Robots</course_title><school>School:  Technische Universität München</school><review_data_id>110296</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-07-03</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Content and instructors very good.

It was definitely challenging, but very rewarding at the same time :) Some notes: Not everything you need to know is taught in the course, but where external information is required the course will often provide links (and for everything else there's google).

The assignments don't match the difficulty level of the lectures though - you only need to write a few lines of code in each problem. The small amount of work in each assignment leaves you with a good general idea of how things work, but simply completing the requirements in each assignment won't leave you comfortable programming a quad on your own. The course does give you the tools(quad simulator) to learn the intricacies, but you'll have to step beyond the assigned homework to get a very solid understanding.

The quadrotor simulator was very well done, and was enjoyable to program. It is a graduate level course, so the assumption is that you either have the prerequisite knowledge or can pick it up yourself. That said, the linear algebra used in the course is basic. The course only uses a fraction of what is mentioned in the "linear algebra review" lecture. If you can take the transpose of a matrix, you will be OK. :-) You will need to know Python and NumPy, since the homework assignments involve programming the simulated quadrotor in a subset of both. You don't need advanced knowledge of either, but a basic familiarity with object oriented programming in Python will allow you to concentrate on implementing the algorithms without being frustrated.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>35736</course_id><course_title>Autonomous Navigation for Flying Robots</course_title><school>School:  Technische Universität München</school><review_data_id>110253</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Cliff Brown</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-07-02</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>I really enjoyed taking this course. More experience with Python would have been helpful (I didn't have any) but I managed to learn the basics as I went. You don't have to write that many lines of code, but it was frustrating at times to get tripped up on syntax. I also had to brush up on linear algebra (i.e. vectors and matrices), because its been 30 years since I've used any of that ( I earned my engineering degree in 1983). All in all, I felt challenged, but was able to complete the course work by supplementing the course content with information easily found on the internet. The discussion forums were very useful too in getting questions answered. The course provides a very good overview of the control theory used in quadrotors. I feel I now have the foundation necessary to take on specific engineering problems on my own.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>35736</course_id><course_title>Autonomous Navigation for Flying Robots</course_title><school>School:  Technische Universität München</school><review_data_id>110252</review_data_id><reviewer_name>anonymous yo</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-07-02</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>content is complete. homework is relatively easy, so we can spend less time to do it. intructor look easygoing. provider.. what is provider?</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>35736</course_id><course_title>Autonomous Navigation for Flying Robots</course_title><school>School:  Technische Universität München</school><review_data_id>110250</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Rajavardhan Reddy</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-07-02</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I'm from India and I enjoyed a lot this course especially challenging assignments.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>35736</course_id><course_title>Autonomous Navigation for Flying Robots</course_title><school>School:  Technische Universität München</school><review_data_id>110247</review_data_id><reviewer_name>MARCIO MUTUNDA</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-07-02</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course is excellent, content addressed simply organized step by step content and sequentially, teachers are patient, excellent teaching, the course provider has integrity and righteousness, I recommend the course to all who wish to learn about drones state of the art.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>35736</course_id><course_title>Autonomous Navigation for Flying Robots</course_title><school>School:  Technische Universität München</school><review_data_id>110245</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-07-02</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Excellent introductory PID course.

If you are familiar with basic computer vision, 3D geometry and optimal control, you are not going to learn much more from the lectures, although the instructors mentioned that the survey results encourage them to make the lectures more advanced in the future sessions. The lectures contain several demos of working autonomous quadrocopters, though. After completing the course I don’t feel ready to take a copter and make it fly, as I initially expected. The instructors provided a really wonderful simulation environment, but the programming assignments themselves did not encourage to solve difficult practical problems, which is especially daunting given that great environment. To sum up, I think the course is too basic now, but has a great potential.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>35736</course_id><course_title>Autonomous Navigation for Flying Robots</course_title><school>School:  Technische Universität München</school><review_data_id>41923</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Tim Bate</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/tim.bate</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-07-14</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>This is an interesting course and seems to cover the basics well in the time available. Four hours seems a generous estimate. I usually took less, though there were times when I would have spent the full four hours. The course has some moderate maths requirements and some programming is involved. It would be advisable to know linear algebra (nothing more difficult than inversion) and Python. Having said that, I didn't know any python before I started, and was able to get through just fine, though it did slow me down at some points. The pracs usually involve being provided with some skeleton code and having to fill in the missing functions. For the most part this is easy, but because a lot of the functionality happens "behind the scenes" and the debugging options are limited, I did find some of the problems were more difficult than they needed to be simply because it was hard to work out exactly what was required. Why would you do this course? It provided some introductory material culminating in producing a Kalman filter to determine the position of an object in a bayesian way. Simple image transforms, integrating sensor readings and employing uncertainty were all used. If this is of interest, even if you aren't interested in quad copters, then this could be for you.

Currently working for an ISP, where reasoning is about the onlything I use from my degree. I was looking for something to do to brush up as I don't currently need to utilize my education background in my day job. This course was a decent start! The subject matter was very interesting and the lecture format (especially with the dictation) was really great. The homework however more specifically the simulator and programming assignments conceptually was also well thought out. However I think in practice was a little too easy to asses ones understanding of the material. As other students have pointed out. Most of the assignments focused on implementing one small function out of the whole weeks concept, while the vast majority was provided. This effectively kept the assignments short however didn't especially force an understanding of the overall process for that weeks material. The final weeks assignment would have been an excellent culmination to the course if not for the fact that from all the previous weeks one merely made a few edits to the previously provided code (and their previous hw) to tie everything together. I think had the majority of the programming assignments been like the final hw, it would have provided a better assessment. Regardless to the driven individual interested in learning about the concepts behind autonomous navigation and some of the techniques implemented. There is more than enough material and free resources mentioned in the course to do just that. I really enjoyed this course, I am a little bummed I didn't sign up for the verified track. I hope that this course is offered again and the instructors take into account some of the feedback on the assignments.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>35736</course_id><course_title>Autonomous Navigation for Flying Robots</course_title><school>School:  Technische Universität München</school><review_data_id>37373</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Chad Colgur</reviewer_name><other_review_count>7</other_review_count><other_course_completed>7</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/chadcolgur</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-08-26</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Fun experience with a focus on applications.

You can ace the course without it, but you might not understand what you are doing. The course covers topics like Kalman filters and basic control law theory at a high level. it does not cover Visual Odometery, Visual SLAM, path planning, ROS... it cannot cover these topics in 8 hours of lecture and 24 hours of homework. the lectures were okay. not great, not bad. It relies on the AR Drone to advertise the course, but there is no integration of the AR drone in the labs. The simulator is cool and fun to play with, but they very carefully craft each lab to focus you on 1 or 2 functions, hiding the rest. each lab requires maybe 6-10 lines of code. overall, i was disappointed in the course.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>35736</course_id><course_title>Autonomous Navigation for Flying Robots</course_title><school>School:  Technische Universität München</school><review_data_id>37041</review_data_id><reviewer_name>student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-06-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Great course.

Knowledge of numpy also helps. Fortunately, as far as I'm concerned, they do not use Matlab in this course. The homework is quite easy and just completing the homework is not usually enough to consolidate your learning, but this is the type of field that I think you only will strongly get to grips with if you try to do your own quadrotor flying, and some good tips are given for how to obtain a quadrotor and use it. I enjoyed the course, and I recommend it as fun if you already have the prerequisite knowledge.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>35736</course_id><course_title>Autonomous Navigation for Flying Robots</course_title><school>School:  Technische Universität München</school><review_data_id>36985</review_data_id><reviewer_name>student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-06-28</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course gave a very good learning experience in understanding Autonomous flying vehicles. lectures are well designed and Task for every week is competitive as well as thought provoking linking with the theory concepts taught !!</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>35736</course_id><course_title>Autonomous Navigation for Flying Robots</course_title><school>School:  Technische Universität München</school><review_data_id>36970</review_data_id><reviewer_name>student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-06-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>A stimulating and enjoyable course, but needing extra work if you are weak on the prerequisites.

The first time I tried this course I dropped it because I thought it was getting to be above my level but I tried it again and found that with a little review of linear algebra it was quite manageable. It does not require any background in quantum mechanics and in fact serves nicely as a first exposure to that field. My only criticism of the course was that the final lectures got a little esoteric and the tone got a bit contentious as the professor took apart claims than an actual quantum computer has been built.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45492</course_id><course_title>Solar Energy</course_title><school>School:  Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)</school><review_data_id>123059</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Sarah Megens</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-07-24</review_date><review_value>1</review_value><review>The course is quite bad.

I'm looking to pursue graduate studies in sustainability sector and this course was a definite eye opener. I spent a lot of time reading additional materials - I also purchased several books mentioned by Professor Jose. What I really loved about the course was the 'Thought leader' interviews. I looked them up, followed them on twitter and read more news about them. What I thought could improve on the next round was, the assignments. I think it tested what I remember than what I actually learnt. Overall, I enjoyed taking this course, it was enlightening and I could draw parallels to the firm I work for.

It covered so many aspects of Ancient Egyptian History and I really liked that they included all the facts in the videos in a sequential order. I learnt a lot about Ancient Egyptian history that I never knew of. I found the exercises, assignments and the quizzes extremely beneficial with sticking the facts in my mind. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in ancient history as it is a great foundation for further education!</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>66273</course_id><course_title>Ancient Egyptian Civilization</course_title><school>School:  Bibliotheca Alexandrina</school><review_data_id>121104</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Marie Langthorne</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-05-15</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This was a fantastic introductory course. It covered all the basics in a way that has left me wanting to learn more. It would be perfect for someone with little or no knowledge of Ancient Egypt who would like a starting place that provides enough content to keep it interesting not so detailed that the beginner becomes lost.

Prior to taking it, I had attempted to read programming books with the intention of learning how code. It didn't take long before I realized that I hated reading books about programming. Not because the books I read were uninformative (though there are plenty that I could nominate as morbidly boring) but rather they lack the type of interaction to be found in a MOOC; which as a beginner is crucial because when you get stuck you need help from your peers. The main lesson to take away from this course certainly has to be systems thinking which is emphasized throughout by the professor. As I build up my programming experience with each day that passes, I am slowly beginning to appreciate the massive advantages it offers. Whenever I wrote a program that didn't do what was required, more often than not it was because of my adopting "verbal reasoning" as I punched in the code. As soon as I started asking myself the "why" and "what" certain pieces of code in the program were doing, I quickly found where I'd veered off course. As a beginner, I did this course slower than most (just over a month) but I believe the extra time I spent on it will certainly pay dividends in the future. To sum up, I rate this MOOC very highly and look forward to completing SPD2 and SPD3.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45323</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Financial and Management Accounting</course_title><school>School:  ACCA</school><review_data_id>123690</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-08-11</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I have taken the course as an introduction in financial accounting because I got a job as IT consultant in SAP reporting environment (BW) mostly for our finance department. It really did help a lot to understand the basics of accounting and thus about our financial department (for the first time!). The course is really clear and with good excersises. The only thing i really found difficult is that the 'adviced' time spend on the course was 5 hours, but for me, it took me at least that time. Most weeks about 6 hours. Apart from a busy day job and some social stuff it takes a lot longer for me to complete the course. I am now about halfway (after half a year) and steady going and coming back to it, because it is really a good course (if i have time...). I wanted especially to finish the second part but understand that without the first half you cannot really do the second part. So still going and hopefully finish this year. So no, I am not a finance student and will never become. But I would and already have told a lot of people about this course.

I had background in embedded systems and C programming from my Bachelor's degree as well as in my profession, and took this course to expand my knowledge and try different projects. This course would be fairly difficult without first having a good understanding of C programming and programming principles in general. The materials don't dig deep into the very basics of programming but seems to be designed for those with some previous knowledge. Professor Valvano and Professor Yerraballi have done an exceptional job at creating the labs and making them interesting and instructional. Their videos lay out the individual labs and contain useful information. This was a fun and useful course.

Esta curso debe ser la base de discusión de la gestión de recursos hídricos en América Latina, y quizás un modelo a seguir por las demás regiones del mundo. Los lineamientos de los módulos y la simplicidad del lenguaje hace de este MOOC una formación al alcance de todas las profesiones relacionadas al agua. Felicitaciones al BID y a UNIANDES, espero que este MOOC se repita y que tenga una acogida mayor. Saludos desde Québec (Canada).

Covered basic topics a programmer would like be introduced to in a new language. The video demos were the best I have seen on edX so far. I really appreciated that the course is not an introduction to programming (there are way too many of those,) but is shaped for current programmers. A more advanced follow-up course would be great (there is always the stackoverflow and the rest of the Internet, but it really helps having the gist boiled down to a few short chapters). The Step by Step book is a very good additional resource though and MSDN has all the details. Coming from C/C++ (and a bit of Java) I was actually surprised how many improvements in language (and documentation) C# adds to the game and I ended up really liking it. Developing with C# aided with Visual Studio is such a breeze. I tip my hat to Microsoft.

One of the best courses which gives both theory behind the software and the usage of software. Also, a bonus of industry perspective of simulations are provided. The problems solved have real world applications. The content is exceptionally well prepared, organised and delivered. I had used ANSYS before in APDL form and not in Workbench. The course helped in locating the options in Workbench and also to visualize the simulation results in a better manner.

The lecturer promotes his view strongly - and as noted in another review- the scripted format makes the interjections from the interviewer contrived and stilted, and makes the lecturer come across as hectoring and patronising. (It should be noted that the lecturer's credentials to teach this topic are impeccable - see Wikipedia) Notwithstanding these criticisms, the argument and factual content of the course is very good.

I enjoyed the way they worked together to teach the material - found the lectures very engaging - fun, as well as informative. I had never taken a marketing class, but actually work in a marketing research firm, so a lot of the concepts were very familiar to me. I would have liked to gone more in-depth because of that, but for beginners with no background in marketing, I'd highly suggest this course.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>51339</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Marketing</course_title><school>School:  University of British Columbia</school><review_data_id>123377</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Aryamik Sharma</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-08-03</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>One of the best course I have taken so far.Happens to be a quite informative,challenging as well interesting.The amount of examples provided in the lecture will definitely be an eye opener for some of you.You will start thinking about Marketing on a different level thanks to the quality of the course.Darren Dahl and Paul Cubbon are pretty good instructors and have a good way of explaining things.Trust me you will gain a lot after completing this course.

It is well structured, addressing a range of themes that can pose problems throughout the PhD process (and indeed in academic life in general). The weekly activities are relevant and have useful applications right away. Another valuable part of this course was the camaraderie it fostered between students in all sorts of geographical locations. I would recommend taking this MOOC early in your PhD if possible so you have some idea how to deal with challenges, but if you are further along it is also useful, and your experienced advice will be appreciated.

It made it come to life and less imposing than I thought it might be. The lecturers were open and approachable and humerous - it wasn't too slick or exclusive which is a real strength. I was unaware of the amount of people who would sign up for it and this made me feel less responsible somehow to responding to posts. I did not finish the course due to lecturing commitments and studying the Science of happiness course - but this is me over committing and will learn form this for next time.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69981</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Solid State Chemistry</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>117031</review_data_id><reviewer_name>David Moses</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-12-23</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Fascinating class, brilliant professor, extremely enlightening and inspiring.

I have really enjoyed Professor Cima's lectures. I had studied some of these topics before and thought that this would be a refresher, but I am certain that during this course I understood much of the content for the first time. The system suits me perfectly. Being able to pause the lecture and repeat some, or all, of it, is ideal. I guess I am a little slow on the uptake and I needed to put in more than the recommended time.

That has a lot to do with the interesting choice of topics, consistent structure, and great visualizations. The info-graphics at the end of each section are brilliant! The presentation quality of the tutors varies, with Paloma Diaz standing well ahead of the pack. There are however severe "quality control" issues. I would highly recommend engaging a native English speaker to review the course contents. I frequently had to guess what the actual question was during the quizzes. There are also a couple of lectures that need an overhaul, for example, the lecture on Big Data is below par. As Big Data will play a very important role in building the Digital World, a high quality lecture on the topic is a real must. A very big thanks to the team for creating this course.

It was far better than I expected. Very interesting and challenging, however also quite demanding. I think it is a good balance between 'easy to eat' cosmology-related TV shows and the reality with maths and physics in the background. I also enjoyed the way it was presented, challenging home works and the exam which allowed me to go through everything I learned during the course. Interviews with invited guests added also extra flavour, as I could hear other opinions and speculations. And from my point of view the course doesn't try to make your mind, it actually opens it, by showing how many unknown factors we still have and how many interesting discoveries we should expect in the nearest future. I'm glad I enrolled and I could experience it.

The lectures for this course were quite challenging but also very entertaining. It is very well structured and the instructor, prof. Yaser S. Abu-Mostafa, illustrates nearly all concepts using simple examples often with some visual aids (graphs, figures, sketches) and speaks slowly and clearly making the content much easier to digest. Having participated in this course I truly believe that more than deserves all the teaching awards he has received over the years. The lectures are rather brief so after watching one for the first time you may think that it could have been more in depth but, I can assure you, the lectures contain everything you need, nothing more and nothing less - this is something you will greatly appreciate when preparing for the final. If you do not intend to use the book, you will probably end-up re-watching lectures or at least portions of them before and while doing the homework (that is how I did it). I remember the homework being quite difficult and the answers not always very precise (it's machine learning, in some cases results will vary slightly from one attempt to the other). Definitely set aside plenty of time during the weekends, the estimated 10-20h a week is not exaggerated! I would watch the lectures on Saturday mornings and give the homework for that week a shot in the afternoon, on Sunday morning I would wrap up what was not finished and give exercises where I got stuck a fresh look. You may get frustrated at times when you get a wrong answer but I think the lack of 2nd chances makes all the correct answers so much more rewarding. The professor supplies plenty of inspiration and motivation during the lectures to make you want to really understand the material and work on the homework till you get it right! I would recommend having some prior exposure to programming using Matlab or similar because you will be on your own on that front (as the professor says, the course content is not dumbed down for popular consumption).</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69885</course_id><course_title>Learning From Data (Introductory Machine Learning)</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>122875</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jacek Czaja</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-07-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Wondeful course content for all of those interested in Machine Learning that are searching some understanding of learning , rather than exercising number of methods without deeper context.

It was difficult for me, because I always looked at problems in the same way, from the same perspective over and over again. But since I finished the course, I retreat and try to understand simple things deeply (as we learned in this course), as well as use basic models in order to solve more difficult problems. You need to take your time for this course because if you're in a hurry, you'll miss all the good stuff.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69985</course_id><course_title>Effective Thinking Through Mathematics</course_title><school>School:  The University of Texas at Austin</school><review_data_id>110319</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Sue Panahi</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-07-05</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>I was excited about taking this course. I seems the professors is quite knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the subject, however after going thru the first few modules and getting into the real material, it became difficult to get anything of value. The process of watching students working thru the problems and explaining without any visuals for us ( the online students to follow) or any solution to problems to check against our work makes the whole process worthless. This is a MOOC we need visuals instead of talking heads to get the material. I wish someone would take notice and revamp the material into a more MOOC friendly format. It is worth learning!!!! so sad..</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>48830</course_id><course_title>Foundations of Data Analysis - Part 1: Statistics Using R</course_title><school>School:  The University of Texas at Austin</school><review_data_id>121612</review_data_id><reviewer_name>John Rosenfelder</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-06-02</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>One of the best online classes I have ever taken, out of about 20.

R is used as a tool,learning how to use it is not the focus of the course. Although it was useful as a good first contact with the program, because video tutorials are clear and straight to the point, and allow you to see what R can do. Material is very well organized, content is clear and focus on main ideas. Exercises help to understand key concepts. I totally recommend it, and also Part 2.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69229</course_id><course_title>Políticas efectivas de desarrollo infantil</course_title><school>School:  Inter-American Development Bank</school><review_data_id>123892</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Alba Arriola</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-08-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Me gustaria realizar, el curso es una muy buena oportunidad de conocer y aplicar herramientas que nos permita resolver los conflictos de niños y niñas en situación de vulnerabilidad.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69229</course_id><course_title>Políticas efectivas de desarrollo infantil</course_title><school>School:  Inter-American Development Bank</school><review_data_id>122850</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Carlos Ajitimbay Cruz</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-07-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Saludos a todos los compañeros del curso.

Also, the per-requirements can be acquired by googling the particular topics. However, I am too happy to have opted for this course. It means a lot to me, as I am being taught by world class professors, me being in a not so-good-in-edication country, especially in social sciences. Good syllabus, well covered fields in the subject at hand, brilliant teaching, and I have also learned a bit much of eviews through this course. Also, the timings and level of this course is fine, and anyone who is interested in economics, and hence econometrics, may go for it.

Time series data and Forecasting is my weakness, I hope through this course my skill will be improved. the concept of cointegration among unit-root variables and its implications for forecasting. Learn how to test for cointegration using the Johansen method and how to estimate and forecast using a VECM. These things are mys expectation. Eview is familiar to me also because I had used it in student time. However, at present I donot have eview software. According to my reading from the web, I see that the instructors are experience and matched the requirements of the course.

The course describes basic probability theory, how to use statistical data to calculate numerical values related to a life insurance scheme et cetera. This is my first course on edX, and if the rest are as good as this I will definitely continue taking courses here. Everything in this course (except some of the probability theory) were new for me. However, the course material is easily explained and there are plenty of exercises in different difficulties. Adam has done a great job with this course.

Of the many MOOCs I’ve completed, your course is one of the best I have seen. The interviews with actuarial practitioners provide a window into some of the opportunities in the profession. In addition to the excellent lectures, your videos of solutions to the problems were extremely helpful, especially for learning to use Excel efficiently. The problems were well thought-out, and the final was an excellent review of the whole course. I would certainly recommend this MOOC to any mathematics undergraduate who is trying to figure out what to do after their BA. I could also envision university and colleges who do not offer courses in actuarial science contracting with ANU to use the materials in this course, with the help of a qualified local instructor, as the basis of a short introductory course. (The so-called upside down classroom is one in which the students watch lectures at home and get help in working on problems in class.) In fact, the content of this course is very useful for anyone who has to handle money, which is everyone! Even those of us with mathematical backgrounds may not necessarily know how to organize financial calculations. We retirees are always busy studying our cashflows, refinancing our houses, thinking about investments and annuities, sending streams of money to our feckless offspring, organizing our tax records, and generally doing frequent spreadsheet calculations. After taking your course, and especially after finishing the final, I feel prepared to tackle any financial calculation and produce a beautiful (and even correct) Excel spreadsheet.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>46947</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Actuarial Science</course_title><school>School:  Australian National University</school><review_data_id>116993</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-12-22</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Well taught and in an excellent format of short interviews with an area specialist followed by a lecture from the specialist and then spreadsheet oriented exercises.

The course is structured in an engaging way. The part I liked especially is on modelling and simulating different insurance scenarios. It also imparted knowledge of dealing with uncertain cash flows. The interviews with people from industry folks added more information and gave an overview as what they do exactly on job. The instructor was kind enough and patient in clarifying the doubts. Overall, it is a great course to begin with, if you are looking forward to tread in actuarial path.

The instructors have put a lot of effort in providing a full set of learning material; everything is downloadable -videos, subtitles, written courses, example Excel solutions, and even detailed explanations to assessment questions. I disagree with the reviewer who said that there were no practical examples; maybe this person did not follow the lessons long enough. And it is Actuarial Science, so the fact that there is a lot of Mathematics involved should not come as a surprised to anyone. An example of the amount of thought that has gone into this course is that the timing of the assignments is given in Coordinated Universal Time. A clock set to this time zone can be seen ticking away in all the relevant pages, so that nobody can miss a deadline because of time differences. I have completed several MOOCs at EdX and other platforms, and this one stands out very positively. Students are constantly encouraged to take part in the discussions and the enthusiastic staff answers any question almost immediately. Unfortunately EdX' discussion interface is not very user friendly, to put it mildly, so I find myself avoiding using it.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>46947</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Actuarial Science</course_title><school>School:  Australian National University</school><review_data_id>115606</review_data_id><reviewer_name>marco solfato</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-11-15</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>great introduction to this specialized field, every day there are new challenges where as a student you are put in a situation to learn and apply the lessons wth practical exercises.

I dropped out after only a few. The computer interactions were very awkward. I did not expect to be asked to post videos,etc. Those processes are not possible with the slow web connection here. The lessons involve a lot of meat cooking. Being a lifelong vegetarian I didn't think how much other people want to cook animals. For the right audience, computer and meat oriented people, it's a very good course. A real college level class that does take quite a lot of time. I did participate nearly 2 years ago, just now looking to sign up for another class and decided to add my experience here.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>36403</course_id><course_title>Science &amp; Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science</course_title><school>School:  Harvard University</school><review_data_id>120427</review_data_id><reviewer_name/><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/jll</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-04-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course is apparently intended to offer a physics course for non science students and a cooking course for science students. I have worked in the restaurant business for years and done some food writing, but most of the content was new for me or went into much more depth than I had previously known. With a graduate degree in languages many years ago I found the physics extremely challenging, but meeting the challenges, which involved refreshing my old math and physics basics, was part of the satisfaction of the course. There were a few moments when I felt the instructors made assumptions about the abilities of the students, but all in all explanations were good. More than introducing me to new concepts , the course dispelled incorrect ideas I had about food science and preparation. The lab assignments were at times frustrating, partially because I did not have the right equipment, but the results were fascinating and often very tasty. I highly recommend this course to anyone in the food industry as well as devoted cooks.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>36403</course_id><course_title>Science &amp; Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science</course_title><school>School:  Harvard University</school><review_data_id>118462</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Claudio Felicioli</reviewer_name><other_review_count>58</other_review_count><other_course_completed>58</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/claudio8</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-02-14</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course is great both in the culinary and in the scientific content. Great chefs present the various topics, with a final formal presentation of the physics that makes it possible. The course assignments require you to make culinary experiments and collect data. The main topics are heat transfer, diffusion, emulsion, gelification, Maillard reactions and fermentation. You will get better at cooking without feeling like a witch doctor anymore! It was unexpected and very effective how the only basic knowledge about Maillard reactions could improve even the most simple recipe.. my amatriciana sauce pasta will never be the same :)</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>36480</course_id><course_title>Essential Human Biology: Cells and Tissues</course_title><school>School:  University of Adelaide</school><review_data_id>121820</review_data_id><reviewer_name>monicka thigazum jothi</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-06-12</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>nice i had blast with this course fine but it proviede free education for all people wtih scope of learning new and exploring the knowlegde by new generation like wise its weird in sense to judge our self assesment .so its advisable to keep many test and writings so that evyone can devlope knolegdeto survive in this competive world to face hardtime of getting the career as the main goal in their life</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>36480</course_id><course_title>Essential Human Biology: Cells and Tissues</course_title><school>School:  University of Adelaide</school><review_data_id>121499</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Virabhadrasinh Gohil</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-05-30</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course is superb, very rich in content and very informative.

The educational approach is excellent with theory directly followed by review questions, hands-on practice on a variety of problems and a variety of databases and a graded quiz. Equally well I think worked the request to submit a proposal of research which made me think (very thoroughly) about output variables, counterfactuals and controls, data sources and possible methods of analyses. Despite I am new to the R programming environment, I had no difficulty following the course and I am now more than sure I will work with R in the immediate future. An enjoyable course worth the effort and the money.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>70232</course_id><course_title>Policy Analysis Using Interrupted Time Series</course_title><school>School:  University of British Columbia</school><review_data_id>119379</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-03-15</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Course was extremely well-structured, appropriately paced, and effectively supplemented with datasets, examples, and research papers.

What a course. Simple, fun and very informative. Mr. Thomas is such a wonderful teacher. I had no prior experience with it and I was quite glad with how much I had learned by the end of it. I fell really privileged to have taken this beautiful course. Thanks to all the staff for making it available here in edX. I hope to see a lot more of the First Nights series. If I can make on minor (very minor) critique is that the voices part seems a bit lacking and I had to look for other sources to understand the voice types and all that. I don't mind looking for external sources to complement the content (I think thats actually positive) but I do feel that on that part the content could have been a little more detailed.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>48819</course_id><course_title>First Nights: Handel’s Messiah and Baroque Oratorio</course_title><school>School:  Harvard University</school><review_data_id>118925</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Besart C</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-02-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Amazing course!

In most courses we just watch the videos and answer quizzes, but with this one it's different - you have to actually put the knowledge to use. The videos were fun and interesting, as well as the entire contente. This was an easy, breezy course that was interesting without being too heavy. I love the fact that Prof. Von Hippel distributed his book through Creative Commons, so we all could benefit from it.

Best course I have come across! Changed to this course from different course on edX that was far more theoretical. I love that this course focus on practical real world problems to solve when doing the exercises. There is a good balance between what is taught in class and the difficulty of the exercises. A minus is that some examples in the beginning only run in Firefox 32bit... Ignore that an move on.

The work load was extremely light, so one can follow it easily even at the most stressful weeks. I have been listening to jazz for over three decades and have still found the course engaging and interesting. Some of the artists I already loved have been treated in a way that has shed new light over them. I have been able to discover new aspects of styles I didn't (and in some cases still don't) like at all, but undoubtedly, I understand much better now. My only criticism is that I would have liked to have more Jazz facts/ extra listening quizzes, but that does not diminish the value of this excellent course.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>49848</course_id><course_title>Human Origins</course_title><school>School:  Arizona State University</school><review_data_id>121221</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Edyta Skrobiszewska</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-05-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The last time I learned about human evolution I was still in primary school.

Yes, I learned a lot about human journey, but more importantly, I realized how amazingly fascinating we are, as a species. And how much of us we can see in our cousins. Kudos to the entire team.

Well organized, well presented by one of the top paleoanthropologists. Dr. Johanson is a pleasure to listen to and speaks so clearly that he can be understood at 2x speed.You learn a lot of information at a reasonable pace so it's not overwhelming. It is a little more challenging than other MOOCs but so well taught that it is very manageable. They use excellent learning tools and a very fair, though challenging, grading system, unlike some MOOC's. It is a model MOOC and I strongly recommend it if you are at all interested in learning about human origins.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45231</course_id><course_title>The Rise of Superheroes and Their Impact On Pop Culture</course_title><school>School:  The Smithsonian Institution</school><review_data_id>118545</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Lorena Duenas</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-02-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I took this course last year and has been my favorite so far, i really enjoyed it.

These are not the actual instructors though and only appear in video form. (Which is pretty much what I expected.)The course has some kind of laymen volunteer mediators but would benefit from a real instructor. Do take the course and watch the content but don't work too hard on the homework! I had submitted my final project 10 minutes before the deadline and no one even looked at it since it was buried on page 21. To make matters worse, they archived the whole course and kicked us all out of the Facebook page to make room for new student only 24 hours after the submission deadline. This leaves no opportunity to receive feedback from others. The so called "top 40" projects that were voted in are mainly the first ones that were submitted.

The course is very thorough in the way it introduces the concepts of hypersonic flight and scramjet vehicles step by step, building upon each section in order to achieve its objective: the project (simplified, of course) of a scramjet engine in all its components. This allows the student to grasp the behavior of the flow fields at each component of a scramjet and see the bigger picture of the entire engine. The course was definitely well structured, with no hesitation to develop pertinent equations and analyzing its components, showing well the physical implications of the mathematical formulation. I certainly recommend this course to anyone in the field and also to anyone who is interested in hypersonics, but without prior experience.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>35931</course_id><course_title>Hypersonics – from Shock Waves to Scramjets</course_title><school>School:  The University of Queensland</school><review_data_id>42713</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-07-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Fantastic course.

Mr. Harrison presents the material well both in text and in his video lectures.

Bootstrap has a standard set of classes that allow developers to quickly create applications that scale to devices of all sizes, and incorporate common components such as dialog boxes and validation. Bootstrap has become a de facto standard for web design. This course is designed to be a primer on Bootstrap. By the end of the three modules you will have gained the knowledge to create pages common to all web applications, and implement the most frequently used components and classes provided by Bootstrap. You will also see how to use the tooling provided by Visual Studio to assist you in creating pages as quickly as possible.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45206</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Bootstrap – A Tutorial</course_title><school>School:  Microsoft</school><review_data_id>111799</review_data_id><reviewer_name>student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-08-21</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Very thorough in terms of covering all that you probably need to know to start you off with Bootstrp!</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45206</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Bootstrap – A Tutorial</course_title><school>School:  Microsoft</school><review_data_id>111212</review_data_id><reviewer_name>student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-08-09</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>One of the best courses i've taken here in edX!!

The only hold up is not everything in Bootstrap are covered but at least you will gain a better understanding of the important basics like the grid layout, offsets, navigation menu, accordion and modal. Using visual studio is just optional and you can use any text editor from this course.

I learned so much, I can't even explain. Ok, here I'm talking about the history part, how everything started, writers, poets, scientists, and later on what happened during and after World War 2, and then with Sputnik, Mercury, Gemini, Apollo... Captivating and detailed story that these guys really managed to explain well. As to the physics part, it was really hard for me (I don't have the scientific background) but I did listen to all the lessons and was even able to do one or two exercises (like to calculate the amount of fuel needed for a rocket to carry a certain payload) and was very proud of myself (I think I event jumped of joy). The course was interesting from the first to the last second.

This course taught me a lot of thing about integration. It made "Integral" closer to me, not so far like I learned in my old country. In fact, I didn't know why we learn Calculus then. It wasn't until I took this series courseware of MIT. The course has a perfect flow of lessons and interesting problem set, which helps students interface Integral slowly and carefully, step-by-step. It actually blew my mind, and I learn many things from this course. I sincerely thank Prof. Jerison, Prof. Staffilani, Dr. French, and Dr. Chu for making this real!

The content is in-depth, well-structured. The instructors are clear at giving step-by-step explanations to not-so-easy-to-understand concepts. Especially loves the quizzes that allows us to key in any expressions and even sketch graphs, and the grading can be done automatically! (I guess should have some AI involved). The content and quiz questions were very challenging. As an instructor of this topic at my institution, I still need to spend 4-6 hours per week going through the materials. Overall, an excellent course. I wish I could gain the experience of going through this MOOC to teach this topic.

I found it extremely interesting, largely because of the excellent lectures by Prof. Chad Hansen, and the beautifully presented videos and handouts. Prof. Hansen clearly has a great depth of knowledge, along with enthusiasm, humor, and a friendly presence. One can spend a great deal of time with the additional readings, or stick to the videos, handouts and quizzes, as I did; and still learn a great deal. This is one of the best online courses I've ever taken, and I would recommend it to anyone.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>35927</course_id><course_title>Humanity and Nature in Chinese Thought</course_title><school>School:  University of Hong Kong</school><review_data_id>123579</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Pilar Reyes</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-08-08</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Although I didn't complete the course (no essays) due to time constraints, (I watched all of the lectures and did all the quizzes) I want to say that I really enjoyed the experience.

More reasons: I loved the introductory melody for each lecture and the quizzes at the end of each lecture helped me to summarize the main points. Thanks production team guys, an excellent job. Oh, I forgot something important, I enjoyed the humor that permeated the lectures and, again, beautiful animations.

I posted this review now, having retuned here to obtain a citation of professor Hansen's notes for an essay for the University of Oxford on the subject of the commensurability of Eastern and Western ethical systems.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>51355</course_id><course_title>Introducción al desarrollo de videojuegos con Unity</course_title><school>School:  Universitat Politècnica de Valencia</school><review_data_id>121691</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Acuña Emiliano</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/acuna</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-06-06</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>El curso es muy bueno para introducirse en las herramientas basicas de Unity,ahora solo tengo ganas de seguir aprendiendo por mi cuenta hasta que aparezca un curso mas avanzado del tema</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>51355</course_id><course_title>Introducción al desarrollo de videojuegos con Unity</course_title><school>School:  Universitat Politècnica de Valencia</school><review_data_id>119975</review_data_id><reviewer_name>jose martinez</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-03-31</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Había trabajado en unity pero no tenía claros algunos conceptos.

It's well presented, interesting, covers a lot of ground, and just plain FUN! I learned a lot about tropical coastal ecosystems: that it's not just about the coral reefs, that the significance of the Great Barrier Reef is so much more than the tourist industry; how to recognise different organisms in a square of reef, and more. The fun bit is the lectures in the field (or the water) - you see the mangroves, the reef and the seagrasses, there are even lectures delivered underwater.

The lectures were for the most part good (main professor was great but some of the others were hard to bear). A lot of lectures were almost powerpoint like, and once in awhile you will hear the speaker's cell go off, and they turn it off immediately. The exercises were for the most part quite easy. There were a lot of typos/sp errors throughout the text though and sometimes the questions and lecture don't match up (the answer could be in the following lecture). The content of the course is extremely important and definitely worth at least an audit. I took it for a certificate and ended up around 92% without given too much effort. I'm glad I took the course and will be looking forward to expand my knowledge in this area.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45467</course_id><course_title>Making Biologic Medicines for Patients: The Principles of Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>123937</review_data_id><reviewer_name>student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-08-19</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>The whole course make use of 2D and 3D animation to explain all theories from molecules to process equipment, You won't be able to see any blackboard.

It really helped me to build a mental map of the programming paradigms and prof. Van Roy has, without a shadow of a doubt, a a far reaching understanding of the matter. I felt compelled to finish the exercises and had fun with both the lectures and the practical tasks. The only downside from my perspective is the use of the Oz language, which adds additional load since probably nobody taking the course is not familiar with the syntax and rules of the language. It's use is well justified, however it is not a language that would otherwise be of a practical use. Still, I can only recommend.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69240</course_id><course_title>Paradigms of Computer Programming – Fundamentals </course_title><school>School:  Université catholique de Louvain</school><review_data_id>117069</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Beroal Beroal</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/beroal</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-12-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>First, I should say that I am no newbie in programming, so I don't know how newbies will perceive this course. As you probably know, there are two courses: “Fundamentals” and “Abstraction and Concurrency.” I took “Fundamentals” as a prerequisite to “Abstraction and Concurrency.” This course starts with functional programming which is a good thing because it prevents the imperative mindset. The course introduces an operational semantics of a programming language and its use in verification. This heavy lean to computer science is unusual among programming courses. Even some elementary exercises got me thinking. So this approach definitely is good. It's a pity that it is almost neglected in “Abstraction and Concurrency.” There are lectures on data structures (for example, trees) and efficiency (complexity) of algorithms. IMHO, they are a bit shallow. The Courseware of this course is short on code examples and exercises. If this is your first programming course, read the provided textbook. Exercises should be done in the Oz programming language. Oz is exotic. I recommend you to read the part of the textbook on its syntax and semantics. Thus you avoid frustration. And the semantics of Oz studied here will be used in “Abstraction and Concurrency.” So this course really is required for “Abstraction and Concurrency.”</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69240</course_id><course_title>Paradigms of Computer Programming – Fundamentals </course_title><school>School:  Université catholique de Louvain</school><review_data_id>115172</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-11-05</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course introduces functional programming as a first step towards several other paradigms (in Lov1.2). In the way it explains several other things like data structures (lists, trees and records), formal semantics and complexity of programs. It does a very good job in explaining a lot of abstract concepts to people with few programminv experience. The language used is Mozart-Oz, a research language that implements in a clear way all the explained concepts. The exercises of the course are of two kinds: multiple choice or fill the gap ones to test if you understand the theory and practice exercises in Oz, graded by an automatic grader. These programming exercises are very interesting and the real test for knowing if you have learned how to apply the theory to real programming. All in all, I strongly recommend the course, as it has been an open-minder course for me. I'm sure that you will enjoy it if you really like programming.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>51348</course_id><course_title>Italian Language and Culture: Beginner</course_title><school>School:  Wellesley College</school><review_data_id>123896</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Patricia Frances Sandler</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-08-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I have been studying Italian for about 25 years using various books, tapes and other educational material that I had found through Italian cultural groups and through the Internet. When I received the link to this course from an Italian acquaintance of mine, I was a little hesitant to start as I have not taken any tests or attended a formal course for years. However, I must say that this was fantastic. I completed the advanced course with a verified certificate and pieni voti, and now, I am using the audit function to review the intermediate course. Even though I am a commensurate self-directed student, the tips that Prof. Bartolesi-Graf gave were extremely helpful. Also, interacting with other students by posting on their discussion threads was really great. Sometimes, you can feel a little lonely studying "da sola." I have recommended the course to other friends in my various Italian groups. I would like to see a course like this for people who are planning to work in Italy. This would be very enjoyable to follow, and there would be a lot of important vocabulary words.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>51348</course_id><course_title>Italian Language and Culture: Beginner</course_title><school>School:  Wellesley College</school><review_data_id>123396</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-08-03</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>I wasn't really satisfied with the course. I took it just to see what my level of Italian was (I wish there was a test before the first lesson in order to check that, not to have to take the whole course!). But I found that many lessons were repeating over and over again, so I lost interest pretty quickly. Too much things crammed in a lesson, too much things on the course pages, too much clicking all the time. I also didn't like the main stories of each lesson, I found the girls annoying and irritating. The professor is a nice lady, she really tries and is very patient, so I have nothing bad to say about her. It's the course I didn't like. It's like an old-school course from the 1980s.

Being able to follow every detail of the presented content can be challenging, dividing it into three modules makes it more doable, but you really need to complete all three modules to get a complete view of the subject.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>47764</course_id><course_title>Birds 101: Introduction to Pet Birds</course_title><school>School:  University of Tennessee</school><review_data_id>121995</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Gabs B.</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-06-18</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>This course really taught me a lot. I got hooked on the last two topics, and just loved the videos of Professor Souza and the vet technician working with the birds and explaining step by step how procedures are done. Some areas were vague but this is the part where the student has to go to outsources to learn specifics. I would and have recommended this awesome course to others!

It is an excellent summary of the criminal justice process. It goes beyond the psychology to provide an informed analysis of all the key steps within the criminal justice system for prosecuting crimes. The tools this course uses to allow the learner to participate as well as the grading system are superb. My hat goes off to the team for the excellent job done in putting together this valuable course. I would recommend this course to everyone to learn how the criminal justice system works and its weaknesses. This course should be provided to all high school students before graduation so they can see how the system works to investigate and punish crime for their benefit and the challenges the system faces.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>67560</course_id><course_title>Christianisme et philosophie dans l’Antiquité </course_title><school>School:  Sorbonne University System</school><review_data_id>122606</review_data_id><reviewer_name>student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-07-08</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Grande clarté des explications, informations structurées avec une progression logique.

I have always enjoyed creating and giving presentations, but Matt had me completely rethink the way I structure and deliver public speeches. This course covers everything from short impromptu speeches (e.g. presenting in a meeting) all the way to full on persuasive speeches that can be delivered in a formal setting. Topics discussed include brainstorming and structuring presentations, creating and countering arguments, rhetoric, and the actual performance. You can do three optional homework assignments, which are basically filming yourself giving a speech. On these you will get feedback from two of your peers. Doing the homework helped me a lot, however the feedback I received was completely useless. But that's just about the only negative thing I can say about this otherwise awesome course.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>46951</course_id><course_title>Philosophy and Critical Thinking</course_title><school>School:  The University of Queensland</school><review_data_id>123673</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-08-10</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I did not require Philosophy for my bachelor's degree, and have regretted not taking it.

I would like to amend my review. As evidenced by the comments accompanying my original review, the course material was excellent and comprehensive. The instructors were knowledgeable, engaging, and very responsive to learner questions. The provider, edX was wonderful. My only negative comment is that it took me much longer than the 3-4 hours a week to complete the course, but it was well worth it.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>47008</course_id><course_title>How to Write a Novel: Writing the Draft</course_title><school>School:  University of British Columbia</school><review_data_id>122663</review_data_id><reviewer_name>JF Beningson</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-07-11</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I am a repeat student, with course 1 and now course 2 under my belt... both excellent! Instructors are so knowledgeable and share openly. EdX platform works great. Search tools for discussion posts could be better (there are lots of discussions in a writers workshop) Given that I still work full time and have a family, I wish the course had more time to complete assignments, especially at the end of the course... it's hard to fit it all in by the deadlines. However, the ability to back and review material will be highly valuable! Definitely take this course and the first one if you want to learn how to get going on a novel.

Through out the course, the professor and staff were very helpful and made the process of learning very easy. After this course I've gone and learned many programming languages and created many apps.

Even if one is not especially interested in data science, the consolidation of the object-oriented programming methods introduced in 6.00.1X will be valuable to someone learning Python. Having taken 6.00.1X and 6.00.2X, the only thing I was left wondering about was whether the problem sets could have been approached differently. Typically in this course, problem sets involve a fair bit of helper code and the student has to fill in the gaps to get everything working. An advantage of this is that it gives you practice at dealing with other peoples' code; an occasional disadvantage is that you may end up having to solve a problem their way only.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>34574</course_id><course_title>Product Design: The Delft Design Approach</course_title><school>School:  Delft University of Technology</school><review_data_id>123870</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Markus Mattern</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-08-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>A great course about product design including a lot of practical parts and following a great story.

Prof Amery is very knowledgeable and has vast experience,one learns with him.The entire tech team was very helpful,being the first course,one did have issues,which were solved in a jiffy. The platform and the learning structure of Edx is suitable for someone who is learning after a gap,a new subject etc. All in all,I did not find anything lacking in my experience of this course- it was a breath of fresh air.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45472</course_id><course_title>Language Revival: Securing the Future of Endangered Languages</course_title><school>School:  University of Adelaide</school><review_data_id>118492</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Alastair Nicholson</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-02-15</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Super Course.....

It was interesting, and really helpfull with my studies. I'm writing my thesis about the ryukyuan endangered languages, and the course provided me the opportunity to take a step back and rethink my research in a bigger, universal scale. The extra material was easy to work with, and well matched with the structure of the weeks. We were able to discuss our opinions not only on Edx's forum, but on the social media as well, and we're able to follow the work of Prof. Zuckermann and his team up to this day.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>34835</course_id><course_title>Visualizing Japan (1850s-1930s): Westernization, Protest, Modernity</course_title><school>School:  Harvard University</school><review_data_id>119491</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Kobayashi Shigeru</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>0</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/feiyuan2</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-03-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Amazing course.

This course is perfect for that purpose. I like the fact that it covers a wide range of areas, from gender to credit! The exercises and homework can be really tough, especially for those new to statistical language and tools like myself. But it's an extremely rewarding component of the course. Just be prepared to spend really 8-12 hours per week for it! The instructors are excellent. They always try to give different ways to explain difficult problems so everyone could follow. I find the class lectures and interaction very engaging. Finally, I hope taking this course will serve me well in my upcoming job search :) and encourage everyone interested in economic development, especially for the poor, to take this course.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45324</course_id><course_title>Understanding the Federal Reserve</course_title><school>School:  NYIF</school><review_data_id>121133</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-05-15</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Excellent course.

My main reasons are: - the content is suited for novices and experts; - the assignments and the final project are authentic and well-designed creating a deep understanding of Ed Techs’ implementation and evaluation processes; - peers feedbacks are a valuable resource of inspiration and growth; - the videos and reading materials are outstanding: field leaders talk about their experiences and we learn how to use/adapt tools to select, implement, and evaluate educational technology initiatives. Summarizing, Professor Klopfer and Elizabeth Huttner-Loan had created an enriching online learning experience for everyone who wants to learn how to work with Ed Techs in different contexts. Thanks to MITx for this opportunity!

It has helped me to re-think about the way I teach, which is good because I was running out of ideas when trying to improve my training sessions. I’ve learnt a lot about EdTech, pros and cons, example of success and failures. I’ve reinforced the idea of the many benefits it provides, but the most important thing I’ve learnt is that although the technology can be great it may not be necessarily good for the goal I’m pursuing. I’ve renewed my passion for teaching and learning as well as my interest in research for better practices. Reading other people experiences, learning for professionals and sharing ideas has refreshed my brain. The MOOC itself is very well structured; videos are great, easy to follow and engaging, with real situation well explained, key concepts developed and to the point. All supporting materials were very interesting as well. I would definitely recommend this course and look forward to learn more in the near future. Thanks MITx team!

As a technologist getting into EdTech, I had not given systematic thought to the process of evaluating technology and that changed significantly. The course videos, readings as well as peer discussions definitely helped shape my thinking on specific aspects related to evaluation to create a more thought out plan. Clear, concise and thought provoking guidance by Professor Eric Klopfer in the course videos and hangouts with a nicely structured program has been organized very well by Elizabeth Huttner-Loan. Insightful perspectives from thought leader speakers, great course reading materials and amazing peer interaction with experienced academic professionals made this a valuable experience.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>14125</course_id><course_title>Agile Development Using Ruby on Rails - Advanced</course_title><school>School:  Berkeley</school><review_data_id>118830</review_data_id><reviewer_name>olivier Esmieu</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-02-27</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>all great.

I don't know if the reason for this change of hearth is my perception changed or not, but between MOOCs I took a course at college regarding this same subject and that helped appreciate the contents of this MOOC. This is not a technical course per-se, but it is (as the name says) much more focused on processes. Don't take this as something negative, on the contrary: it helps you understanding how to build and deploy reliable software. Lectures are great; they're pretty useful while remaining a joy to watch. Even if you are not planning to complete this course (as far as certification is concerned), just watching the lectures is a great head start in developing some necessary skills to build software products. Anyway, bear in mind that to retain all this information you really have to put in practice in real projects, otherwise probably you'll forget everything.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>14125</course_id><course_title>Agile Development Using Ruby on Rails - Advanced</course_title><school>School:  Berkeley</school><review_data_id>61373</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Arash Pourhabibi-Zarandi</reviewer_name><other_review_count>5</other_review_count><other_course_completed>5</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/arashpourhabibizarandi</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-12-24</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review/><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>46962</course_id><course_title>The Book: Book Sleuthing: What 19th-Century Books Can Tell Us About the Rise of the Reading Public?</course_title><school>School:  Harvard University</school><review_data_id>123114</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Nicole Stack</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-07-25</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Would you ever consider doing an online course in gender studies in Victorian Literature?

The videos are well-crafted, succinct, and present the subject matter in an easy-to-understand and digestible manner. The quiz questions are quite challenging. In the main, they focus on conceptual understanding of the presented material, so ensuring a thorough, careful reading of the course material will pay dividends. No questions, IIRC, require any computations. Interestingly, probably about 20% of questions are of the "select-and-drop-in-the-box" type, requiring the selection and placement of answers on a graphic image, or table, something which adds variety to the quiz-completion process. Note the quiz format sees two or three questions accompany each topic, with the bulk of questions reserved for a final quiz. All quiz questions allow a single submission only. IMHO, the course admirably achieves its aim: to provide an introduction to the concepts, issues, and trends underlying Enterprise IT storage infrastructure. Bound to be particularly useful to both new entrants to the field, and decision makers wanting a better technical understanding of the field.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>65205</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Data Storage and Management Technologies</course_title><school>School:  IEEE</school><review_data_id>120714</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Cristóbal Morocho</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-04-27</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>An excellent introduction to the subject of Storage , Back -up and Cloud Technologies ; this will be very useful for managers of IT infrastructure.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>65205</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Data Storage and Management Technologies</course_title><school>School:  IEEE</school><review_data_id>120712</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Abdul Gaffar Syed</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-04-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Very nice introduction to Storage, Back-up and Cloud Technologies.

Content is digested without becoming superficial and the course is continually presented in an engaging manner. I had no real exposure to China before the course, despite business trips to both Beijing and Shanghai (both of which were spent inside conference rooms!). The course's design, content and importantly the instructor's presentations do not presume any prior exposure to China or its history. This allowed an only moderately interested participant like me to feel OK and welcomed. And, I should add, eventually captivated by the course and by the reality and complexity of China as a nation, polity and people. I am now reading my fifth book on China. This would never had happened had I not taken this fabulous course!!</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>35757</course_id><course_title>China (Part 2): The Creation and End of Centralized Empire</course_title><school>School:  Harvard University</school><review_data_id>61134</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Paul Hundal</reviewer_name><other_review_count>124</other_review_count><other_course_completed>109</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/paulhundal1</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-12-07</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Course is full of great information and well organized. Learned more than I expected. I recommend you take the first China course in this series (SW12x) before this one because the first course provides a broad look at the starting point of Chinese history that provides a base for this second course. The historical period covered by this part (300 BCE to 450 AD) builds directly off the base outlined in the first part.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>35757</course_id><course_title>China (Part 2): The Creation and End of Centralized Empire</course_title><school>School:  Harvard University</school><review_data_id>54157</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Ann Schmidt</reviewer_name><other_review_count>25</other_review_count><other_course_completed>24</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/annschmidt</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-09-08</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Interesting course, part of the China X series, which goes into detail about the history of China.

There are lots of quizz-like questions during the weeks and participation in discussion forums also is required. At the last week, there is a Final Assessment. * Good points: \- The lessons are well organised, usually following a logical and chronological order. Besides, some interviews were included in this part. \- Professor Bol &#31;- responsible for Part 1 to 6 - exposes subjects very well and Professor Kirby gives goods contributions during classes and debates. \- Some discussions emerged in Office Hours are very fruitful, since the professor and some experienced students can deepen some contents and clarify some questions. \- The whole course is divided in 10 mini-courses, and each part will keep open until the end of the entire course. Thus, flexibility is surely one of the best points of this MOOC. * Bad points: \- The sound still has serious problems: it is very low. \- The obligation of participating in discussions sometimes becomes tiring, especially if you are doing the course after it had finished. * Overall evaluation: This second part of ChinaX covers especially the Qin and Han Dynasties, as well as their main characteristics, such as government, culture, philosophy etc. It was an excellent sequence, brief and deep. I really recommend it for those who want to learn something about this new contemporary power.

Good prepared content was well served by excellent instructors with very interesting topics chosen. But be aware -- this is not a course about "How world should look like" or "What is good or wrong". It is said that this course is in ethics and this is not true at all. This is a purely political course. Saying that this course is about ethics is like saying that what is good for the U.S. is good for the mankind. So, take the course if you are interested in American politics from the American point of view, but don't expect philosophical debate about the world we are living.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45173</course_id><course_title>Central Challenges of American National Security, Strategy, and the Press</course_title><school>School:  Harvard University</school><review_data_id>73846</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Paul Hundal</reviewer_name><other_review_count>124</other_review_count><other_course_completed>109</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/paulhundal1</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-03-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This has been an excellent course. It contained inciteful dialogue of differing views using a point/counterpoint approach by two well versed instructors. It is one of those courses that I strongly recommend every MOOC learner take especially due to its current relevance. It confronts the difficult issues of freedom vs national security when they are in conflict and provides opportunities to work on more in depth analysis where you get case studies to write briefs to the president and others. You don't have to do the case studies so it set up with a very nice flexibility where you can take on a lot or if you don't have time, just watch the videos and discuss on the forum.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>36355</course_id><course_title>Poetry in America: The Poetry of Early New England</course_title><school>School:  Harvard University</school><review_data_id>114791</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Cristian Mendoza Caero</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-10-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>From the perspective of the construction of official history, it is certainly a great truth and lie told by half, poetry was indeed a mirror of the most simple and real things that portrayed America.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>36355</course_id><course_title>Poetry in America: The Poetry of Early New England</course_title><school>School:  Harvard University</school><review_data_id>110661</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Rosalyn Slater</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-07-24</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I took Professor New's courses in all the wrong order but thoroughly enjoyed the whole series. I had taken an online poetry course on Coursera and wanted more Emily Dickinson. From there, I found the other courses offered here. The method of teaching was totally enjoyable and abundantly worthwhile. I enjoyed the different venues. Being at the Concord while discussing the history...so great! I'm reading Richard Slotkin's book, "Regeneration through Violence" at the moment and probably will have to review the course afterwards.

I took the pilot course a year ago and I hope that the new one which is going to start soo will be improved. It was quite difficult to follow Professor's New speech, but subtitles helped. It's not because my difficulties with the language, but because of constant "eh", "ah" and pauses. Although the scientific and informational aspects of the course were perfect. You'll have to work closely with poems and analyze all the details. It's not just reading and discussing poems.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>36355</course_id><course_title>Poetry in America: The Poetry of Early New England</course_title><school>School:  Harvard University</school><review_data_id>50683</review_data_id><reviewer_name>student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-08-15</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I took the pilot version of this course a year ago.

The focus throughout is on theoretical underpinnings and key devices that have emerged from them. The three segments together represent an online version of the residential 3.15 course and were prepared for MIT students. Prof. Ross has generously made them available through edX, but she did not participate in the edX course itself. Instead, course manager Jessica Sandland, a great teacher in her own right, did an excellent job administering homework assignments and exams, answering our questions, and keeping everything on track. Prof. Ross begins with a thorough foundational introduction, and then moves on to applications and devices. This installment of 3.15, which covers semiconductors, is by far the most rigorous of the three and includes an introduction to diodes, transistors, and photovoltaics. Do not get discouraged! Some of the homework assignments and exam questions come as quite a challenge given the easily followed lectures. For me, a textbook was essential. Fortunately, Prof. Chenming Hu has written perhaps the best one out there and offers it free online. Download and read it. When you finish this course, you will *really* understand semiconductors at a deep working level, from quantum states to band structures to electrical behavior.

Professor Blanchard is great, the material is engaging, and the support from the instructor team is first-rate. I went into the course wondering about the level of calculus needed to be successful. I did not find this course to be at all challenging calc wise, requiring simple knowledge of rudimentary differentiation and integration. If anything, the most challenging computation wasn't the calculus, but rather some occasional algebra tap dancing.

One of the best I have ever seen. 1. The course progresses systemically from simple to more complex with comprehensive explanations and examples that illustrate the concept being explained. For me the pace is optimal. 2. Perfect combination of theory, conceptual quizzes, examples to be solved by hand and examples to be solved in MATLAB. 3. Professor has a nice sense of humor and adds jokes where suitable. This makes this course not only valuable, but also enjoyable. My sincere gratitude to prof. Paul Blanchard and his team at Boston University! P.S. I have market the course difficulty as "easy" because if you have no problem differentiating and integrating then this course just teaches you new ways of applying these concepts to solve differential equations.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>27409</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Differential Equations</course_title><school>School:  Boston University</school><review_data_id>119972</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jack Luper</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-03-31</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I took a differential equations years ago and wanted a refresher.

However, be aware that this course represents a narrow perspective of moderate right-wing opinion. Nearly all the "outside" readings are from the Hoover Institution sponsored journal EducationNext where Dr. Peterson is a fellow and editor. The bottom line message of the course is that regulations and teacher unions are the problem and school choice (vouchers, charter schools) is the solution. The course material is honest in that research is presented showing that the proposed innovations in school organization have not proven to produce dramatic improvements. Many alternative opinions not really explored in the course. Beyond grade school reading, writing, and arithmetic is there really a "common core" of knowledge that should be mastered by everyone or is diversity in education tracks (traditional classics-based vs. religion based vs. creativity emphasis vs. practical career focused) a better approach because many different skills are needed in society. Do the current standardized tests used to assess schools really measure important life skills for the 21st century? Most importantly, is the low academic achievement of US students due to broad social factors including poverty, disrupted families, lack of respect for authority, and general anti-intellectualism in the adult population? These are examples of alternatives Dr. Petersen does not really explore.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>36398</course_id><course_title>Saving Schools, Mini-Course 1: History and Politics of U.S. Education</course_title><school>School:  Harvard University</school><review_data_id>67453</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Paul Hundal</reviewer_name><other_review_count>124</other_review_count><other_course_completed>109</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/paulhundal1</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-01-11</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This has been a very informative MOOC on the US education system and how it evolved.

I anticipated learning what the course description set forth and did. The discussions were well-paced for a variety of students, The question and answer format worked particularly well for me -- it served as a mental outline that kept information in place. The conversations with outside experts were informative and interesting and often presented different points of view. Only one thing I can think of -- Dr. Peterson began many of his responses in the question-answer format with "well". Silly but it began to grate. All in all, a really excellent course for anybody interested in education in the United States. I'd like to require the school board members and school administration in our district to take it but that isn't within my power.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>36398</course_id><course_title>Saving Schools, Mini-Course 1: History and Politics of U.S. Education</course_title><school>School:  Harvard University</school><review_data_id>50712</review_data_id><reviewer_name>student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-08-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I would prefer the name of the course would be Saving Schools: From Horace Mann to Virtual Learning, like Professor Paul E.

It was not easy, but possible. Still you have the possibility to get lower qualifications in those lessons that have more contents on physics and maths, as they will not be considered for the final mark. There are many facilities for success and three different assessment tasks: writing essays, participating in forums and answering questionnaires... in fact, you can use materials (additional, if you need) and take your time! I worked a lot, yes, and I also learnt a lot, which was my objective. I can say that my understanding and perspective of science has changed by doing this course and I cannot do other thing that to say thank you to the teaching staff and especially to Professor Galison, who has a natural talent to make that you love physics and history of science. As an aspect to consider, I would say that the required effort is much higher: 10-12 hours per week. This is my invested effort (on average: some weeks more, others less), but I am not English speaker (as mother tongue). Perfect if you are interest on science, arts, culture, history and I would advice to any scientist in any discipline.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>34593</course_id><course_title>The Einstein Revolution</course_title><school>School:  Harvard University</school><review_data_id>71340</review_data_id><reviewer_name>student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-02-22</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>Not a course for anyone without advanced knowledge of physics.

Behavioural medicine isn't an area I've studied before and sounded quite daunting, but the course description persuaded me to enrol and it's been worth it. The idea of it to me is how to make/encourage positive, sustainable change for personal health and wellbeing, dealing with challenges along the way. It's got theory but is essentially a practical mooc which can be for self-reflection and improvement as well as to support others. Assessments are useful not burdensome.

From ground zero. Professor Cvitanic was terrific explaining the first 8 weeks of the course, the final 2 weeks were a bit obscure and ambiguous, I had to resort to my personal experience to do the homeworks and then facing the final exam. CalTech proved why is nowadays America's best STEM college in the world. The educational methods were up to its standards. Unfortunately, this course is not for dummies. If you are a seasoned speculator, a dealer or a trader with a degree in STEM OR BUSINESS you will struggle with some of the challenging questions, but you will pass (even if you are rusty!) One of the features I enjoyed the most in regarding this tough course. It is probably the only MOOC asking you to take an admission test...If you do poorly , you better study the material at once and take a second chance to take the class for the Honors....</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>24076</course_id><course_title>Pricing Options with Mathematical Models</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>118228</review_data_id><reviewer_name>student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-02-06</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I was very happy to take this course.

It was a big disappointment to find out that no certificate of achievement is delivered at the end of the course, even if you passed, as opposed to what the edx platform advises, that all course come with them. You have to pay for the certificate in this case. The course could have been more interesting if a series of lecturers will have intervened along the lessons instead of just one. The debates were interesting on the first four lessons but somehow lack of strength on supporting the debated case on the last two lessons.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>14133</course_id><course_title>Behavioral Economics in Action</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>120109</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Abdou Djibo</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-04-05</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course is very interesting and important, it's so good to teach this kind of course to help fund free education for everyone.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>14133</course_id><course_title>Behavioral Economics in Action</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>119954</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Rafael Pohle</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-03-31</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>A very interesting subject, which is a good completion to "conservative economics studies".

There is a lot of material to go through relative to other MOOCs but it is very solid information and I thought well worth it. The course is well organized, well presented, very thorough and intelligently designed. The grading system was completely fair and even though the final exam is challenging the pass mark is set low so you will pass if you view all the videos. There is lots of time provided to complete the work which is good because the course goes into depth on the key subjects without getting overly technical so its worth taking the time to take it all in.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50001</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Venture Capital: How to Get Money for your Startup</course_title><school>School:  The RWTH Aachen University</school><review_data_id>119850</review_data_id><reviewer_name>efrain tarin</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-03-28</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>It was a great experience, very useful and well delivered information, easy to engage and understand</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50001</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Venture Capital: How to Get Money for your Startup</course_title><school>School:  The RWTH Aachen University</school><review_data_id>119342</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Shaumik Ganguly</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-03-14</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>The overall experience was amazing.

I love that the assignments are left to our imagination, they give us instructions of what to do for each week´s assignment, but do not restrict our creativity, we are free to let our imagination fly. The programming concepts are very well explained and easy to understand.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69964</course_id><course_title>Think.

It's a hands-on experience that covers the basics of control -- i.e., keeping a system operating at a desired setpoint using feedforward and feedback strategies. The course takes a discrete-time approach to avoid differential equations, but the math is still far from trivial, and discrete time is what today's digital controllers use. The first week builds the necessary mathematical foundation of sequences, difference equations and natural frequencies. The second and third weeks get into the meat of control theory, culminating with an exploration of Proportional plus Sum plus Delta (PSD) feedback, the discrete-time equivalent of the well-known Proportional plus Integral plus Derivative (PID) feedback paradigm. Students (reversibly) harvest a propeller arm from an inexpensive drone and combine it with an Arduino controller to create a programmable control system. A series of excellent user interfaces allows you to vary different control parameters and see the effects on the propeller -- does it hold steady, does it oscillate, or does it fly out of control? A terrific simulator ties the math directly to its control effects, allowing you to enter a difference equation and see how well controls an animated helicopter as it changes height. There were no lecture videos in the beta course, but the written materials were so good that I wonder whether lectures are even necessary, and the professors, Jacob White and Joe Steinmeyer, were incredibly dedicated -- fielding innumerable questions, fixing minor glitches, and taking a heroic interest in students' progress and understanding. It's amazing how much we covered in three weeks, though when it was over, many of us were eager for more -- and hopefully, down the road, there will be more.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>70223</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Control System Design - A First Look</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>118087</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Paul Triantafyllou</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-02-01</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course does a good job of balancing theory and application.

The tool for analyzing poetry was greatly improved if compared to the first segment of American Poetry course.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>34742</course_id><course_title>Poetry in America: Whitman</course_title><school>School:  Harvard University</school><review_data_id>33453</review_data_id><reviewer_name>student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-05-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I enjoyed this course so much.

The team of faculty, TAs, and technical folks did a great job creating videos that are both interesting and informative, as well as discussion forums that encouraged discussion and debate among the students. I enrolled in the course knowing very little about the ACA and US health care policy (albeit more than the average American). While this course only scratches the surface, I now feel confident discussing these issues with friends and colleagues, having learned from some of the leaders in the field. There were a few technical glitches in the first round of the course, but I'm confident that these will be worked out with each additional iteration.

As a Canadian with friends and relatives in the US I have often wondered how the US Healthcare system works on the ground. This course answered all my questions. It was a detailed well paced course which helped me understand the evolution of health care in the US and how the Affordable Care Act impacts on it. Some students thought it had a liberal bias but I didn't see that but I also admit I am a liberal. I was surprised by how heavily politicized the provision of health care is state by state with many conservative states refusing to accept federal government paid for benefits for its citizens. When it comes to health care I am extremely grateful to live in Canada.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>34831</course_id><course_title>United States Health Policy </course_title><school>School:  Harvard University</school><review_data_id>30564</review_data_id><reviewer_name>student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-04-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Incredible course with incredible professors!

I liked these courses and the way they were presented as Steve teaches much of the practical components in R (in my case) or Python and Cynthia provides an enthusiastic explanation of the statistical theory behind this. Of all the courses I am doing in the Microsoft data science curriculum these two are courses I might well go back over, just to reinforce the theory behind much of the statistics. I recommend paying close attention in this course and taking good notes as you will find these helpful in later parts of the curriculum especially the final project at the end. One aspect I liked about this course was the assessments which were a combination of comprehension questions and questions that required you to perform actions in R (or Python) to be able to answer--I found this quite satisfying as it reinforced that I was learning and absorbing the material.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69221</course_id><course_title>Principles of Machine Learning</course_title><school>School:  Microsoft</school><review_data_id>123557</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-08-07</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I would say this is a very hard course for me because I have very poor fundamental in math and programming.

I was fascinated to learn about the atmospheric circulation and the ocean circulation on the planet and the importance of them. I also learned about the different "belts" on Earth (I live in the "desert belt" or the "horse latitudes, I discovered) and the prevailing winds. Professor Karny makes the material come alive with his sheer enthusiasm for our planet and there are lots of little exercises and "quirky connections" for students.

This is due to following reasons:- 1.Flow of the course is good, first we are involved in a question after churning our mind for 2-3 minutes or may be even longer we get answer.I think it is best way for learning. 2.I find energy as a central theme in this course quite fascinating, it gave me a different way of looking at things like seasons. I appreciate effort put by the team for this awesome course. I thank you all for the same.

I recommend this course to any one interested in statistical analysis (as an introduction to machine learning, big data, data science, etc.).

I took Prof. Mahometa's part 1 of the course and fell in love with R(with no prior knowledge). This I think can be taken individually but might have a steeper learning curve. The course is designed beautifully with pre-labs, labs and assignments that cement the concepts learned through text and videos. I have been around on Edx since it started and I must say it is hard to find such well designed course and that too for free. I hope Prof. Mahometa design more courses on advanced topics. It will be a treat to learn.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>48835</course_id><course_title>Foundations of Data Analysis - Part 2: Inferential Statistics</course_title><school>School:  The University of Texas at Austin</school><review_data_id>119725</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Bernard Osei Afriyie</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-03-24</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>i think it is about inferential statistics.it will broaden my knowledge on making a good hypothesis and make good judgements,.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69987</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Italian Opera</course_title><school>School:  Dartmouth College</school><review_data_id>119714</review_data_id><reviewer_name>student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-03-23</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Great course!

I would strongly recommend this course right from a no programmer to and experienced program at least once due to its singular structure. It highly concentrates on designing data definition within a problem domain as to not come up with the exact solution in the first go and rather being an incremental approach going backwards and deciding what would work best and redesigning the data definition which is very unique to bsl/asl that the language itself forces the programmer to do so with lot of inline check-expects(unit test) in place. The course seems to be very simple in the initial few weeks and gradually the difficulty level increases towards the end of course as it highly uses linear data structures(lists) and hierarchical(graph, trees) being very practical to be solved as part of your assignment. Having said that learning it under the guidance of Prof Gregor Kiczales is very much worth for your time to be invested in this course.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45510</course_id><course_title>How to Code: Systematic Program Design - Part 3</course_title><school>School:  University of British Columbia</school><review_data_id>121784</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Lau Sandt</reviewer_name><other_review_count>2</other_review_count><other_course_completed>2</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/lau4</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-06-10</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>An excellent course in how to think about programming in a systematic way. Not depending on libraries to do the complicating things. This is not about coding. This is about learning how to program in such a manner that even complicated functions are easily manageable. The program method is an easy step up to the functional programming paradigm. Two noteworthy points. At times explaining the mathematics behind what your doing is going to be helpful. It is of no use to be afraid that your students will walk away from your course if you shy away from the maths. For people interested in webprogramming and design should in my opinion find another course. That would be the second point. A third not so noteworthy point I now know more about Harry Potter than I ever wanted to...

Among them there are a few that deserve without hesitation the highest rate. But if I had to choose only one at the top of them it would be the SPD series. I took it when it was offered on Coursera years ago. The current incarnation is even better, with added materials (accumulators and graphs). The course relies on and takes advantage of the best modern intro to programming I know, the book "How to Design Programs" by Matthias Felleisen et al. and the gigantic project behind. Materials are carefully designed. There are a lot of practice problems of different levels of difficulty for a really step-by-step learning. The professor and TAs constantly monitor the forums even though the course is now self-paced. No, it is not based on a general purpose programming language like Java or Python, but on a subset of teaching languages created on top of Racket (a descendant of Scheme with many enhancements). The idea is to focus just on concepts freeing students from language particularities and gory details. Don't worry, these teaching languages can be learnt in a couple of hours at most, and everything taught on them is applicable to any real language once one grasp the whole picture. In this regard I believe that SPD is a course to be completed entirely up to SPD3. Although this is not an easy course at all, it is perfectly doable even for total beginners if they put the effort required. If you really want to learn to program well, even if you are a programmer and want to see how a systematic way of tackling problems can help to get correct, elegant, readable and maintainable code, SPD is the best course you can take. If apart from that you are fond of functional programming you'll fall in love with SPD for sure. After SPD you'll never have the blank-page syndrome nor you'll consider those beautiful programs you may have seen sometimes the achievement of incredible wizards. It's all about systematically approaching problems, and there is actually such a systematic way of doing so.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45510</course_id><course_title>How to Code: Systematic Program Design - Part 3</course_title><school>School:  University of British Columbia</school><review_data_id>114273</review_data_id><reviewer_name>H.

I must say, I was not disappointed. Note this course targets software development and maintenance practitioners, but would also be of benefit to others, including those with a stake in the software development / maintenance process, as well as those eager to learn more of this area, since the course provides a clear outline of its essential concepts and practices. The course boasts quality videos that are short, focused, and energetically presented, really bringing the subject matter to life. A particular bonus is that the videos do not simply rehash the textual course content, but include keen insights and useful advice about practical aspects. Well worth viewing. Short and focused also applies to the textual content: bullet-point summaries which outline the essentials, a very suitable approach, IMHO, for this type of subject matter. They provide a very suitable starting point for undertaking further reading, and research. Quizzes are quite straightforward, serving more as a learning aids than as thoroughgoing assessments. The exercises (there was one for each module - four in all) each involving the creation of a 150 to 700 word summary of the concepts outlined in that module. Completing each one does require some commitment, but for helping to better understand the content, were well worth the effort. A highlight was the inclusion of hands-on labs, mostly using the Visual Studio Team Services. They not only offered the opportunity for a more practical glimpse into this area, but were particularly useful, too, in serving to reinforce each module's content. Other practical content included an optional lab using git, a version control system. The accompanying discussion provided a very insightful description of how a key DevOps concept, Continuous Integration, could be fairly easily implemented, highlighting perhaps, that the adoption of DevOps is not beyond the reach of even smaller organisations. The Discussion Forum was reasonably lively, and acted as another source of useful advice as the more experienced participants offered glimpses into how they, and their organisations, implemented DevOps, or, if not fully, some of its core ideas. Also, the Discussion Forum was closely monitored by staff, and such things as minor technical issues were handled promptly, and quite satisfactorily. In short, another outstanding offering from Microsoft and EdX, the two making for a powerhouse combination in the delivery of short, practical, industry-relevant courses.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>68081</course_id><course_title>Big Data for Smart Cities</course_title><school>School:  IEEE</school><review_data_id>121627</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Anthony Borla</reviewer_name><other_review_count>7</other_review_count><other_course_completed>7</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/anthony.j.borla</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-06-03</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Although the course is called "Big Data for Smart Cities", little course time (in fact, only one section in Module 4) is devoted to the application of big data to the smart city application domain. So anyone expecting a deep treatment of this area will be disappointed. That said, the course is a very thorough, and quite approachable introduction to "Big Data", one particularly suited to those with a limited technical background, but wanting a broad understanding of the concepts and technologies used in the field. For example, all the fundamental concepts are presented, and straightforwardly explained, right from data science basics, to distributed databases, the mapreduce programming model, and the various frameworks in common use based on these ideas. The quizzes are not onerous, but do require that close attention be paid to the course material, and focus on testing conceptual understanding, rather than requiring any problem solving. All in all, a very competent introductory course, well suited to a minimally-technical audience wanting a broad understanding of this field.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>68081</course_id><course_title>Big Data for Smart Cities</course_title><school>School:  IEEE</school><review_data_id>121460</review_data_id><reviewer_name/><other_review_count>4</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/ericdocode</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-05-29</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>The course serves as a great survey of the Big Data landscape. The course's videos are very easy to digest and make tough concepts like distributed systems, data nodes and task scheduling much more manageable. The readings are also very enriching and to-the-point. The quizzes are not trivial, but manageable because one needs to understand the lectures and readings to do the quizzes. However, this course really lacks practical assignments or exercises. For instance, the assignments can provide more than knowledge checking by having some toy examples or exercises. I highly recommend this course for someone who looks to understand the concepts of Big Data from a conceptual point of view. However, you should not expect to learn technical skills and applications of Big Data in this course. That said, if future iterations of this course introduces some programming or code-writing assignments, it'll be extremely awesome because the structure of the course has been very well-designed so far.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>68081</course_id><course_title>Big Data for Smart Cities</course_title><school>School:  IEEE</school><review_data_id>121419</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Waseem Parkar</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-05-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Good introductory course.

This course was originally 8 weeks, but edX split it up into two parts, one covering the time domain and one addressing the frequency domain. Major course topics include signal properties, signals as vectors, linear time-invariant systems and convolution. The course requires some linear algebra and calculus (it has a pre-course assessment) as well as some basic programming in MATLAB. You don't need to know any MATLAB going in, but if you do you can skip the tutorial. Grading is based on a combination of comprehension questions, homework quizzes, peer graded free responses and a final exam. All of the course content other than assignments is available immediately so you can work ahead if you want to. Discrete Time Signals and Systems started around the same time as a similar signal processing course on Coursera called "Digital Signal Processing." I found Discrete Time Signals to be much more approachable than the Coursera course; it introduces concepts at a steady but manageable pace and doesn't overload you with math right out of the gate. The course isn't easy, but it isn't too difficult. The lecture videos are well-done and the instruction is very good, although some videos could stand to be broken up into multiple parts. Professor Baraniuk tends to stutter, but it didn't really bother me or detract from the quality of the instruction. The MATLAB programming questions are baked right into the edX website and let you get some hands-on experience with the concepts. The final exam is "closed book" which I think is a mistake as it promotes guessing over learning. All in all, Discrete Time Signals and Systems Part 1 is an excellent introduction to signal processing that is likely to be more accessible than other courses on the same subject you may find elsewhere. The stage is set for a deeper dive into signal processing in Part 2.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>41388</course_id><course_title>Discrete Time Signals and Systems, Part 1: Time Domain</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>69387</review_data_id><reviewer_name>student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-01-31</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>DSP is beautiful.

I specially liked the first parts about what is Csr. The other chapters being focused on how to communicate on it. The final assessment is interesting too. I think the Csr topic is so important nowadays that it should really be studied. The reason why I removed one star is for a little lack of variations in the videos.

Whereas the matter of instructor, I am not aware of her, but the step she is gonna take, imparting knowledge/education about CSR, is appreciable.

The teaching style is formal and rigorous, the course is a little fast-paced and topics complex but it is worth the effort. It starts with the usual cell membrane introduction, and continue with layers of complexity up to optogenetics! It's not declared, neither in the title nor in the course description, but in my opinion it seems that all the introductory sections are wisely oriented to lead students to be able to fully understand optogenetics. One of the best neuroscience introductory course, THE best MOOC about optogenetics.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>36477</course_id><course_title>Cellular Mechanisms of Brain Function</course_title><school>School:  École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</school><review_data_id>115171</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-11-05</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Amazing course, covers a wide range of information going from biomolecular, electrical and biochemical basis of neuronal function, to broader terms like behavior, sensorimotor response, learning and neurological diseases.

Thank you edX for hosting and offering it. I love the demos, labs, the sandbox and the discussions. The guidance explanations in the discussion by all, and especially by one Grove, are very enlightening, many thanks to him. The power of simulation has been made abundantly clear to me. The flexibility of the course is invaluable given that I have a day job and can only commit the portions of time when I am tired to work through the challenging yet accessible content. The opportunity to invest through registering for verifiable certification was very motivating for the the basic and intermediate course. Many misconceptions have been cleared as a result of taking this program. Alas the misconceptions cost me some grade points on my final exams but I cannot reverse what the limited four responses of the final exam dictated even though I later figured out my errors as I worked through other problems. I wish that there would be a 'history-of-submissions' tab besides problems so that I can quickly see the earlier responses and not resubmit them when I cannot access my large sheaf of notes and scratch paper. The exam problems appear to be a notch ahead of what is taught in the course videos and given in the coursebook. The consequence is that I have ended up reading and researching far and above what is required to solve many problems. For example I learnt more about the shunt peaked amplifier, Laplace Transforms, buck and boost inverters, reading component datasheets, the often-obfuscated R_DS_ON, the many-legged integrated circuit devices, diode protection in inductive circuits, among others practical matters than I knew before. May be that is a blessing in disguise as I am much more exposed than I could have if everything was given on a silver platter. I also have a great collection of materials from researching widely. Still for the sake of validity and reliability in testing it is good to test what has been taught and to let the course participants preview some of what they may face. The inability to directly interface with individual staffs and coursemates is very frustrating. Can that be remedied? I look forward to enrolling for 6.002.3x when it is offered in the future.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69855</course_id><course_title>Circuits and Electronics 2: Amplification, Speed, and Delay</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>119321</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Keshav Gupta</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-03-13</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The second part of the 6.002x is a really interesting course.

Motiva saber cuál es la posición del BID con relación a la inversión privada y la responsabilidad social empresarial, por ejemplo. También espero conocer qué posición se maneja con respecto a la baja productividad de esta parte del mundo, asociada para mí a la baja educación y poca responsabilidad de los gobernantes para hacerla más competitiva y liberadora. En fin, es una buena oportunidad de confrontar lo más reciente de la investigación de uno de los organismos financieros puntales del liberalismo para esta región.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45454</course_id><course_title>Realidad Macroeconómica Latinoamericana | The Macroeconomic Reality of Latin America</course_title><school>School:  Inter-American Development Bank</school><review_data_id>122974</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Arturo Salazat</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-07-21</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Tomare el curso por su aportacion bibliogtafica a la materia actualmente en curso de macroeconomia en latinoamerica y que me pueda ser de ayuda amí superacion personal</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45454</course_id><course_title>Realidad Macroeconómica Latinoamericana | The Macroeconomic Reality of Latin America</course_title><school>School:  Inter-American Development Bank</school><review_data_id>122950</review_data_id><reviewer_name>aguilar aguirre</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-07-21</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>me encantaría pertenecer aun esta plataforma para estar mas al pendiente globalmente de gente con talento y de academias dedicadas a una mejor estructura social y cultural que nos puede brindar edx</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>47057</course_id><course_title>Mechanical Behavior of Materials, Part 2: Stress Transformations, Beams, Columns, and Cellular Solids</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>115461</review_data_id><reviewer_name>student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-11-12</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>As I said in relation to the previous course of this series of three, Prof Gibson is an excellent lecturer, the contents of the course are very interesting and well organized, homework and quiz are balanced and helpful, and the staff is very attentive.

L. J. Gibson manages to get you through a somewhat difficult and complex subject, and in the end not only you learn many new ideas but also have fun learning them. I am still not convinced that an online course needs to feel as if you are sitting in classroom while the professor teaches and writes on the board. But I do believe that L. J. Gibson and her energetic and active way of teaching encourages you to learn and get the most from her classes. Again, I have to say that homework were perfectly chosen and let you to have deeper understanding of the course material while you work through them. Finally I would like to thank EDX, MITX and especially L. J. Gibson for this great course.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>47766</course_id><course_title>The Next Generation of Infrastructure</course_title><school>School:  Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)</school><review_data_id>120575</review_data_id><reviewer_name>David Calton</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-04-21</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Awesome, did not know it was possible to study this important topic.

Moreover, financial strategies need to be exhibited such as Public-Private-Partnerships (PPPs), evaluation and high-level decision-making.

The focus was on graphing phase planes and translating various data points on them into real-life conditions. I found the course to be too heavy on the visualization and would have liked more mathematical theory and delving into techniques for solving nonlinear differential equations on paper. However, the instructor did a good job given the time constraints and scope - to delve any deeper and not sacrifice the quality of the course would require more time. I would have liked to see more "real world" applications - the glider equation is nice, but how do engineers who design gliders use them? Why is the double pendulum important and how does it apply to real life? How do mathematicians, physicists, and engineers use phase planes for their jobs?</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>51352</course_id><course_title>The Conscious Mind - A Philosophical Road Trip </course_title><school>School:  Trinity College</school><review_data_id>119579</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Fernando Ferraz</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-03-20</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>A lot of knowledge and insight about our enviroment, self and others.

There weren't quite enough exercises for my likes , although what there was was sufficient for me to pass the midterm with 100% , yet i feel that i need a better mathematics background .</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>34841</course_id><course_title>Waves &amp; Optics</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>115683</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Claudio Felicioli</reviewer_name><other_review_count>58</other_review_count><other_course_completed>58</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/claudio8</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Jason Hafner is really a great instructor, master of interleaving the most complex math concepts with funny breaks. The content is well structured and very deep, helping students to learn both low and high level concepts. The experiments are fun and memorable.

The instructors make us aware that environmental issues is currently a hot topic but it has many challenges along the way. The best we can do is be more sustainable in our choices at home at work and whatever political philosophy we uphold. I like doing the course and found it rather challenging although i began by thinking i would immediately ace the course. I have learnt a lot and it will help me in the future by being more aware of my surroundings and the choices i make when i go to the market etc. Thank you very much for making a Mooc otherwise to get this information is very hard. I like education being at ones finger tips where one can learn at ones own pace in the convienience of ones own home. Whether I pass or fail is irrelevant as I know the info i recieved will help me as i have downloaded the lectures and have a print out of it and refer to it at any time. It will help me in my daily life. I realised that a lot of magazines and websites I get emails from talk about sustainable development and India is on a digital path. I feel happy to be part of the future too.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69545</course_id><course_title>Sustainability in Everyday Life</course_title><school>School:  Chalmers University of Technology</school><review_data_id>110223</review_data_id><reviewer_name/><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>0</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/jjapan2011</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-07-01</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>yes</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45511</course_id><course_title>Découvrir l'anthropologie</course_title><school>School:  Université catholique de Louvain</school><review_data_id>117926</review_data_id><reviewer_name>My Name</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-01-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Great introduction to the anthropological discipline and overview of its methods, approches and relevant theories, thank you</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45511</course_id><course_title>Découvrir l'anthropologie</course_title><school>School:  Université catholique de Louvain</school><review_data_id>114473</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Darleden Albergaria</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-10-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Je suis vraiment heureuse de participer de tel opportunité.

This is an awesome introduction to linear motion. The material is presented in lecture style videos and accompanied by videos related to homework type problems. The material is presented clearly and precisely with little need to refer to the free online text or other outside sources. Homework is slightly challenging but definitely reinforces the concepts presented in the videos. The unit labs present an opportunity to take measurements, make adjustments, apply recently learned material and solve problems in an interactive online environment. The course is geared toward high school students or as an introductory college level course. Professor Hafnor and his “accomplices” really try to make physics fun. They seem interested in the material and their students. They were accessible and didn’t feel like they were thousands of miles (kilometers) away. Overall I would give this course an “A”. If they fix a few inconsistencies, microseconds vs. milliseconds and a few glitches and add one more stupid physics trick, this course would absolutely receive an “A+”.

The three parts of this material provide an extremely good approach to the theory of Quantum Mechanics. The notes for the courses are very precise and it is impossible to find a single typo. Some of the exercises are hard to solve. Exams are somewhat easier. In my opinion these courses would improve a lot by providing some examples of applications and some more intuitive additional comments in selected places.

The three parts of this material provide an extremely good approach to the theory of Quantum Mechanics. The notes for the courses are very precise and it is impossible to find a single typo (or nearly so). Some of the exercises are hard to solve. Exams are somewhat easier. In my opinion these courses would benefit a lot by providing some examples of applications and some more intuitive additional comments in selected places. Although not in MITx, I would recommend to consider taking Utokyo003 about Quantum Mechanics of Molecular Structures, which provides very interesting examples of application of Quantum Mechanics to determine and explain shape, dimensions, and other properties of molecules.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>51483</course_id><course_title>Mastering Quantum Mechanics Part 1: Wave Mechanics</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>118328</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Mark Weitzman</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-02-09</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I was a CTA (community teaching assistant) for the course when first offered, and will be back in a limited capacity for the new run. This course was taught by an excellent lecturer, the notes provided (over 400 pages for the whole course) were in many ways superior to the usual quantum mechanics textbooks, and covered many topics that are usually not emphasized. The problems/exercises were challenging, and constituted both a good review of the material, as well as an excellent way for gaining calculation skills both in quantum mechanics and in theoretical physics. Even as Caltech alumni I highly recommend this MIT course.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>48080</course_id><course_title>À la découverte du théâtre classique français – Tome 1</course_title><school>School:  Sorbonne University System</school><review_data_id>117969</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Monica Guimaraes</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-01-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Excellent course!

The course material regarding Plasticity was completely new to me. But again Prof. Gibson gives the lectures in her own energetic way. Although, I still don’t know why the team from MITX do not use the EDX platform especially for the Homework and Exams. It is still the same idea as sitting in a class and listening to lectures. But I have to say the lectures were amazing. In this part the homework were not really a challenge that needed hard work. It was understandable though, because the whole part on Plasticity covers such vast topics that it is not possible to get into detail in each part and try to challenge the students with conceptual questions. But the course material covers great topics in such a way that I couldn’t wait for the next week and the new lessons. Prof. Gibson, MITX and all you guys on EDX, thank you for this great course.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>51368</course_id><course_title>Mastering Quantum Mechanics Part 3: Entanglement and Angular Momentum</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>120921</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Eduardo Maldonado</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-05-06</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Although I'm not a regular student looking for a special certification,of course I would like to get one, but that is not my goal: I'm too old (86)...

Superficial fields like CS don't get a student's feet wet with things outside keyhole programming and hacking.

I learned how to read and write it and also to speak it very well. However, I've always had some questions that even the excellent books from Perugia could not answer. That's why I took this course, because I want to take CELI, and because I had a fear of taking tests. This course was the answer to my prayers. I will continue to use the excellent explanations give by Prof. Bartalesi-Graf, alias Prof. Milani. I think that students of Italian at all levels can profit by following the course and using the self-correcting lessons to increase their competency and confidence. I plan on reviewing the Intermediate and Beginner sections so that I'll be able to listen to Prof. Bartalesi-Graf's explanations and tips.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>51347</course_id><course_title>Italian Language and Culture: Advanced</course_title><school>School:  Wellesley College</school><review_data_id>121665</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jörg Kowalski</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-06-05</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is part 3 of an excellent course teaching Italian. After having completed parts 1 and 2, no question that I would also do this third part. Within not even 3 months I've learnt Italian, so that I'm now able to read many, partially difficult texts concerning different topics. The course contains plenty of rather useful videos presenting interviews with Italians of origin who talk about politics and Italian culture, arts, music etc. You can get really a good idea of how Italians live, how do they think, which are the current problems economically, socially, learn about the history of Italy and more, diversified and interesting clips and, what's most important as being integrated in a language course, they are well understandable as they present different facets of pronunciation. You can follow the content which matches the grammatical problems of each lession and see how they are implemented into the spoken language. All exercises are diversified as well, so that it is not a boaring task, on the contrary it makes fun and you can engross the thoughts very effectively. Each lession starts with an optimal grammar explanation and then is followed by several clips in which all grammatical problems are introduced, step by step, in a very clearly structured way, as if you are sitting in a classroom and listening to the teacher. Don't ask me how many times I've listened to them, only to internalize the Italian voice, pronunciation, syntax, to get the feeling for the grammar by listening to all useful examples. Last but not least, the support, i. e. the communication in case of questions, either according to language or technical problems is really remarkable! I've got some experiences in learning online foreign languages, but none of the till now finished ones made me feel so far the author's sensitivity while having prepared the course material for those details which learners really must get aware of. For me this one is not only an excellent course but the very best I've ever done! It should serve as an example for effective teaching of other languages. This course must be recommended!

Attending this course you will learn about human origins and evolution (and about paleoanthropology itself) from different points of view of different disciplines. Be prepared to study for months teeth and skulls :) At the end, you will gain the unusual, probably useless, skill to immediately recognized human bones structures and classify them based on their evolutionary age of development. Very interestingly cases of the first evidence of several human social behavior are discussed.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>14146</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Human Evolution</course_title><school>School:  Wellesley College</school><review_data_id>116304</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jo Kelly</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-12-01</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I really enjoyed this course and am very sad it's over. I was extremely impressed by the composition of the lectures, readings, questions, discussions, etc. I have a PhD in biology and numerous other qualifications in areas like business studies. I have also taken a range of other MOOCs. I can honestly say this is just about the most well constructed course I've ever studied and Prof Van Arsdale should be congratulated. Moreover, I had never heard of Wellesley College before, but I have now! I really hope to see further courses on paleoanthropology taught by Prof Van Arsdale in future. He is a consumate communicator of scientific concepts - engaging, accessible and collaborative. In short, a teacher.

In here you will learn not only about the books that the clergy used for the Mass or for when they had to travel; but you will also learn about the day office and night office (the Matin) and the books that they had to use in the Office (which was visited around 8 times a day!) to be able to read, sing and pray during the many hours of the day. This course will also teach you a basic plant of a church and about the calendar and the proper of the time, the proper of the saints and the common saint and what they all have in common regarding the books. While I don't know a bit at all about music I was able to understand the explanations of the chapter of Musical Notation and the impact of course that made the improvement created by Guido of Arezzo. Had the pleasure of learning about all these books and what they are and happy to have gain more information for future references in my works.

They have now broken it into three courses which is an excellent idea because the original course was long and time consuming. I loved this course and the instructor was excellent, a pleasure to listen to, clear and concise. The topic has some tragic case studies of inequity in the world that can be upsetting but through knowledge we will hopefully see the seeds of change, I strongly recommend this three course series.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69861</course_id><course_title>Finance for Everyone: Smart Tools for Decision-Making</course_title><school>School:  The University of Michigan</school><review_data_id>122351</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Daniel Kimwanga</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-06-30</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>he is a smart minded, I think am going to be fitted his faculty, that why am very interested to take the course.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>34456</course_id><course_title>Bases Matemáticas: Integrales</course_title><school>School:  Universitat Politècnica de Valencia</school><review_data_id>121586</review_data_id><reviewer_name>unathi nkenkce</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-06-01</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>THAT IS VERY WELL AM GLAD WE HAVE THIS KIND COURSES BECAUSE IS QUITE HELPING A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THE I WILL LOVE BE HELPED ALSO THANK YOU</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>65184</course_id><course_title>Foundations of Data Structures</course_title><school>School:  IITBombay</school><review_data_id>122832</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Keshav Gupta</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-07-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course content introduces various types of data structures. It also explains to use appropriate data structures for representing, organizing, and manipulating data and to create data structures using basic programming. The course teaches advanced concepts, compared to what I learnt in school, and is not that easy, if not hard. A must do course. In fact, I would recommend to take all the courses of this X-Series "Fundamentals of Computer Science" in sequence.

It is our intention that the book and these notes be able to support both traditional lecture-style courses and those based mainly on project work. In either case we strongly recommend that students be given the opportunity to do some practical work, both in experimenting with and evaluating existing available systems and in designing their own interfaces. HCI cannot be taught exclusively through lectures and books and requires some “hands-on” experience. These notes offer examples of the types of project that can be used to provide such experience.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50068</course_id><course_title>Tsunamis and Storm Surges: Introduction to Coastal Disasters</course_title><school>School:  Waseda University</school><review_data_id>119132</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Minoru Kamoto</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-03-07</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is first time for me to try e-learning course.

Even I live and work in Tokyo area, these are almost new information for me. It was good occasion to write in English logically. I was enjoyed it with challenging feeling.

The content was understandable and it was a pleasure to take this class.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>34824</course_id><course_title>"Dubliners" by Joyce: BerkeleyX Book Club</course_title><school>School:  Berkeley</school><review_data_id>118624</review_data_id><reviewer_name>William Giovinazzo</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-02-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Absolutely enjoyed this class.

The course was curated for the first time, and I would like to praise the commendable work done by the course providers. I enjoyed the guest lectures, the guests were well known media personalities with extensive media knowledge, it was a great experience knowing how they deal and think about contemporary media issues. Professor Dan's lectures were quite useful and he always presents the topics covered in this course with suitable examples, which indeed is a better way to learn the concepts and analyse them clearly. The weekly blogs were an interesting task, we got the opportunity to analyse the issues we personally find interesting, I would say this task made us actually research and know about our issues in-depth. I highly recommend this course since it is a very good way to understand the media we use particularly the web content and social media. One can learn newer ways of fact finding and detection of faulty or misguiding content. Even if you aren't from a media background this course is helpful. Highly recommended!</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>28052</course_id><course_title>Neuronal Dynamics - Computational Neuroscience of Single Neurons</course_title><school>School:  École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</school><review_data_id>115882</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Claudio Felicioli</reviewer_name><other_review_count>58</other_review_count><other_course_completed>58</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/claudio8</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-11-20</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This very rewarding course is more similar to a PhD course than to a simple university one, or, at least, it is of higher quality.

It assumes some knowledge of linear algebra and statistics including regression. Unlike most MOOCs, which are at the freshman/sophomore level, it's taught at an end-of-undergraduate or beginning graduate level. The lectures of 1st rate, with plenty of concrete examples as well as a bit of the theory and equations. The problem sets of challenging enough so that one really learns the material better through doing them, as opposed to the Johns Hopkins Data Science series, whose material is excellent, but whose problem sets are too easy. Ideally, this course could be studied while reviewing your linear algebra text, and further reading such as "The Elements of Statistical Learning" by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman. My only complaint about this course is that there is not a lot of activity on the Discussion boards. This has been particularly problematic for me, as I am running about 3 weeks behind the lead group of students.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>47003</course_id><course_title>De la granja a la mesa: La seguridad alimentaria en la Unión Europea</course_title><school>School:  Universidad Autónoma de Madrid</school><review_data_id>120992</review_data_id><reviewer_name>John Zaldivar</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>0</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/john131</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-05-09</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>pues me parece muy bien , y me gustaría recibir las clases solo que en español. estoy estudiando actualmente Agronomia y pues me interesa saber mas sobre los trabajos de mi carrera ya que son muchos y este curso me ayudara a saber un poco mas y lo aprovechare lo mas que pueda .</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69207</course_id><course_title>Advancing Learning Through Evidence-Based STEM Teaching</course_title><school>School:  Boston University</school><review_data_id>122409</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Kunjan Rajguru</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-07-03</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Excellent content - course designing is suitable also for diversified background educators.

I am very excited by this interdisciplinary learning experience. I have (virtually) met many interesting people and seen even more interesting projects in making and that was extraordinary and so inspiring! The whole course design is pure genius and just to name a few pluses: - you get access to rich and high quality resources (videos, readings, tools, working groups, live events) - the assignments are well thought through to engage tech and non tech participants - feedback works really well - great structure and vitality of discussion forum - very appreciated freedom to select only activities you most benefit from or enjoy and still succeed (no slacking) - freedom to choose when to work on the assignments (no firm weekly deadlines) - and what is most important for me - you immediately apply everything you learn - you can see yourself getting better and more capable every week - and at the end of it - you have made a game! - and your game is so much better because of this course (comparing to a hypothetical game I would have developed alone .... or no game - more likely outcome without the course) Thank you, Eric, Jason, Scot, Paul and Liz!

The questions were thought provoking and the discussions enabled me to see what other people were thinking about the material as well. Although I disagreed at times with Prof. Ambrosio, he did an great job in guiding us through the material.

It's really a solid introduction to the principles underlying chemical engineering. The instruction is uniformly excellent: the professors present a unit of theory followed by problems they solve step-by-step, and then you're on your own for a graded problem set covering that week's material. There's a final exam at the end. Although any course involving differential equations cannot be categorized as easy, the instructors teach from first principles and anticipate areas of likely confusion. The problems they have chosen for the course are engaging and fun -- thermal baths in Iceland, the Three Gorges Dam in China, painting the Eiffel Tower, the formation of acid rain, and ground contamination due to landfill leaching. Each unit begins with an entertaining video illustrating the subject matter in a practical context. (The visit to a waste-treatment plant is not to be missed.) The staff is incredibly friendly, responsive, and dedicated to students' success. Although all necessary materials are provided, students should consider picking up the recommended textbook (van den Akker - Mudde, "Transport Phenomena – The Art of Balancing"), which is unusually well-written and, like the course, emphasizes interesting problems rather than dry abstractions. This course covers about half of what's in the textbook (which obviously goes into greater depth), and a further MOOC, covering more of the material, is slated for release in Fall 2016.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69203</course_id><course_title>Computation Structures 3: Computer Organization</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>123771</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Xiaohong Deng</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/xiaohongdeng1</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-08-14</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Good as always.

I had user-level experience with Linux, able to do a dual-boot installation and install programms from the official repository. I use Linux Mint, which is quite similar to the Windows layout. I found the course disappointing. It is a mix of different topics, some very basic (filesystem, create directories, set up default programs, where to get help), others more advanced (scripts, networks). But it never goes in depth. I expected to learn commands and tricks to use on a daily basis, like installing programs that are not in the repository, or how to kill a frozen process. I completed the course in a couple of hours with a 97% grade. And I skip some chapters I was not interested in, just searching in the Internet a couple of questions of the final exam, and running Windows 7.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>68064</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Linux</course_title><school>School:  The Linux Foundation</school><review_data_id>123488</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Pankaj Pankaj Dhunagana</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-08-05</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>All is well..

The content of this course is often bamboozling and complex to the public and John (and his team) have done a great job of distilling the information into accessible chunks for people who may not have more than high school science. As a scientist, I got the most benefit from the psychology side of the course. The active participation of the instructors on the discussion pages showed the techniques that could be used to keep discussions about science focused on the science. I would recommend the course to anyone who is interested in the way modern science gets made.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69868</course_id><course_title>Making Sense of Climate Science Denial</course_title><school>School:  The University of Queensland</school><review_data_id>120080</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-04-04</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course drew on specialists in many disciplines, from many countries - all of whom preserved a clear, rational approach and patient demeanor.

Everyone has been subjected to decades of extensive propaganda intended to delay and resist urgent climate action. Unlike other social issues where strong response has been delayed, such as decades of continued tobacco consumption, there's no more time for delay, and dire consequences have already been incurred. Citizens have a responsibility to be well informed and capable of knowledgeably discussing and debating the details for political progress to be made, but the playing field has been slanted by vast sums spent creating doubt and delay. This course is like a rock in David's slingshot, aimed against Goliath, and you know how that ended.

But this course is no where close to the way things are explained clearly . Cynthia is a brilliant as a researcher but very poor in explaining the concepts. I had to google the topics, like Khan academy to see what she is trying to explain. Other than that it was only about how to use Azure by Steve. You have to do the labs just by blindly following the instructions. You have to just copy and paste the code that is provided. No thinking needed at all whatsoever. I dropped out of Machine learning by MS because these reasons.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>47036</course_id><course_title>Data Science and Machine Learning Essentials</course_title><school>School:  Microsoft</school><review_data_id>123628</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Chris Barker</reviewer_name><other_review_count>8</other_review_count><other_course_completed>8</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/chris89</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-08-09</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course is part one of a two-part series of courses in the Microsoft Professional Degree in data science curriculum. I liked these courses and the way they were presented as Steve teaches much of the practical components in R (in my case) or Python and Cynthia provides an enthusiastic explanation of the statistical theory behind this. Of all the courses I am doing in the Microsoft data science curriculum these two are courses I might well go back over, just to reinforce the theory behind much of the statistics. I recommend paying close attention in this course and taking good notes as you will find these helpful in later parts of the curriculum especially the final project at the end. One aspect I liked about this course was the assessments which were a combination of comprehension questions and questions that required you to perform actions in R (or Python) to be able to answer--I found this quite satisfying as it reinforced that I was learning and absorbing the material.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>47036</course_id><course_title>Data Science and Machine Learning Essentials</course_title><school>School:  Microsoft</school><review_data_id>120161</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Pavan R</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-04-08</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I liked Steve's style of teaching but Cynthia is way casual like reading a news script.

I would like to thank you for the great and very professional work that you have put in developing this course, for the quality of your contributions and those of your guests and for your generosity in spreading knowledge worldwide through this MOOC. I want to thank you again for welcoming me warmly at PolyU and especially professor Eric Tsui, Farzad and the team of KMIRC, for giving me further explanation and documents on themes of KM. With your support I was able to convince the director of maintenance and engineering services of my company to the vital interest and utility to launch a knowledge capitalization and management approach, and we’ve just started working on the knowledge audit in this department. I hope you will open another session of this course, so I will come back to share with you and future participants the results of my KM experience within my company. Thank you very much again, and I hope to see you soon.

It just seems the other co-instructor doesn't really say much or do much to help analyze why we are doing something this way. You're best bet is to grab an outside source book on SQL and use that to guide you through what you're doing. I picked one up for about $20 that has the basic SQL lingo and why you do it this way. Taking it again for the 3rd run to get verified. Oh and for those that are new to SQL do the audited version first before getting the verified that way you know what you're up against.

I would recommend this course for anyone wanting to study an introduction to business accounting for whatever reason. I found the five-week format and pace of the course just right. Each weekly topic builds nicely on the previous topic. My main tip is to make the effort to the finish the graded assessments each week (before the start of the next topic). A second tip is that if you find something difficult to grasp, take a break and then repeat the tutorial. Note that week’s 3 to 5 need much more study time than week 1 and 2. A third tip would be to consider investing in the textbook written by the course presenter Professor R. Narayanaswamy. I live and work in the UK, and I find this textbook easier to read and understand; it has more pages of examples and explanations than introductory UK textbooks that I have seen on Amazon UK.

Do a favor to yourself and take Wharton's "Introduction To Financial Accounting", or even Tsinghua's "Financial Analysis".</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>35731</course_id><course_title>Android: Introducción a la Programación</course_title><school>School:  Universitat Politècnica de Valencia</school><review_data_id>120695</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Cristian Campos</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-04-27</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Curso muy bien explicado y detallado en todos los aspectos, es un curso para tener muy en cuenta tanto si eres novato o un usuario más avanzado.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>35731</course_id><course_title>Android: Introducción a la Programación</course_title><school>School:  Universitat Politècnica de Valencia</school><review_data_id>120673</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jose Herrera</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-04-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Un curso super recomendable y encima gratuito, además actualizado... no se le puede pedir más.

It would probably be a good idea to 'raise' the prerequisites. My only criticism is the homework being too easy.

This course is short so it will not take too much of your time and could reasonably be done in parallel with some other courses on edX. The focus on "engineers" is true as the content is tailored to mindsets of most engineers exposed to leadership. This course makes great job of showing the breadth of knowledge, techniques and self-coaching that forms leadership training. It may be short and tries to cover very broad material, but it actually does not feel too shallow and instead provides motivation to research many of the raised issues further either by reading referenced literature or searching for more on your own. Highly recommended if you feel that you may need to work on your communication or managerial skills. One disclaimer though - the course tries to argue very strongly about a rather "political" view on leadership which may feel pushed too much as the "correct" way. If you approach the content in a open-minded view instead of trying to pick on points that you may not agree with, there is a lot to learn even for an engineer who is always deeply involved in a project based work within hierarchical organization.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>48828</course_id><course_title>Leadership for Engineers</course_title><school>School:  Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)</school><review_data_id>118526</review_data_id><reviewer_name>student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-02-16</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>I really liked this course. The team did an excellent job and I thank for that. I know it is difficult to change mindsets but it is time to learn more about this complex world, in which the positivism is always trying to simplify and reduce. That can work for some sciences but leadership goes beyond the purely technical aspects and this course provides the tools to discover your own leadership style. Nevertheless I think it was necessary a sixth week for some specific topics!</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>48828</course_id><course_title>Leadership for Engineers</course_title><school>School:  Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)</school><review_data_id>118149</review_data_id><reviewer_name>student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-02-03</review_date><review_value>5</review_value><review>The course title is "Leadership for Engineers," but I'm not sure there was anything really specific to engineering. It's more like a generic leadership course. The course is relatively short, but there's still some good useful information and skills to learn. I'd say it's worth the time I spent on it, just don't go expecting anything engineering-specific. Or if you're not an engineer, just ignore that "for Engineers" part of the title. This course does have some peer review assessments. There are pros and cons, but for the most part, I do appreciate the fact that someone peers can provide useful feedback and constructive criticism.

I definitely recommend taking this course using Haskell if you want to become a better programmer, before starting a study on another FP language, or using FP features in imperative languages. You will acquire a thorough understanding of FP concepts (as opposed to learning syntactic features), and an appreciation of the simplicity and power of FP.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>34676</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Functional Programming</course_title><school>School:  Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)</school><review_data_id>117499</review_data_id><reviewer_name>student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-01-11</review_date><review_value>5</review_value><review>The first half of the course was easy; the material was really detailed, sometimes even boring. But there were tiny signs in the tests that did not fit to this slow, easy but work-a-lot learning model. For example language elements not discussed in the lessons and questions which just tested how many indirections your mind can handle (or alternatively how good you are in copying and testing the code). But the possibility to check after each question really motivated me to continuously repeat and improve my knowledge. The second half of the course was terrible, they just came up with the monads and without describing it the boring, detailed way, suddenly everything was based on it. I had to search for additional materials and put a lot of extra work to understand the concepts. Maybe it would have been easier if I read the book, but heeeey, I managed to reach near 100% in the tests of first half of the course without any extra effort or reading the book. I was so close to the overall 60% that I only needed to reach a few points in the second half. So the course was unbalanced, period. And if I read the book why would I need the course? This course is not an introduction, and not about functional programming. It is about Haskell, and possibilities of Haskell and creative use of Haskell, but not about understanding the functional paradigm and building a structured solid knowledge. There is hardly any real world application mentioned. If you want to build a compiler or a graphical engine in Haskell and you studied abstract algebra before (I did) then this course is maybe for you.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>34676</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Functional Programming</course_title><school>School:  Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)</school><review_data_id>117327</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Alexey Galiullin</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-01-06</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Great introduction course to functional programming.

This is a great course. I see some comments that it should also teach us how to deploy our own clusters etc. I do not agree. I think it is much more difficult to learn how to properly analyze data than learning technical stuff. Actually, Spark is very easy to set up and run, and if you ever get paid good money for something, it will not be setting up the system, but programming and analyzing. This is similar to setting up Linux: it will not earn you money, but using it will. Once again, GREAT COURSE!

Once you accept and embrace this, the course is wonderful. The lectures are engaging and they tightly dovetail with the recommended (and extremely affordable) textbook. There is a veritable firehose of information and technologies, though. The first two weeks are intro weeks and they should be taken seriously. Students need to learn the background technologies of bash (at least survival skills), git, ruby, and perhaps some basic html/haml/css, though most of these things are touched on during the course. Without any familiarity, recommended commands will appear like magic spells at best and confusing jargon at worst. Pair programming (taking turns coding with another student) is an important part of this class, and while the organizers go to great lengths to make this doable for remote students, the system isn't perfect. So my only real complaint is that this part of the course must be done outside of edX, which introduces a hurtle to completion. Admittedly, building such capabilities into edX would be monumental, but it degrades the quality of the class somewhat nonetheless.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>14123</course_id><course_title>Agile Development Using Ruby on Rails - Basics</course_title><school>School:  Berkeley</school><review_data_id>119813</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-03-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>These and the Machine Learning from Stanford are the best MOOC's I have taken.

The material is straightforward but basic. The instructor is clear and concise. The automated grading of the first Quiz is so horribly broken that I had to drop the course. What's the point; I can't be bothered to wait to fix the course when I could use my time to focus on a much more difficult, thorough, tested, and complete course: MITx 6.00.1x. This course might be suitable for a beginner - next time they run it and fix the grading problems. If you can take a beating and want to learn Python, I suggest punishing yourself with a very serious course: MITx 6.00x.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>66274</course_id><course_title>Nuevas Tendencias en los Tratados Comerciales en América Latina</course_title><school>School:  Inter-American Development Bank</school><review_data_id>120539</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Yesenia Rosas</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-04-20</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>ME AGRADARÍA PARTICIPAR EN ESTE CURSO YA QUE TRABAJO EN ADUANAS PANAMA Y ES DE VITAL IMPORTANCIA APLICAR ESTOS CONOCIMIENTOS EN MI ÁREA LABORAL.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>66274</course_id><course_title>Nuevas Tendencias en los Tratados Comerciales en América Latina</course_title><school>School:  Inter-American Development Bank</school><review_data_id>120812</review_data_id><reviewer_name>PEDRO HENRIQUE GUIMARAES</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-05-02</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Sou Auditor Fiscal da Receita Federal do Brasil, atuando diretamente na área Aduaneira, considero este curso muito importante para todos que atuam no comercio exterior e seu controle.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>66274</course_id><course_title>Nuevas Tendencias en los Tratados Comerciales en América Latina</course_title><school>School:  Inter-American Development Bank</school><review_data_id>120521</review_data_id><reviewer_name>GLORIA INES</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-04-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>ESTOY INTERESADA POR QUE TRABAJO EN ADUANAS DIRECTAMENTE CON LA EXPEDICION DE CERTIFICADOS DE ORIGEN</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>48817</course_id><course_title>Datología: La toma de decisiones basada en datos | Datalogy: Data-driven decision making</course_title><school>School:  Inter-American Development Bank</school><review_data_id>120528</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Alberto Malaga Morales</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-04-19</review_date><review_value>3</review_value><review>Mi mayor espectativa es poder manejarclos datos para poder allar soluciones o tomar desiciones correctas al momento de evaluar un problema</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>48817</course_id><course_title>Datología: La toma de decisiones basada en datos | Datalogy: Data-driven decision making</course_title><school>School:  Inter-American Development Bank</school><review_data_id>118875</review_data_id><reviewer_name>ROBERTO PEREZ ORIHUELA</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-02-28</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>El curso me parece interesante y actual, es importante para un líder la toma de decisiones en la actualidad.

For college credit you must be verified. Under either option, the course is not over simple: college credit should be more than a very fancy receipt. It is advertised as being a hard course - 18 hours a week recommended time commitment - and for those wishing to get full value for money, that is about what it takes. If you want an easy-A, this is not for you. If you want to learn to think about what is involved in writing well, I recommend this course without any reservation at all.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>65178</course_id><course_title>English Composition</course_title><school>School:  Arizona State University</school><review_data_id>119963</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jayne McCormack</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-03-31</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>Dropped after completing week 2. Basically I found it very time-consuming for very little gain. There wasn't enough actual teaching by the tutors for my taste. Having taken two GFA courses before, I’m used to much more video and interactive content instead of reading essay after essay. The discussions boards are an interesting place to hang out but shouldn't be used as a primary place for teaching. I really don't have time to go trawling for relevant information. I wanted knowledge on grammar, on structuring different essays/speeches/etc for different audiences. This course is focused on Ethnography for its large writing projects which isn’t relevant to my goals. Most of the smaller writing journals were about reflecting on a subject, checking the discussion board on what others had written and then writing about that. Other students were providing different point of views and techniques but not the tutors. I'll stick with science-based GFA courses as they seem much better suited to the platform. E.g. They can use exams to check factual learning. Too much of this course is peer assessment and even self-assessment. Reading other students views, work and interacting can be interesting, but shouldn’t be the basis of grading in a university-level course. There's no way to ensure uniformity of grades across the students. One self-confident person may write poorly but give themselves a great mark. Someone with low confidence may do themselves down. As a marking system, it contains a lot of bias.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45189</course_id><course_title>Enhancing Teacher Education Through OER</course_title><school>School:  Open Education Consortium</school><review_data_id>117550</review_data_id><reviewer_name>DR.

This is an advanced multidisciplinary course that will teach you the fundamentals of a relatively new field and also take you to the cutting edge of current research. It seems very much like a graduate university course, with 5 non-trivial but doable assignments, a midterm exam, a peer-reviewed term project, and a final exam. The only major differences with an actual university course is that the term project is peer reviewed, and you have an entire week to do the midterm and the final at your own pace. (For the midterm and final, you can use the class notes and lecture videos, but cannot use any other sources and cannot use the class discussion boards as you might use for the assignments.) The “ideal” student would have knowledge from molecular biology (mainly transcription, translation, chemical reaction rate equations) and electrical engineering (digital circuits, design methodologies, ordinary differential equations). The students fell mainly into one of two groups: molecular biology types and electrical engineering types. I myself fell into the second category. If you do not have any background in either area, you might need to devote much more time than the recommended 8 to 9 hours per week and could have a tough time overall. (I myself ended up devoting probably around 12 hours per week.) I found the assignments very interesting and useful for learning the material. I also found the midterm and final very good. Keep in mind, however, that the problems generally require some thinking even if you know the course content. Matlab is used for some of the problems in the assignments, but it is mainly for running simulations using a program that you are given and have to modify slightly with the specifics of the problem. If you want to succeed in this course, make sure you keep up with the assignments. Also keep in mind that towards the final 6 weeks of the course, you are going to have to do a midterm and a term project, and then get ready for the final exam, so you will be quite busy. Also, it is very important to make good use of the discussion group. You will find a number of students are faced with the same challenges as you so help each other through the problem sets as needed. (Of course, you are never supposed to post answers to the discussion groups, and note that the course staff will monitor the discussion groups for this. Nevertheless, you can help each other by clarifying questions, putting pointers to relevant lecture material, or giving little hints.) I found the very first problem set to be quite difficult but was able to get through it with the help of the discussion group. The later problem sets didn’t seem to be quite as difficult, but they still involved a fair amount of thinking, and I always made use of the discussion groups just the same. I also found the so-called “segment notes” which summarized the content of the videos to be quite helpful. I would normally study the segment notes first, and then watch the videos. One definite glitch with the course was that, due to copyright restrictions, they were not able to post slides from the lectures on the course website. Furthermore, when the slide was shown on the video, some of the text appearing in graphs and diagrams appeared quite small and fuzzy to the point that it could not be read. I hope they fix that issue by the next round of the course. All in all, however, this course was really great despite all the challenges, and I found that the exciting nature of the content will help push you along. If you got an interest in this subject, have at least some of the necessary background, and can put in the time, go for it.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>47762</course_id><course_title>Principles of Synthetic Biology</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>120257</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Aarthi Venugopalan</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-04-12</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>A challenging course but one where solving each problem set gave such a satisfaction as it demanded a good understanding of the concepts and lots of thinking and discussing with the forum. Having been part of the first batch to have taken and completed this course, I can see lots of room for improvement but the course definitely sets a very high standard. From personal experience, having a strong background in molecular biology definitely was a big plus but the lack of knowledge of matlab and mathematical modelling does hinder when attempting the term project which accounts for 15% of the score. Nevertheless one can easily pass the course even without it. The TA was extremely helpful and rectified any mistakes immediately when they were pointed out. The biggest support for this course were the fellow students themselves as the discussion forum is where the concepts and problems were throughly dissected and debated and helped us solve even tricky problems.

I've taken the FA2-MA2 course of ACCA-X and successfully passed both of these subjects with the score for which I can feel proud. I loved the effectiveness of the contents. The way how the lessons are explained were very helpful for me. I could easily understand the topics. The practice questions after every lessons and at the end of the module helped me to strengthen my concept on the paper. Questions are updated with current exam style and very helpful not only to pass but also to obtain very good understanding on the paper which will help the students in their later paper. The discussion section to discussion section to discuss with teacher and learners also helped me a lot. If I couldn't understand any topic I just asked it to the teacher and got my desired answer. I would strongly recommend everyone to take the course. It'll help you to gain better understanding on the paper.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45461</course_id><course_title>Intermediate Financial and Management Accounting </course_title><school>School:  ACCA</school><review_data_id>122005</review_data_id><reviewer_name>khalid yasin</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-06-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Best free e-learning i ever had for accounting,with every aspect of syllabus covered in detail in the content.i have completed my exam and i really think the practice question portion was worth taking.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>3133</course_id><course_title>Fundamentals of Neuroscience Part 1: Electrical Properties of the Neuron</course_title><school>School:  Harvard University</school><review_data_id>117575</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Luis David Fernández Zambrano</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-01-12</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Hello good men starting: Is undoubtedly readable remarkable teaching faculty in the field neuroscientist, the breakthrough of many highly evolved learning techniques introduced virtual training, a wide range of diverse collective political mysteries of ionic and chemical companions inside neuronal unit, the essential role of the different varieties of potential in the transmission of nerve impulses in the species of living things shown on the march '' canon vip '' of science videos result of the work of prestigious guardian, through lectures with great ease assimilative that '' stimulate the activation of a machine very easily sowing dry seeds of doubt in my mind uncertainties in the field of golf, knowingness and animal memory breed .intelectual.-You means- me about grades properties you can get, if we forget the absurd ideas; anti -power '' Put pike in Flanders '' and selecting minds shedding light on different continents in collection staff to dig, find and decipher the mysteries of our bright biological computer.

Videos are truly great. Probably by design, the formal level is not very high compared to an in-class course and several topics have been simplified, but the content is good for an introductory level course. The custom platform used for this MOOC is nice and cool, but not clean and functional as the standard edX platform. Content warning: videos of human cadaver dissection, instructive but not necessary to complete the coursework.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>3133</course_id><course_title>Fundamentals of Neuroscience Part 1: Electrical Properties of the Neuron</course_title><school>School:  Harvard University</school><review_data_id>113870</review_data_id><reviewer_name>student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-10-03</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Please always keeps these courses on self-pace, I need to take the introduction part and the 2nd part as well.

You could get the same detail by watching a handful of leadership and management videos on youtube and surf a few general subject matter websites to find a matching personal development form. Also under edx's new charging scheme I would say this is certainly not worth paying for the $50 certificate.

The problem sets were exceptionally but beautifully challenging, and the instructors pushed me beyond my intellectual capacity many times. By the end of the course my brain was exhausted and "buzzing." However, I now have a much deeper understanding of the state of the art of climate science and this has strengthened my resolve to participate in public discourse concerning our shared atmosphere and global systems. I am very proud to have earned a certificate for this course, and I highly recommend the course for anyone that wishes to dive into the math and physics of climate science.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>14080</course_id><course_title>Global Warming Science</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>35661</review_data_id><reviewer_name>kr strug</reviewer_name><other_review_count>9</other_review_count><other_course_completed>8</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/krzysztofstrug</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-02-04</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Very interesting subject. The pressure is really on the science more then on story telling or political action. Some fluency in mathematics (integrals) is required.

Con respecto al proveedor considero que brindar el curso de forma gratuita es formidable mas sin embargo para obtener el certificado es un poco costoso para algunas personas que no tienen el suficiente presupuesto económicos que habremos muchos que necesitamos aprender y que no logramos pagar, mas sin embargo creo llegar al pago del certificado.

It is excellent. Professor New is also excellent. I did not know a lot about poetry. I learned a lot about Emily Dickinson, who wrote 1,789 poems. She had an unique style of writing. She writes about nature and other things. She did not publish her poems. She said that everyone is a poet. She said that her "wars are laid away in books". One of her poems says: "Who are you? She's nobody. Are you too?"

Absolutely incredible! The time commitment is large, but none of the time was wasted. The course was very well designed and uses the EdX platform beautifully. The labs were very tough, but also very rewarding. Great mix of learning the theory and then applying the theory in the labs. And they are fun too as you see your PacMan move around and eat dots. And very quickly you have designed a PacMan that does much better than most any human ever could. Very nice that they revisit similar problems with newly learned techniques so you can see advantages and disadvantages of each. I could go on and on, but this course is great.

The tools are Matlab, ImageJ, PyMol, the StarMapping genetics simulator, and the Python and R programming languages as used by biologists; and the topics include population modeling, equilibrium kinetics, molecular modeling, genetics, and disease prediction. These diverse topics are taught by an equally diverse ensemble of instructors, both professors and grad students. In some cases, the instructional videos are drawn from other MIT courses, and there are also "faculty perspective" videos that address larger questions in biology. Half of the graded assignments are "workshops" that give you limited answer attempts, and the other half are "exercises" with unlimited attempts. Those familiar with programming in Matlab and Python will find those assignments pretty easy; newcomers will be challenged. But the progressively organized materials assume no prior background and skeleton code is always provided; you're never just thrown into the deep water. What really makes this course are the varied and interesting topics, with no overall organizing principle or constraint, and the quality of the instruction and materials, which are, as is typical for MIT, first-rate.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>29217</course_id><course_title>Quantitative Biology Workshop</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>120247</review_data_id><reviewer_name>student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-04-11</review_date><review_value>1</review_value><review>The examples are not enough explained and all the necessary lines are not explained enough.

An area of improvement would be to provide additional readings or resources to go deeper into the topics. For example, when you spoke about exergy, I had to look for other resources before it was clear that you were talking about how energy is lost in the environment through phase transfers. Additionally, in the simulations unit, I would have been interested to hear in more depth (or potentially given an example) of the simulations used in the the decision making process.

The unique shortcoming is that the course don´t cover the topic of dynamics and the topic of control is treated superficially. Although, the geometric formulacion using for the study of the robot kinematics is stately. The book notes provided in the course, in my opinion, is the best material concerned with the introduction to the diferential geometric tools applied to robotics (in contrast with the gradute-level Murray's book). I think that in the future, the robot analysis and study will be carry out using this moderns techniques, then this course is pioneer in the topic. About the instructor Frank Park, the advanced knolewdge about the topic give him the clarity and patience to teach it. The class in english is totally clear. The TA team for the course aswered several questions in the discussion forum and the forum were very active. In conclusion, a must course in robotic.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>36395</course_id><course_title>Robot Mechanics and Control, Part I</course_title><school>School:  Seoul National University</school><review_data_id>33709</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Dan Brown</reviewer_name><other_review_count>2</other_review_count><other_course_completed>2</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/danbrown</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-05-26</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>I took the course and completed it, with a (barely) passing grade. However, I highly recommend the course, if you can put the time into it. This course is not easy, but is worth the effort. The course is organized as a sequence of topics in robot motion, primarily the issue of expressing the current robot state (position) mathematically. The topics progress from easy (e.g. counting the number of degrees of freedom) to difficult (using matrix algebra to calculate position based on joint angles and link lengths). The professor covers the topics in increasing level of complexity. He explains each concept slowly and carefully in lectures, then when he has explained a topic, he uses the following lecture for a review. In addition, he provides the corresponding chapters of his textbook in PDF. I found that I had to watch the lectures, the reviews, and read the textbook chapters in order to understand each topic. The homework is very well designed, and meshes extremely well with the class material. I always felt as though I was learning the material from doing the homework, I never felt that my time was being wasted. Most homework problems allow many submissions, and worked answers are provided. To learn the material, I found I had to work each problem first myself, which frequently resulted in the wrong answer. Then I would read the worked answer, and see what I had done wrong. Finally, I would work the problem myself, and get the correct answer. The course took much more effort than I had expected. For previous courses, I have been able to watch the lectures and do the homework. In this case, having to read each chapter and work each problem twice added a lot of time each week. For example, as a result, I did not have time to properly work through the final topic, the Denavit-Hardenberg Representation. When it came time for the final exam, I did only enough to be able to pass the course. The class requires a lot of linear algebra on small matricies (up to 4x4), including some tedious symbolic manipulation. I used Sage (the open source symbolic mathematics package, available online) when working on some of the homework, to confirm that my results were correct. In college, I remember the saying that you really learn calculus in physics class. For me, solving the homework on this class taught me the linear algebra that I had previous never quite understood. Even though this class is for an applied subject (robotics), I do not have the feeling after completing part 1 that the material can really be applied. I assume that I will have to complete part 2 to understand how to apply the material. All in all, this class is very worthwhile. Be aware: \- The class is a lot of work. \- The lectures are more variable in length than usual, making it difficult in some cases to schedule when to watch them. I could not decide, for example, to watch the lecture for one topic at a specific time every evening after work, because I could not predict how much lecture time would be required. \- The class seems to be a survey of different representations, I am not certain that they are all equally valuable. If possible, I would have preferred a course with less material (e.g. fewer representations) but more practice with each one.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>36395</course_id><course_title>Robot Mechanics and Control, Part I</course_title><school>School:  Seoul National University</school><review_data_id>31200</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Sagar Sachdeva</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/sagarsachdeva</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-05-11</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Could not complete it due to semester exams but whatever part I did was very well-explained. There was no problem in understanding the accent of the professor. You may have to speed up the video player though. The professor used to first lead us to the common misconceptions and then correct our mistakes, this solidified the concepts. The homework questions were aptly chosen covering the video material. You may consult a book for more questions that is why I have given 8-11 hours per week. In a nutshell, a must course on introductory robotics.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>65212</course_id><course_title>English for Journalists: Key Concepts</course_title><school>School:  Berkeley</school><review_data_id>123517</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Tariq Hisny</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-08-06</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course is very informative.

There are some elements covering style and content but nothing really about language. There are also significant issues with the grading system. There are some quizzes, but a lot of the work is in non-assessed forms (e.g. make a video and post it online) where you are simply asked to confirm or not if you have completed those activities. This self scoring means that you can 'pass' the course without completing any of the work thus making the end certificate worthless. This is yet another course where I would be upset if I had paid in advance for the certificate as it does not provide any value.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>65212</course_id><course_title>English for Journalists: Key Concepts</course_title><school>School:  Berkeley</school><review_data_id>118893</review_data_id><reviewer_name>July Kor</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-02-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I want to improve speaking skills in English.

So my initial motivation was the $1,000 that AWS was kindly providing; and was hoping that I'd also learn something along the way. I was pleasantly surprised that I have found the class to be very interesting and immediately useful. Each of the steps was clearly explained along with the motivations for the approaches; illustrated with good examples. I highly recommend getting the book; it made the class a lot more efficient for me. The peer assessment; was hit and miss; with some seemingly random marks with no explanations. Anyways; I highly recommend taking this course; I think you will be convinced of its usefulness after just a few lectures (I highly recommend downloading the free first two chapters; as a supplementary (if not primary) material).</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>28699</course_id><course_title>AP® Biology - Part 1: The Cell</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>115173</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Sam Lu</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-11-05</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Instructor stutters and has huge gaps between words sometimes, which can be very distracting as well as annoying.

There are also not enough questions for the quizzes and tests. The only problem with the course was the instructor, as said before. I'm taking the archived course on edX currently, and there was a 10 second type gap between 2 words in one of the videos.

On my formal assessments I stress conceptual questions, and results are good. I attribute this in part to the explanations in the videos. I've also used some of the assessment suggestions.

We recommend you browse the course to learn about GFA, its mission, how it works, the courses that will be available over the coming months, and the outcomes we hope to provide to our learners. Click "See more" to view frequently asked questions. FAQ Is Financial Aid Available? We are pursuing options to make financial aid available, but at this time it is not available to GFA students. Can I receive university credit for courses via GFA even if I have not received my high school diploma or passed the high school equivalency exam? Anyone can take these courses for ASU credit. However, if you’d like to apply them toward a university degree, you will most likely need your high school diploma or proof that you’ve passed the high school equivalency exam. This will also depend on the policies of the particular university to which you are applying. Is GFA for Freshman only? No. While GFA is perfect for incoming Freshman who want to enjoy a flexible, economically-viable model for taking Freshman-level courses, ambitious high school students who want a jump-start for their college career, or adult-learners returning to Freshman year after a hiatus, these introductory-level courses can be taken by anyone who wants to continue lifelong learning or by educators who want to share resources with students. Will GFA be extended to full college degrees? At this time, edX and ASU are focused on breaking down the barriers to successfully completing Freshman year. Will I get a letter grade on my Verified Certificate?  No. Your Verified Certificate is provided by edX to any student who completes an ID Verified course with a passing score (which varies, but will be clearly communicated via course materials) and will not feature a letter grade. Additionally, your Verified Certificate does not equal credit earned by ASU and you will still need to complete the steps required for credit conversion after you have earned the Verified Certificate. Will I get a letter grade on my Arizona State University transcript? Yes students who pursue the ID Verified track will receive a letter grade from ASU for the course and an official Arizona State University transcript if they pay the credit fee. Why is the estimated effort (18 hours per week) for these courses so high?  As a tier-1 public research university, ASU courses reflect the rigorous standards faculty members expect of their students. Given this, ASU recommends that for a 7.5 week course, students should be prepared to spend 6 hours a week on coursework for every 1 course credit. So for a 3 credit course, you should expect to spend approximately 18 hours of coursework per week. To what extent can I use credits earned via GFA to apply for a university degree? Arizona State University is an accredited university. Credits you earn via Global Freshman Academy will appear on an Arizona State University transcript and can be used as transfer credits anywhere ASU credits are accepted. We recommend that you check with your university to see whether ASU credits are accepted. While having earned ASU credits before you apply to a university will not guarantee your admittance, we believe many universities will value the hard work you have already completed. Will Arizona State University credits be accepted at international universities? University credits are typically recognized globally when they come from accredited institutions. Please check with your local university to see Arizona State University credits are accepted. After having taken a class and passed, what is the maximum allotted time to pay for the credit through ASU? You will be able to upgrade from a standard Verified Certificate to credit for one year after you successfully complete and pass the course. How will exam proctoring work? Students who have chosen the Verified track in the course will be asked to re-verify their ID upon launching any proctored exam in a GFA course. During a proctored exam, students will be monitored for the duration of the exam, and suspect behavior will be flagged and reviewed within 3-5 days of exam submission. A webcam will be required for proctored exams. Will GFA courses be offering any accommodations for people with learning disabilities? Especially during proctored exams? edX is committed to achieving full accessibility (WCAG 2.0 compliant or better) in the platform. We are continuously making accessibility improvements as we build out new capabilities and programs in order to meet this stringent standard. In terms of our proctoring solution, we are working with the software vendor and our university partners to ensure anyone taking courses for credit eligibility has an equitable experience. Accessibility is a key requirement for Arizona State University, as well. All Global Freshman Academy courses delivered through the edX platform will be ADA compliant and transcripts for hearing impaired students will be available for each video. What is the full list of courses offered via Global Freshman Academy? To see the most up-to-date list of courses offered by Global Freshman Academy, visit the Future GFA Courses section of the Welcome to Global Freshman Academy Course. If I fail a class in GFA, will it be reflected on my transcript?  If you do not pass the course, you will not be eligible for the upgrade to credit. The failure will not appear anywhere on your ASU transcript. If I fail a GFA course, will I have the option to retake it at no additional cost?  With the Global Freshman Academy, you only pay for the course credit once you receive a passing grade. If you need to retake a course, you can do so at anytime but will be required to again pay the $45 ID Verification fee. If I already know the material of a course offered via GFA, would I have the option to test-out and receive ASU credit?  At this time, we do not offer an option to test out of the material offered in a GFA course. You will need to complete and pass all course material in order to be eligible for credit. Will you have courses in other subject areas? e.g., Education, Management, Psychics, Computer Science, etc. The Global Freshman Academy is a collection of freshman level courses that fulfill a specific set of general education requirements. The general studies focus areas will include Mathematical Studies, English, Humanities, Arts and Design, Social-Behavioral Sciences and Natural Sciences. To see the most up-to-date list of courses offered by Global Freshman Academy, visit the Future GFA Courses section of the Welcome to Global Freshman Academy Course. How do I transfer the credits that I might earn through GFA? Once you complete your course(s) and are ready to transfer the credit earned, you will simply request your official transcript from ASU and submit to the the university to which you are applying. I have previously earned credits from other universities. Can I still take courses through GFA? We would first recommend checking with the university of your choice, whether that is ASU or elsewhere, to see which of the credits you already have would transfer in and what freshman year classes you may still need to take. This will give you a better idea of what GFA courses you would find beneficial.</school><review_data_id>119435</review_data_id><reviewer_name>NASER HASHEM ALJABERI</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-03-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I believe that the idea of the Global Freshman Academy will change millions of people's lives worldwide !</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45329</course_id><course_title>Welcome to Global Freshman Academy</course_title><school>This orientation course is meant to introduce learners, teachers, and higher education leaders to the Global Freshman Academy (GFA).

The freshman year is therefore level 4 studies. What is the equivalent for a U.S. Degree? We need to know how many credits are needed for the freshman year so we can then ascertain the number of courses required to complete year 1. We also need to know how many credits each course is worth to work out how many courses need to be completed. We also do not know what are the CORE courses that have to be completed Maths , Soc sciences, Englishman, Humanities, Arts - Design, Natural Sciences? A typical course in the UK lasts 15 weeks with 10hrs study per week = 150 hrs per course. Also if a student hates maths does that mean they can't get in to a university if they chose not to do a maths course? There are too many unanswered questions here, please could you address them? Otherwise the concept of this education is brilliant and ground breaking thanks to Edex and Mr Agarwal of Harvard!

So for a 3 credit course, you should expect to spend approximately 18 hours of coursework per week. To what extent can I use credits earned via GFA to apply for a university degree? Arizona State University is an accredited university. Credits you earn via Global Freshman Academy will appear on an Arizona State University transcript and can be used as transfer credits anywhere ASU credits are accepted. We recommend that you check with your university to see whether ASU credits are accepted. While having earned ASU credits before you apply to a university will not guarantee your admittance, we believe many universities will value the hard work you have already completed. Will Arizona State University credits be accepted at international universities? University credits are typically recognized globally when they come from accredited institutions. Please check with your local university to see Arizona State University credits are accepted. After having taken a class and passed, what is the maximum allotted time to pay for the credit through ASU? You will be able to upgrade from a standard Verified Certificate to credit for one year after you successfully complete and pass the course. How will exam proctoring work? Students who have chosen the Verified track in the course will be asked to re-verify their ID upon launching any proctored exam in a GFA course. During a proctored exam, students will be monitored for the duration of the exam, and suspect behavior will be flagged and reviewed within 3-5 days of exam submission. A webcam will be required for proctored exams. Will GFA courses be offering any accommodations for people with learning disabilities? Especially during proctored exams? edX is committed to achieving full accessibility (WCAG 2.0 compliant or better) in the platform. We are continuously making accessibility improvements as we build out new capabilities and programs in order to meet this stringent standard. In terms of our proctoring solution, we are working with the software vendor and our university partners to ensure anyone taking courses for credit eligibility has an equitable experience. Accessibility is a key requirement for Arizona State University, as well. All Global Freshman Academy courses delivered through the edX platform will be ADA compliant and transcripts for hearing impaired students will be available for each video. What is the full list of courses offered via Global Freshman Academy? To see the most up-to-date list of courses offered by Global Freshman Academy, visit the Future GFA Courses section of the Welcome to Global Freshman Academy Course. If I fail a class in GFA, will it be reflected on my transcript?  If you do not pass the course, you will not be eligible for the upgrade to credit. The failure will not appear anywhere on your ASU transcript. If I fail a GFA course, will I have the option to retake it at no additional cost?  With the Global Freshman Academy, you only pay for the course credit once you receive a passing grade. If you need to retake a course, you can do so at anytime but will be required to again pay the $45 ID Verification fee. If I already know the material of a course offered via GFA, would I have the option to test-out and receive ASU credit?  At this time, we do not offer an option to test out of the material offered in a GFA course. You will need to complete and pass all course material in order to be eligible for credit. Will you have courses in other subject areas? e.g., Education, Management, Psychics, Computer Science, etc. The Global Freshman Academy is a collection of freshman level courses that fulfill a specific set of general education requirements. The general studies focus areas will include Mathematical Studies, English, Humanities, Arts and Design, Social-Behavioral Sciences and Natural Sciences. To see the most up-to-date list of courses offered by Global Freshman Academy, visit the Future GFA Courses section of the Welcome to Global Freshman Academy Course. How do I transfer the credits that I might earn through GFA? Once you complete your course(s) and are ready to transfer the credit earned, you will simply request your official transcript from ASU and submit to the the university to which you are applying. I have previously earned credits from other universities. Can I still take courses through GFA? We would first recommend checking with the university of your choice, whether that is ASU or elsewhere, to see which of the credits you already have would transfer in and what freshman year classes you may still need to take. This will give you a better idea of what GFA courses you would find beneficial.</school><review_data_id>75237</review_data_id><reviewer_name>ADAMU ALHASSAN</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-05-31</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I AM ABOUT TO START THIS COURSE BUT AFTER READING THE ITS VERY ENRICHING</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69211</course_id><course_title>DO Your Venture: Entrepreneurship for Everyone</course_title><school>School:  Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore</school><review_data_id>122933</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Anupam Bhatt</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-07-21</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Absolutely happy that I had enrolled in the course.

This course is an excellent introduction to nanotransport. The strong points (a) Prof Datta is an excellent teacher and has put a lot of effort to cut down everything in small digestible pieces. (b) The formalism is simplified enough to transmit the message. It is advisable for someone following the course to compare always with standard texts of Solid State Theory, Semiconductors, Quantum and Statistical Mechanics. (c) I specially liked the clear presentation of the ballistic model, the relation to thermodynamics and the presentation of the MOS transistor. A couple of (not so) weak points. (a) the connection of ballistic to diffusive regime was clear but left something to be desired. I would like to si more elaboration specially regarding the time and the lambda parameter. (b) There are a few straight forward applications of the general current expression that could be discussed or worked out or at least referenced such the Richardson law, the Schottky diode, the Arrhenius dependence in hopping conductance or a couple of models in tunneling. Overall, excellent cource, I am looking forward for part 2!</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>65189</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Strategic Management</course_title><school>School:  Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore</school><review_data_id>121678</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Brenda Nassimbwa</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-06-06</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>Am sure this course will upgrade my business skills and am ready to go head thanks to edx and my desire to be here will not go all in vain thax thax thax again</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>65189</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Strategic Management</course_title><school>School:  Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore</school><review_data_id>120851</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Paul Chimedza</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-05-04</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Content is richly crafted and the instructors are professionals.

This course will attempt to teach you how to find and polish an idea for an app by conducting research in a field of interest you have chosen. (Part 1) In short your first task after selecting your field of interest will be to study what and how people actually proceed to achieve their goals. You can do it by simply observing them and their environment, giving them tasks or conducting interviews. The next step is to summarize the research results and identify ideas for your app. You'll be required to write a short academic style paper for it. (Part 2) Once you have the idea(s), you can start designing your app by creating models (service blueprint, use cases and many more). You will also design flows between different screens of your app. At the end of part 2 you will be required to conduct a usability analysis with a paper prototype, or in plain English you will ask people to accomplish some tasks with your paper app. There is a paper to submit here as well. (Part 3) Finally, you'll be coding your application, recording a short video and designing a poster about it. As stated in the description of the course, you'll need to be able to code it by yourself. And now for some pros and cons. The course is interesting, well structured, videos are self explanatory and assignments are... demanding. It's good. As for cons, at least for me, the quiz questions accompanying many video-lectures are a bit imprecise and thus difficult to answer. Good thing is their influence on final score is minimal. The most important drawback (again, in my eyes) is that examples provided for assignments are not good enough. That is – those examples probably wouldn't get the highest possible score from course designers. I understand the idea is to push participants to be creative (or test their reading comprehension of assignment requirements), nevertheless I pref to learn from good examples. In conclusion: if you're interested in ways of deriving an idea from user experience, testing it and actually building (coding) it, then the course might suit your needs.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>51491</course_id><course_title>Mobile Application Experiences Part 3: Building Mobile Apps</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>120468</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Wilson Chen</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-04-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>It seems funny, I hope to create a cool App to show it to my collages and friends.

While I have to clarify that as I'm also studying at the university I had to stopped studying from this class after some days (when it started) because if you're going to take lots of annotations like I did by hand... is going to take some more time from you, which is why I decided to continue now on my vacations. If you already know about medieval times and medieval books you're still going to learn so much from this course just by the simple fact that we have the chance here in seeing them as if we are there in person looking up-close into the scrolls. I didn't know there are so many scrolls regarding the subject of law which is a really interesting big-fact to add to my annotations. Also, my favorite scrolls were the: compendium of the history of world, the universal chronicle of the world which has very beautiful drawings of the creation of the world and of the Genesis; also the Genealogy of the English Kings and one that it was discussed at the end of the program which is the asmat- just wow! such a beautiful scroll from the other side of the world! mixing the liturgy with magic incantations. I also find very interesting the information given in the section of: Italian Humanist Scripts in where you will learn about important figures that has to do with two of the most known and used scripts: the roman and italic script. Take this amazing class and write down everything you can because it has very valuable information to hold on. Thanks for giving this class for free and for a very long period.

Actually, the Rotational Motion is a bit confusing. Without Professor Hafner, I wouldn't pass the course.

An update is overdue. - The instructor is fantastic, but her lecturing pace is lethargic and sometimes verbose.

Often times Statistics is confused with plugging formulas and getting results. As a result people use statistical measures incorrectly without understanding the intuition behind it, when to use and more importantly when not to use a measure. The respected professor makes all of this very clear in her course. I personally benefited from this course even though I am a data analysis professional and have been in this field for the last 8 years. I am planning on taking all of the courses in this series to work towards and advanced understanding in area of data science.

Best of all, it whetted my already considerable poetic appetite, leaving me wanting more. I promised myself if ever the program ran again, I would sign up. Hence ... here I am. There is no adequate way to describe what Pinsky brings to a course. The only thing better than having him instruct online would be to have him as a Prof in person, in my view. Since I live in western Canada, I'll take what I can get. For such a celebrated poet, Pinsky brings a quiet authority to his pedagogy that makes learning a very enjoyable experience; you get no sense that he thinks highly of himself. And, I for one, could listen to that voice forever. The content of the course, in brief, discusses poems in depth and uses Pinsky's "favorite poems" teaching model (his book "Americans' Favorite Poems" is an excellent text that can be used in conjunction with the course but isn't necessary; I didn't have it the first time I took the course but have it now and am glad of it). Charging the students with the task of figuring out what their favorite poems are and why, while teaching them how to annotate each in a scholarly manner, results in each student having an anthology of twelve of their favorite poems with clear annotations about it; a good start to a collection that might carry on after the course. I know with me, I am adding to the course irregularly, but constantly. This is just one aspect of the course, but it's an important one. As for the provider - edX; I am still getting used to this platform (I am much more familiar with Coursera MOOCs because they are the platform of most of the MOOCs I've studied so far - I will say, I found edX difficult to navigate in some respects - going back and forth in discussions etc. but as far as I remember, the assignments and quizzes worked fairly well.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16432</course_id><course_title>Fundamentals of Immunology, Part 2</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>119113</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Dexter Chung</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-03-05</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Comprehensive content, amazing and experienced instructor and the provided outline is really helpful.

The material was well presented and inspired students to think for themselves. Unfortunately the pass grade was lowered significantly during the course, which was somewhat demotivating. The course used peer review of articles written - in general this is a very good idea, but some of the material submitted by students was atrocious and the review was sometimes unfair. If it would be possible to resubmit for another peer review, unfair reviews would not seriously impact the grading. The instructor was very engaging and made this course a joy to attend. I would recommend this course to anyone even slightly interested in the subject matter - and that should be each and every one of us.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>51375</course_id><course_title>Inclusive Leadership Training: Get Beyond Work-Life Balance</course_title><school>School:  Catalyst</school><review_data_id>118040</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Grant Polachek</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-01-30</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>This is a two part review.

It is a course that gives you practical tools, as well as new ways of looking at the subject, leadership. I highly recommend this course to current leaders or those who will become leaders in the near future. Secondly, and on the flip side, I would warn any student or young professional the "fluffy" presentation of course. What does this mean? Well, the hypotheses and conclusions are not always clear and distinct. If you have not been in the trenches of a leadership role, it could be very easy to misinterpret much of the information presented here; in the discussion board, I saw many student drawing conclusions that I do not believe were intended by the instructors--but were logical conclusions based on the presentation of course material. In summary, as someone with leadership experience, I found this course very useful and enlightening--but, students and young professionals, beware of being mislead.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>51489</course_id><course_title>What Now?

For those in the developing world, conducting meaningful research has been the major challenge we have been battling with. With this course, we would be exposed to standard methods of analysing data to yield meaningful results. Also, with the expertise of Prof. Esther (which I always covet positively), and other instructors - I believe this course will be a memorable one. Lastly, I would like to request if Foundation for Development Policy or the challenge of the world poverty could be postponed so that we would able to handle this data analysis and either of those mentioned above together effectively. Those development related courses are so important to us that we cannot not just do any trade off. Thanks for the understanding.

Alex Pentland rocks but in my opinion his ideas are at best if combined with theory U of Otto Scharmer and the way he understand Deep Data.

This was probably the worst I've tried so far (and I've done quite a few already here and on other platforms too). The video quality is bad and the entire course is poorly organised. On week 2 they've restructured the course and they discarded all the scores and our progress from week 1. Then on week 4 they've introduced an additional week so our scores dropped again which means that our progress was shown incorrectly throughout the entire course. The forums are poorly managed too. We are asked to answer questions in the discussion forum (which is great in theory) but in practice we ended up with hundreds of threads in the exact same topic - needless to say I stopped following the discussions. Judging by some of the frustrated comments, you have to be very lucky to get response from a teaching staff. There is inconsistency in the scoring (in addition to discarding the points) and in the number of submissions available (2 submissions for a True of False question - where is the value in this???? --&gt; And then they've corrected it for week 5). We've even had trouble with the correct answer not being listed amongst the answers. I am going to complete, because I am not a quitter, but I can't wait for this to finish... very disappointing....</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>2</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>68516</course_id><course_title>Statistical Thinking for Data Science and Analytics</course_title><school>School:  Columbia University</school><review_data_id>117820</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Dan Mavr</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-01-22</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>Since I had no previous experience with statistics, I ended up with more handwritten notes than I wrote in the whole first year of university studies.

I don't really learn very well from lectures. Call it personal preference. Call it years of Engineering, but simply watching video lectures, video lectures that are not that interactive with examples, are not conducive to absorbing and retaining material. The same goes for reading sample literature. The best way to learn, in my opinion, is by practicing concepts, and there was very little opportunity to apply what was learned. I think this was the attempt of the applied lectures each week, but spending several hours actually working problems would be a more efficient way to drive home concepts. The homework in the course was too easy, and the R examples were simply copying and pasting, rather than letting somebody try to develop skills in R. Yes, they could do it on their own, but they could do it on their own without taking this course. From a practical standpoint, a lot of charts presented in the lectures were unreadable. From a schedule standpoint, starting the class at a time when people are on vacation or visiting families seemed unnecessary. I still have the Bayesian week remaining, so maybe the course will improve. I will still continue on with the track, because I am interested in Machine Learning. Hopefully it will improve.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>34615</course_id><course_title>Evaluating Social Programs</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>121695</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Basil Ogbozor</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-06-06</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>I found the course very exciting and challenging, especially in terms of time required to go through all the stuff.

Not adequate, but I still recommend taking this course as practice. Helps refine your programming skills in a VERY esoteric fashion. If you ever decide to learn Android App Dev. then at least you will have SOMETHING to start with. But yeah, for the most part you learn nothing. We created so many objects, but I never truly understood why we were creating the classes, although I looked it up in the Android Developer API. Well, still, I learned a lil bit about App Dev. and that's worth something. Was it worth the time? Don't know. Maybe not.

A few videos on the subject with some interesting people, that's about it, all of it's content. No one leads the discussion, no one monitors it, people have a lot of problems and issues with organization, keep opening topics with same questions and no one to answer. Some people payed for certificate, late comers, only to find out they can not access and do their assignments. You took their money, but won't to anything to make them access all the content and earn the certificate they payed for, not even answer their questions? That's just not fair. As if it is run by a bot. Very disappointing. So different from all the other courses I took, where real enthusiasts, professionals and people care and engage and make it work and make our effort worth. You'll do nothing and learn almost nothing (what short video lectures provide is something you probably already know or can read anywhere and can be put in a 30 minute video altogether).</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69863</course_id><course_title>Creativity &amp; Entrepreneurship</course_title><school>School:  Berklee College of Music</school><review_data_id>118333</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-02-09</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I see that the instructor Mr. Panay knows what he is talking about and the people whom he speaks with in the course are very well versed.

I was new to the MOOC model and I'm glad that I had a course as an introduction to the format - the fact that it was so interesting made learning the format that much easier. I had always had an awareness of cyberwarfare/surveillance issues within our society, but I have to day my decisions were not always based upon anything more than a 'gut feeling.' While I wouldn't say my decisions or perspective have changed radically, I can at least say that they are founded on a decent body of knowledge. The only criticism I would have of this course is that some of the assessment pieces were needlessly complicated. This isn't to say that everything should have been easy, but the exercise requiring you to rank several concepts in order of their (seemingly subjective) desirability/utility was very frustrating, given there seemed to be no metric to measure this against. Despite this, I think the inclusion of interviews with Bruce Schneier and Mike Schmitt (to name a few) to sound a warning of sorts was an excellent choice. The fact that additionally this was a course that evidently tried to present a balanced picture by noting the benefits of modern surveillance capabilities and how they can work both ways is to me exemplary.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45182</course_id><course_title>Cyberwar, Surveillance and Security</course_title><school>School:  University of Adelaide</school><review_data_id>118886</review_data_id><reviewer_name>vincent li</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-02-28</review_date><review_value>3</review_value><review>There isn't much of anything here.

It's a good example of that type of course. It takes a supposedly "simple" and abstract concept and relates it to multiple disciplines of thought. In this case these included sociology, psychology, economics, mathematics, management, and music. All this is done in a way that can be useful to professionals in various fields. That said, there was a great deal of highly technical language, especially early in the course. The quizzes were fairly difficult because some answers hinged on fine distinctions. Some of the quizzes only had two available points, one of which was a multiple checkbox question and if any of the boxes were wrong you lost the point. Overall, I would say that this class could be useful to people whose profession involves complex, multivariate problems in the human sciences: education, criminal justice, business management and the like.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45344</course_id><course_title>Ignorance!</course_title><school>School:  Australian National University</school><review_data_id>111081</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-08-07</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>I thought it would be different than it was. I was expecting a discussion of ignorance and what can be done to eliminate or at least deal with it. Instead it was a paean to ignorance as a good thing. I disagree. I appreciate the effort that the instructors went to. It's not easy putting together any kind of course. I would not recommend this one, however, unless you really love the social sciences (I don't and didn't before this but was hoping to learn something anyway) and want to be made to feel better that you're ignorant. If you actually think it's good to try not to be ignorant, this will be a very frustrating and boring course. The discussion forum set up is horrible. This is not the fault of the course staff. EdX just has a horrible discussion platform. Unfortunately, this course requires discussion posts. That just makes it all the more frustrating.

The instructors didn't seem to be any too aware of what the difference between what lack of information, and true ignorance is. They, (and consequently many students) simply saw it as all the same thing. It isn't. I was so put off by the low level of meaningful discussion, the insipid comments, and the lack of any actual information that I bounced out before seeing all the videos, and perhaps that is the most telling critique. It was very poor.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>34832</course_id><course_title>Introduction to the Treatment of Urban Sewage </course_title><school>School:  Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)</school><review_data_id>123058</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Matembe Francois</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-07-24</review_date><review_value>1</review_value><review>The level of English is average plus this course only touches upon the main topic a bit.

I think this course is a very nice complement to the much more theoretical but also very interesting courses provided by MITx under 8.05.1x,8.05.2x, and 8.05.3x. Utokyo003x is an intermediate course; some previous knowledge of Quantum Mechanics is almost necessary. The notation is often not explained, but it is standard in Quantum Mechanics (thus one should be able to recognize that h is Planck constant, c is the speed of light and so on).</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45227</course_id><course_title>Quantum Mechanics of Molecular Structures</course_title><school>School:  The University of Tokyo</school><review_data_id>119942</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Ahmad Shan -I- Ilahee Chowdhury</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-03-30</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>There are lots of things you need to consider when deciding which schools, and/or universities I want to apply to train with.

For people with prior Chemistry and Physics knowledge, the course might not be needed at all. In both cases, what is the point of the course? # Failed to mention prerequisites The course syllabus or introduction did not mentioned the level or requirement in order to understand the course materials. The first week of the course seemed manageable. The everyday topics like global warming and colours were interesting. But the materials plunged to a difficult and abstract level when I ventured deeper into the course. I found the materials required at least university level of Chemistry, Physics and Pure Mathematics to understand. If you have no training of these subjects before, you would better skip this whole course. # Very limited guidance to after-video quizzes Nine out of ten quizzes, I yelled to the screen because I could not understand how the quizzes were related to the videos. It was quite hopeless to find help in the discussion area. People who could answer the quizzes already understood the materials (again, why need this course then?), or they were with extremely high IQ. Could you please at least list out all the terms in the mathematical expressions in the videos and explain them? In the slides, they are all Greek alphabets. Suddenly in the questions, you ask about "vibrational frequencies", "force constant”, and other stuff. Hey, which is which? Could you please at least provide hints to the questions, for example, “please use the knowledge gained from lesson 2.4 and 2.6 to calculate…”? # No calculations examples were given in the slides So the videos were about deriving mathematical expressions. The first time you would see an example of how to apply those equation was when you click the “Show Answer” button AFTER answering the questions correctly. Oh wow. I mean, you only teach people who already knew how to get it correctly? # Too abstract Okay, so you talked about quantized level v0, v1, etc. And I finally guessed how to calculate the answers of the questions. But hey, could you at least tell me what is the meaning of the v0, v1, etc. in a way that is easier to understand? Like, tell me it is the energy needed for an electron to escape, rotate, or something. After these materials, I got a bunch of Greek alphabets, strange looking equations, and some calculus skills. What are their implications? What are the terms? How can I use them? To sum up, this course is more of an IQ test, math test, and a hide-and-seek game, rather than “Quantum Mechanics of Molecular Structures“.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45227</course_id><course_title>Quantum Mechanics of Molecular Structures</course_title><school>School:  The University of Tokyo</school><review_data_id>116262</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Claudio Felicioli</reviewer_name><other_review_count>58</other_review_count><other_course_completed>58</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/claudio8</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-11-30</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>Short introductory level quantum mechanics, with a focus on molecular identification.

The instructions are poorly explained and the guidelines for the assignments (AKA what is expected of the students) are revealed after submissions, which is of no help. The assignments are also randomly reviewed by our peers, which means that our grades are at the mercy of people who are either overly critical or uninterested. So, you could have ended up with a low grade or no grade, depending on who your peers were for a particular assignment. Ultimately, I ended up dropping the course and have no desire to retake it in the future.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45326</course_id><course_title>Exploring Humans’ Space: An Introduction to Geographicity</course_title><school>School:  École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</school><review_data_id>113565</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Paul Hundal</reviewer_name><other_review_count>124</other_review_count><other_course_completed>109</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/paulhundal1</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-09-28</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>This is the worst designed course I have ever come across on EDx.

That explains why it is so superficial..you get a bit of this and a bit of that, and there is no interaction with the instructor. But it is only at the end that you get the pitch for their "real" class, in which there is instructor interaction. I wouldn't have been so annoyed if the presenter were up front about the fact that this is a teaser. That being said, the presenter is non-threatening and appealing. A suggestion: If more schools start pulling this stunt, that edx characterizes each class, not just by title and topic, but also by type..."real" class or teaser.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>51174</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Music Theory</course_title><school>School:  Berklee College of Music</school><review_data_id>122117</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Christine Mixed</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-06-23</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>I think that it's good that there is a free course to take online.

The team does an excellent job with their support. I can assure you of the fact that you will receive a quick response from staff and your problem will be solved. Instructors' explanation is satisfying, in general. Although, they leave few parts unclear and you may need to do some research on the Net to get the point.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45466</course_id><course_title>Effects of Radiation: An Introduction to Radiation and Radioactivity </course_title><school>School:  Open Education Consortium</school><review_data_id>110801</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Paul Hundal</reviewer_name><other_review_count>124</other_review_count><other_course_completed>109</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/paulhundal1</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-08-04</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>The information is a bit scattered. Many questions came to mind, few answers. Strictly speaking the information itself was good but it covered too many topics with mixed depth, especially where it purports to discuss the impacts of radiation on human health. They also used some of the worst marking strategies for MOOC's such as input text questions that created lots of problems with people getting marked wrong for right answers and peer assessed final exam which is ls nothing more than a random mark with little educational value. To their credit they responded to the complaints about input text questions (and hopefully will not make the mistake of using them in the future) and limited the grade impact of peer assessed questions to 10% of the total mark so you could choose not to waste your time with it and still pass. I think they have the makings of a good course but it needs work. They used very effective translators for the videos and did an excellent job of presentation in those videos.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45466</course_id><course_title>Effects of Radiation: An Introduction to Radiation and Radioactivity </course_title><school>School:  Open Education Consortium</school><review_data_id>75746</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Mukhlis Ismail</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-06-25</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>I teach student about the isotopes at the university</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>34619</course_id><course_title>Explore Statistics with R</course_title><school>School:  KIx: Karolinska Institutet</school><review_data_id>118246</review_data_id><reviewer_name>student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-02-07</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Excellent course, great instructions, interesting subject.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>34619</course_id><course_title>Explore Statistics with R</course_title><school>School:  KIx: Karolinska Institutet</school><review_data_id>117156</review_data_id><reviewer_name>student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-12-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is one of the best R programming classes. I took this class last year and this was my first R programming class. I didn't know this at the time but looking back this proved to be the best R programming class for me by far. Dr. Andreas Montelius and staff at Karolinska did a great job explaining important details that made understanding the language a lot easier. I found myself coming back to the lectures and my notes to clarify a concept or just remind myself how to do something. Keep in mind that on-line classes are inherently difficult and many times you are left on your own - sink or swim. This class, and this must be said, went the extra mile.

I felt like there was some potential but it didn't deliver in terms of quality. I was hoping this class would give me a few more ideas about what type of path I want to take in my professional career. The only thing I really managed to get out of this was what my personality type was. That is good but there wasn't enough to build on that. Maybe I have to take more than one program to get the full feel but this didn't make me want to jump in to the others. I think honestly using the peer review system would really help in this class. The passing grade of 85% is also rather high for this. Made me really nervous because the final exam didn't really make much sense to me.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>36389</course_id><course_title>On-Ramp to AP* French Language and Culture</course_title><school>School:  Weston High School</school><review_data_id>122257</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Carmen Cecilia Chang Chávez</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-06-28</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>I love this course because it makes me improve my grammar and writing skills.

Microsoft's offerings have all been really good, but this is a departure from that. I agree with what Abhinav Agnihotri said.

Overall I enjoyed this course and found it both a useful refresher as well as a good foundation for much of the statistics required in the remainder of the data science degree curriculum from Microsoft. What I liked was the more university-style approach the lecturers had to the topics, many of whom are experts in their field. My only criticism is that the accents are sometimes difficult to pick up for those lecturers for whom English is another language they speak. I found this course took significant time to complete. Many of the lectures are an hour or more of content, which I find is too long for a self-paced course--I would prefer shorter lectures broken up with comprehension assessments to help maintain my concentration. THis is a good course and I recommend it, but allow enough time to complete it.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>49839</course_id><course_title>Statistical Thinking for Data Science and Analytics</course_title><school>School:  Columbia University</school><review_data_id>123612</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Abhinav Agnihotri</reviewer_name><other_review_count>2</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/abhinav21</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-08-09</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>Since statistics is an all new subject for me, I don't have any frame of reference to compare the contents of the course. However I believe that all subjects are interesting in themselves and the way of presentation makes the subject boring or interesting. I am currently going through the 2nd week of material and I can feel that this is going nowhere. Contents of the slides seem to be put in a lot of haste. There are a number of terms and concepts that have not been clarified, which are popping up now and again in the lecture videos. Since this has been labeled as and INTRODUCTORY course, fundamentals should be discussed and taught in a systematic manner without giving a superficial glance. So far, I am getting a feeling that the course has been designed for revision of those who have studies these concepts before and want to brush up the basics. I am not sure if the content provided is not upto the mark or it is the teaching style of Professor Tian Zheng that made the lectures very confusing and uninteresting. A lot of cramming seems to be required as it is very difficult to understand the principles. In summary, a lot of work is required from the content providers and the presenting professors.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>49839</course_id><course_title>Statistical Thinking for Data Science and Analytics</course_title><school>School:  Columbia University</school><review_data_id>121268</review_data_id><reviewer_name>student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-05-20</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>The course content was a bit slow for someone who is already a proficient programmer and who has been in an AP Stats class all year, but this mostly pertains to the first two weeks of the course. The part about graphs being comparisons was a bit more interesting but wasn't really riveting. I think that I wasn't exactly the target audience though for this. I think that ultimately, the points about the inaccuracy of statistical measures due to the qualities of the data were some of the more fascinating ones, but yeah. The points about bayesian statistics and text analysis were also interesting. I think that the point here that was most lacking was the instructors as well as many of the discussion questions. Both were boring, uninteresting, or had to go over the same point over and over again. However, some of these points that were worth hearing. Overall, I think this was an informative course.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69892</course_id><course_title>Statistics for Business - II</course_title><school>School:  Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore</school><review_data_id>117572</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-01-12</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I totally loved the first module of this course.

It was said less than 300 students managed to score at least 55%, which was surprising, since the course wasn't that hard. I hope they prepare themselves better for the 3rd module.

It hits the standard notes of survey history and introduces little else. Often a good teacher who really understands the era will give some non-conventional insights that expand your understanding beyond superficial facts. So instead of mentioning the old cliche that the Arabs were the heirs of Greek science and philosophy, such a teacher would elaborate how these ancient texts were integrated and interpreted by Arabs, and how wide their influence was. However, I received no such insights from this class. Nonetheless, the class does a fair job retelling the key events of ancient Western history. To those of you who really know nothing about this subject, I'd recommend trying a few lectures to see if the teaching style works for you. The professors seemed intelligent and capable. Just a heads up: the worst part of this course is Lesson 4, which covers the history of the Jews. The professor more or less retells the Hebrew Bible as if it were an accurate historical account. In fact, he doesn't even add a little disclaimer, "According to Jewish tradition..." or "The Jewish people believed that..."; no, he indiscriminately uses scripture as history. No outside sources, no archaeology, no analysis of the Hebrew Bible's biases! Recently I've been listening to Yale's excellent course on the Old Testament. Professor Hayes introduces archaeological evidence, compares Biblical stories to similar Near Eastern legends, and analyses the contradictions and biases present in scripture. This gives a clear, thoughtful portrait of the ancient Jewish world. If Jewish history interests you (and indeed it is fascinating!) I would recommend that course.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>49850</course_id><course_title>Western Civilization: Ancient and Medieval Europe</course_title><school>School:  Arizona State University</school><review_data_id>116390</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Renee Swenson</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-12-04</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I loved this class and was sorry when it ended.

Having said that, I was somewhat disappointed that the course didn’t show that to the extent it should have, except for the excellent lecture videos by Prof. Irazoqui. The course lacked a weekly rhythm imposed by a well-planned schedule, and graded weekly targets, so the discussion forum, which is often one of the best aspects of online learning, was left virtually unmoderated and served mainly as a place to vent about practicum software issues and the course's buggy grading system. The practicum, although very interesting and potentially highly rewarding in its concept, has become a cause of some student aggravation, since the Raspberry Pi/Linux/Python stack has shown to be too high maintenance and distracted the students from focussing on the signals and their processing. The potentially very interesting practical work with bioelectric signals, and later a numerical solution of the seminal Hodgkin-Huxley equation, was left without academic reward since the assignments were neither compulsory nor graded, which was somewhat demotivating. Finally, the unavailability of the solutions for the midterm and the final exam left the students in the dark, without possibility to learn from their mistakes. I think this course has a great potential and could, with some effort from the course staff, do justice to its fabulous topic and easily become one of the most attractive MOOC offerings.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>46988</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Bioelectricity</course_title><school>School:  Purdue University</school><review_data_id>116115</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jeran Zen</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-11-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I Really wanted to do this course, but now it says Enrollment is close -_- There was no warning that I had to enroll before a specific date.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>46988</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Bioelectricity</course_title><school>School:  Purdue University</school><review_data_id>111936</review_data_id><reviewer_name>CHRISTIAN HERNANDEZ</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-08-25</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>Esto es para certificar que Mateo Rastreador completado con éxito y recibió una calificación aprobatoria en Example001x: Introducción a Bioelectricidad un curso de estudio ofrecido por UniversityX, un aprendizaje en línea iniciativa de la Universidad X a través edx.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45214</course_id><course_title>Introduction to TypeScript</course_title><school>School:  Microsoft</school><review_data_id>121724</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Thomas Weitzel</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-06-07</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>This was my first exposure to TypeScript.

I don't live in the USA, and this course has still been useful. I now have a list of actions I can take (and have started already) that will improve my personal financial situation.

The assignments are far more complicated than what the instructor goes over during lecture. And viewing the discussion boards, I'm not the only one who feels this way. It's incredibly frustrating to do the assignments, unable to correctly answer after you exhausted all your attempts, and they decided not to share the correct answer. So you have no clue what the correct solution is. The bottom line is this course is not worth the time or effort.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>67550</course_id><course_title>AP® Psychology - Course 1: What is Psychology?</course_title><school>School:  University of British Columbia</school><review_data_id>122486</review_data_id><reviewer_name>abdalla osman</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-07-05</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>the basic information about psychology and un ideas for some psychologists. so its better if the course contain a lot of information about psychology.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>67550</course_id><course_title>AP® Psychology - Course 1: What is Psychology?</course_title><school>School:  University of British Columbia</school><review_data_id>121715</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Miracle Harold</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-06-07</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>It's very technical in the aspect of teaching students methods which psychologists use during researches</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>46938</course_id><course_title>CLEP Information Systems and Computer Applications, Part 1: IT</course_title><school>School:  Universitat Politècnica de Valencia</school><review_data_id>121968</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Raghava B</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-06-17</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Well structured course with rich information and commitment to impart knowledge,thanks to the instructors</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>46938</course_id><course_title>CLEP Information Systems and Computer Applications, Part 1: IT</course_title><school>School:  Universitat Politècnica de Valencia</school><review_data_id>113336</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Rajanand Ilangovan</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-09-22</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>Completed the entire course in 45 min.

I did not have any background in agricultural sciences and I found the MOOC challenging and illuminating. I appreciated the ability to rewind videos and read the transcripts. I think the instructors were well paced and I liked the visuals used, especially since some were provided as handouts and others were referenced in the videos. I felt the course was geared towards understanding how the physical aspects in a plant (from photosynthesis, assimilation, respiration, transpiration, soil properties, nutrient uptake, etc.) are modeled in something like the crop simulator. I liked the ease of using the crop simulator and the questions that tested my understanding. Having the separation of “Questions for Practice” and then the “Questions for grading” was great. Despite being multiple-choice, the questions required thought and many were quantitative. The practice section had explanations with the proper steps and detailed what mistake we may have made if we selected a wrong choice. I found these questions useful in really checking my understanding. They were challenging but once I saw the practice I had a chance to improve on the graded ones. I liked the “from the field” videos, which added some real-world connection to the material, and the “delve deep” videos, which had great visual experiments. I particularly enjoyed seeing the surprising differences between clay and sandy soils. I took this course as a self-paced course. I treated it like a real class and took notes as I went along so that I could keep them for the future. Because of timing issues, I tried to condense the suggested 6 weeks into about 4. The drawback of this was that I could not conduct the experiment. This was my first successful completion of an edX MOOC class and I recommend it as a way to become familiar with what happens in plants from a yield perspective with sufficient but not overwhelming detail.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>34643</course_id><course_title>Future Food Production: Crops</course_title><school>School:  Wageningen University</school><review_data_id>114298</review_data_id><reviewer_name>student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-10-13</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>Unfortunately I am very disappointed with the course. It started well with the explaination of the differences in C3/ C4 plants. This lecture was both interesting and challenging. But then it became more and more superficial especially the actual production and the topic of climate change was very unsatisfying. The topic of pests and deseases basically said that there exist different pests and deseases and different methods of treating them - that does not meet the expectations. Furthermore it barely touches the topic climate change in the aspect that agriculture is a mayor contributer to climate change -bigger than all transportation - and the potential for mitigation is not discussed at all. The MOOC shows the current business as usual, but I didn´t see a glimse of innovation or any appropriate method to meet the challenges of future crop production.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>49840</course_id><course_title>Career Edge: Communication and Teamwork</course_title><school>School:  Fullbridge</school><review_data_id>118757</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jonathan McKinsey</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-02-24</review_date><review_value>5</review_value><review>I don't know why my previous comment got removed.

This is a relatively new method of scoring ' ESSAY's ', (AES); AUTOMATED ESSAY SCORING, under (PEG); PROJECT ESSAY GRADE. The emphasis, being on cost, accountability, standards, and technology. In other words saving hundreds of thousands of dollars for institutions to increase their profit margin at the students academic expense! Consequently many students were denied the appropriate score...due to an inherit malfunction. The computer is programed to filter for vocabulary, long paragraphs, grammar, style, and other details which are never listed for the student. The 'HUMAN FACTOR', substance , content,and strength of the overall argument isn't even considered, evaluated, or even read by a human-being. The score is analytically determined by an inherently flawed computer generated program, that is currently under constant development...refinement, because it's broken! Since writing my initial review and posting it, there have been changes made to my final grade which had been 92% overall as issued on completion certificate dated 14 Jan. 2014. My overall grade has now mysteriously been changed to 77% and two of the essays for which I was complaining about, the grades have mysteriously vanished from my course progress report. Something is awry...? Or perhaps they are under further review? I have not been informed if such is the case. I will therefore resist from further criticism of this course until I'm aware of what is exactly being done with my grade and the questionable essay grading by an imperfect computer program, which has allegedly been programmed to analytically grade the 'HUMAN FACTOR', of a students cognitive literary expression. I stand by my former review and it's content...!  ***UPDATE: As of 10 July 2014, my overall progress report now reads an overall grade of 4%, everything has been erased with the exception of 5 completed lectures with scores of 100% each. Is this a computer cliche or retribution for my review for 3-stars; ' COURSE QUALITY '...? This is the only course that has deleted my prior scores from a progress report, the other courses that I've completed have not been altered in any section. Therefore this ambiguity raises another ' RED FLAG ', for what appears to be intentional altering of my 92% overall grade which had been issued on my completion certificate, dated 14 Jan. 2014. As of today 13 July 2014, the overall grade is 4%...! Once again let me reiterate, there have been no notifications  about this coincidental discrepancy which occurred, immediately after my 3-star rating for this course! It would appear that it's not a computer cliche but an alleged dubious ' MANIPULATION by HUMAN(s)...!!! I, completed this course 6 months ago with an overall score of 92% . All of these negative actions have occurred during this past week, just hours after posting my review! *** REFERENCE: Wikipedia Encyclopedia; AUTOMATED ESSAY SCORING, (AES); 11 pgs., citations; 45 pgs.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45449</course_id><course_title>Making Science and Engineering Pictures: A Practical Guide to Presenting Your Work</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>117598</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Richard T</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-01-13</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course was very interesting, and although does require a consumer grade scanner and DSLR camera, they are not out of the reach of most people who have the means to have a computer.

I found the self-review questions presented at the conclusion of each section to be much more beneficial in making sure each portion was properly understood.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>41146</course_id><course_title>Formulación y nomenclatura de compuestos químicos</course_title><school>School:  Universitat Politècnica de Valencia</school><review_data_id>121304</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Alejandra Rondon Vargas</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>0</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/alejandra10</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-05-22</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>es muy bueno el contenido, ya que dan nuevas oportunidades de aprender de formas diferentes,. el instructor es excelente</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>14091</course_id><course_title>Innovation and Commercialization</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>117404</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Claudio Felicioli</reviewer_name><other_review_count>58</other_review_count><other_course_completed>58</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/claudio8</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-01-08</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I have taken the 2013/2014 version of this course.

There are about 60 minutes of high-quality video lectures each week, followed by a quiz and programming exercises. The programming exercises are in MATLAB through a web interface, usually adding some missing functionality to a program. The MATLAB web interface is much improved compared with parts 1 and 2 of this course, though understanding the complete program is still sometimes frustrating. The final week is an exam which took me about 90 minutes to complete. High-school maths is enough to complete this part of the course and I think you could do this part of the course without first completing parts 1 and 2.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>68057</course_id><course_title>Supply Chain Analytics</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>123809</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Khurshid Ahmed</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-08-16</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Course content is very good and having high profile in current market and in supply Chain management.

It is not for people new to C++ or programming. The grading and assignment system has serious problems. Students' submissions are reviewed by other students, which must occur before your submissions are considered complete. Two of my submissions were never reviewed by another student (for whatever reason), so I didn't get full 'credit'. According the progress chart, I averaged 100%, and got a '85%' final grade in the class. The class has since been archived, despite due dates for the assignments are listed far in the future. Also, it appears students who want certificates are not getting them, despite finishing the course.

The adaptation to edX is just horrible, the worst edX experience so far.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>4</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>48808</course_id><course_title>Introduction to C++</course_title><school>School:  Microsoft</school><review_data_id>114141</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Mark Richter</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-10-09</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>This is a very basic introduction to C++ and presents the basics of data types and functions. However I found it to be inconsistent, disorganized, and probably hard to follow for someone with no experience with programming. It is presented as a four week course, but the material is closer to 1-2 weeks of a typical edX class. The video sections provide good material, but there seems to be only about 60 minutes total for the entire course. The written material has so many typos that it feels unprofessional.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>3</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>48808</course_id><course_title>Introduction to C++</course_title><school>School:  Microsoft</school><review_data_id>115388</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Julian de Fermat</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-11-10</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>The course assumes a lot of knowledge.

Nope. But this short course offers a nice introduction, particularly if you already have some exposure to C. The course covers the basics of C++ data types, input/ouput, control statements, and simple classes. Written materials are provided and the lectures, which are very good, emphasize the practical points. Not everything is taught from first principles, though, so if you're new to C-style programming, you may find yourself facing unfamiliar terminology now and then; fortunately, there are plenty of tutorial resources on the web, including ebooks. The assignments could use some improvement: the quizzes are easy and the small amount of actual programming is unfortunately peer-reviewed, which is not well suited to the subject matter. Microsoft should consider providing coding windows that allow you to enter code and have it compiled and executed -- that's the way most programming courses do it, and it would improve the effectiveness of this otherwise worthwhile introduction considerably.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>2</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>48808</course_id><course_title>Introduction to C++</course_title><school>School:  Microsoft</school><review_data_id>115150</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Andre Marin</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-11-05</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>I didn't believe this course was very well structured for those students new to C++. This was more like an overview of C++ useful for experienced programmers in a different language. The assignments were not challenging or really graded except for peer reviews that poorly structured. Overall it was "okay" considering there are not other active C++ courses on edX, but I wasn't impressed with the quality.

The culture is diverse, no one photo is going to represent its entirety. If we assume someone raised within a Spanish culture does not need to do a course on Spanish language and culture, then the image needs to be externally identifiable. As someone raised outside Spanish culture, bullfighting and flamenco are on the surface, representative, as would be images of conquistadores and tapas (how many are reading this with dispair?). From an external perspective it's not whether the image represents the whole culture, but what is easily identifiable and differentiating from other cultures. Seeing any of these four images triggers a recognition that this is "something Spanish".</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>67520</course_id><course_title>Programming in R for Data Science</course_title><school>School:  Microsoft</school><review_data_id>123716</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Rajiv Tinaikar</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-08-12</review_date><review_value>5</review_value><review>The content is good, so is the instructor, but felt that the exercises in few modules are out of sync, eg. the module covers one topic and exercise is different to what have been taught in the same topic.

I say this because the format of the course worked for me--short, and to-the-point lectures, followed by short practical exercises that reinforce the topic covered. However, do not be fooled, this course requires you to perform practical exercises in R in order to complete the practical exercises, some of which will require a little extra research (which is fine by me) to be able to answer correctly. I liked the short and to-the-point lectures, which worked well for me, short enough for me to maintain my concentration; if I remember correctly, the longest video is about 8 minutes. One thing I liked about this course in the Microsoft Professional Degree curriculum is that it provided a good opportunity to reinforce many of the topics in R that have been covered previously, while building on that knowledge and providing more information.

There's little to no instruction and the instructor pretty much only appears in a short intro video at the start of each unit. It's structured as a series of quizzes, with some hints for each question. It's completely up to the student to figure out what they're looking at and how to solve the test problems. Unless you've just recently completed precalculus, you will almost certainly have to do a good deal of googling to find explanations of the concepts you're being asked to implement. I'm a pretty hardcore autodidact, and I appreciate what the instructors were trying to do here. I can also see how this course structure might appeal to some people. But I feel like the target audience is pretty limited. I would imagine that most people seeing these concepts for the first time would feel hopelessly lost.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>48095</course_id><course_title>Discovery Precalculus: A Creative and Connected Approach</course_title><school>School:  The University of Texas at Austin</school><review_data_id>122248</review_data_id><reviewer_name>kevin casimir</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-06-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course is not for the faint of heart.

Those who do not have this background can barely keep but but can still learn a bit about this new field of physics. Very little is said about the main broad appeal for the subject (topological quantum computing) in favour of establishing the fundamentals of the field. Short introductory - summary videos are made by a different expert each week and vary tremendously in quality. The main lecture material is a wiki-like exposition, which also varies in quality. There are multiple-answer questions throughout the text. The assignments are reading recent papers on arxiv and writing a response to them (nice) and exploring the week's topics in a python programme (often vague and too time-consuming). The course instructors answer questions in the discussion promptly and thoroughly. They are genuinely world leaders in the field and very nice.

The TAs are very readily available in the discussion form so that was helpful. Instructors are great and use great examples, making the content easy to understand and follow. I took the previous part 1 and 2 which I really like since I like the science behind all the concepts. This part 3 is set up differently, more general but still based on science.

Quizzes wouldn't work, due dates would be wrong, homework wouldn't show up on the progress page. I and so many other students reported the problems, and in the month that this course ran, they never got fixed. An instructor logged in about half-way through the course to mark some of the problems as having been fixed. But they hadn't been! And she never showed back up. The discussion board in the course is filled with complaints about what a poor job was done by edX and with fury about the unresponsiveness of the course staff. I think that these book clubs are a great idea. I think that this novel was great, and the questions that were asked about the novel were sensible. Some of the people I encountered in the discussions offered insightful comments and content. So, this model, to me, could provide a valuable experience. But edX needs to exert a little oversight on the courses so that they aren't of such low quality and so that obvious, easily fixable problems are addressed. I would be embarrassed if I were the instructor--Maggie Sokolik--or Berkeley or edX and was putting my name on this produce. I can't believe that they are willing to take money for this.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>42214</course_id><course_title>"A Room with a View" by Forster: BerkeleyX Book Club</course_title><school>School:  Berkeley</school><review_data_id>118593</review_data_id><reviewer_name>R Hill</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-02-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course is wonderful for a book junkie like me. It's allowing me to read some of my dusty covers. I really want to applaud the creator of this course for the vocabulary and background element that has adds to the intensity of the reading experience that otherwise would have been linear. It has been truly a learning experience for me. From the book discussed, "The Room with a View", we had to learn words from different soils; as well as, deep research into the Edwardian era's politics, customs, economics, trends, and religions to name a few. I found it interesting in learning that the women's shoe had neither left or right before this era, or that corsets were wore as honorable to ones family, or that Audubon Society began due to the mass-amounts of birds being killed that adorn women all around the globe. Go figure. It not only aids my learning in this read, but several books yet been explored. I do agree with the above reviews concerning homework deadlines and grammatical correctness requirements, but I try to keep in mind that this is a book club...the best I have been a part of in my life.

The content would possibly be ok, but the course has been plagued by technical and organizational problems. Specifically, though all course materials say that homework and quizzes are due on Wednesdays, and though the first week's work was due on Wednesday, somebody set the later due dates in the system to Mondays. So, for two weeks running, a large number of students did their homework and readings but couldn't turn in their homework. This seems like a simple mistake with a simple fix. But several days after the problems began to appear, no problems have been fixed, and EDX and course administrators have not even contacted students back on their concerns/complaints. The message board is filled with people complaining about the poor quality and unresponsiveness of the course administrators. From my perspective, these book clubs are a good idea, but half-way through, this one has been carried out out very poorly.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>42214</course_id><course_title>"A Room with a View" by Forster: BerkeleyX Book Club</course_title><school>School:  Berkeley</school><review_data_id>118072</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Walter Rocha</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-02-01</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>The content I find very good, I'm able to learn.

I don't normally write course reviews until all the course content is available, but I feel compelled to write this review early (after the 3rd week of 6) because the course is diverging from my expectations so I may not finish it. I love to play board games and have designed a few board/card games in the past that never really got off the ground. I signed up for this course with the hope that it might help me improve a game I'm working on. The course description and promo video suggest that it would mainly focus on general game mechanics, prototyping and play testing, with little to no mention of video games outside of some digital prototyping. The first 3 weeks give some attention to both board games and video games, but the course is focusing more and more on video games with each successive week. The majority of guest speaker time and homework project time is devoted to digital games. The final 3 weeks cover digital prototyping, user interfaces and the business of games, which are likely to be heavily skewed toward video games over board games. Intro to game design has good content and for someone interested in making digital games, it would probably be a great course. Its main failing is that it didn't make it clear ahead of time that the focus of the course was going to be digital games. As it stands now, the course tries to split time and assignments between board and video games, which is not ideal. There are sections that are useful for board game designers here and there but it is getting difficult to weed through all the video-game oriented content. The course would be better split into 2 courses, one for board/card game design and one for digital game design.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45488</course_id><course_title>Medicating for Mental Health: Judicious Use of Psychiatric Drugs</course_title><school>School:  Colgate University</school><review_data_id>120564</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Kevin Morice</reviewer_name><other_review_count>30</other_review_count><other_course_completed>22</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/kevin12</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-04-21</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>There is some inherent bias in the course delivery. It isn't 'anti-drug' but it does definitely set out a stall early on about the limitations of drug-only treatment. By week 3 it gets a bit repetitive. Even to the point of re-using the same clips from the same interviews to make the same point. Having cleared those points the basic material is good, the course leader's delivery is a maybe a little slow but that is easily remedied by turning the speed up on your playback device.

High lack of didactic in the explanations. - Low quality videos with a lack of explanations of the important concepts. - Although the description states that there is no prerequisites, you must be already an engineer or engineering student to understand many of the videos and be able to solve the exercises. Furthermore there is absolutely no explanations on how to solve any of the exercises at all. Collaboration with other students on the forum is needed to be able to solve the problems and the use of many external resources as books or other university slides. - The weekly tests have neither any explanation about the solutions after the student have taken the test. Therefore it is impossible to learn why your answer was wrong. Also in many occasions these questions had no relation with the associated videos or the weekly content at all. - Tons of problems regarding the information uploaded to the course: exercise with wrong solutions uploaded or format error (use of comma for decimals instead of point symbol), expected units for solutions sometimes not indicated, etc. - Unidirectional formation with lack of support from the staff or desire to receive feedback from the students in any form. In general it seems there is no much interest or effort by the staff in creating a high quality course. - Just after the last day of the course, the staff completely removed all the tests, problems and -all the forum content- from the website. Are they planning to reuse the problems in the next course instead of developing new ones? Curso de muy baja calidad en casi todos los aspectos. - Mal estructurado y sin definir claramente los objetivos y los conceptos clave que se deberían conocer. Se centra demasiado en análisis. Explicaciones poco didácticas. - Baja calidad de los videos. No se explican los conceptos más importantes correctamente. Son poco útiles. - A pesar de que en la descripción se indica que no son necesarios conocimientos previos, en realidad se debe ser ingeniero o estudiante de ingeniería para ser capaz de resolver los ejercicios. Además no hay ningún tipo de explicación sobre cómo resolver ninguno de los ejercicios. Es necesario colaborar con otros estudiantes para encontrar la manera, así como utilizar material externo como libros o apuntes de otras universidades. - Los test semanales no tienen ninguna explicación sobre la solución correcta después de resolverlos. Por tanto es imposible aprender el por qué de las respuestas. Además en ocasiones hubo preguntas de test que no tenían ninguna relación con el contenido semanal o con los videos asociados. Las preguntas de test no siempre se centran en los conceptos importantes. - Muchísimos problemas con la información subida a la web: hubo ejercicios con las soluciones subidas incorrectamente (uso de la coma como separador decimal en lugar del punto, lo que generaba problemas informáticos al introducir el estudiante los resultados), unidades esperadas como solución de los ejercicios no indicadas en ocasiones, etc. - Formación unidireccional con falta de apoyo por parte del profesorado, con dificultades para recibir feedback por parte de los estudiantes. En general parece que hay poco interés o esfuerzo por parte del profesorado en generar un curso de calidad. - El último día del curso el staff se apresuró a eliminar por completo los test de autoevaluación, problemas y el contenido completo del foro, imposibilitando que esta información pueda ser reutilizada posteriormente. ¿Acaso planean utilizar los mismos problemas en próximas ediciones, en lugar de generar nuevos problemas o preguntas?</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45204</course_id><course_title>Introducción a la Ingeniería del Helicóptero</course_title><school>School:  Open Education Consortium</school><review_data_id>74880</review_data_id><reviewer_name>cortes ramirez</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-05-23</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>very well</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45204</course_id><course_title>Introducción a la Ingeniería del Helicóptero</course_title><school>School:  Open Education Consortium</school><review_data_id>74789</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-05-20</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>Little teaching, wrong set and/or instructions of execises, even with answers corresponding to diferent questions, lot of course configuration problems, lack of some stated materials, and total non-attendance of staff in forums.

The course content (Book) was available electronic format thus easy to carry and peruse. Additional reading material provided good food for thought. The instructors were extremely capable in drawing out the points of discussion helping enrich the reading experience. The course was beautifully balanced over 4 weeks giving the participants ample time to read the book (if this was their first time) and participate in the discussions. The course provider gets 5 stars because I could sit in India and enjoy being part of an international book club. It was unimaginable few years back.

Unfortunately, I had to go over data structures and algorithms - two topics which I'm fairly familiar with, but I guess the overview kept me up to speed in any case. Otherwise, most of this information in this course I found to be brand new. I think that I have a very good conceptual grasp of not only which machine learning methods are out there but how some of them work and what they're good at doing. I think that this was an excellent course for anyone who's interested in machine learning and needs somewhere to start. I don't have any prior experience in machine learning other than some articles on the internet and a high school background in computer science. I found the professors in this course more interesting or funny than the ones in Statistical Thinking, so that was a plus as well, although this could be skewed by the fact that I knew less about the material at hand than I did with Statistical Thinking.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26687</course_id><course_title>Light, Spike, and Sight: The Neuroscience of Vision</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>118874</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Gary Chen</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-02-28</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Just like what Mr.Claudio Felicioli said, this class is a little hard to rate. The advantage of this course is that it can definitely grab young students' interests for a long period of time. However, the disadvantage is that there are too many disturbances like the background musics; the background musics and different colorful cartoons may help the students to concentrate in a certain level and listen to the teachers. Unfortunately, these beautiful musics and cartoon may become disturbances if a student wants to focus 100 percent. In conclusion, I can definitely see that the Ms. Claire E. O'Connell, Mr. Nathan Kit Kennedy, Mr. Sebastian Seung, and Mr. Julian Samal put an abundant amount of efforts into this course; but this course's musics and cartoons actually improve the difficulty of concentrating and difficulty of remembering the materials. Except all of these disadvantages, this course is good for children to watch because it can easily absorb children's attentions.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26687</course_id><course_title>Light, Spike, and Sight: The Neuroscience of Vision</course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>115684</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Claudio Felicioli</reviewer_name><other_review_count>58</other_review_count><other_course_completed>58</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/claudio8</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-11-16</review_date><review_value>1</review_value><review>This course is difficult to rate: in my personal experience, it was the worst experience at all in the MOOCs I have signed in. The instructor is too much young to be reasonably near to having a suitable professor-level of experience in the topic. The content is embarrassingly lacking and mixed with young funky media nonsense. Any scientific course should teach not only bare information, but scientific way of thinking, and this course actually try to degrade your way of thinking! On the other hand, even if my personal experience was terrible (I'm not able to explain myself why I didn't dropped it, usually in bad courses I drop after a pair of weeks), there is something to note. I think the problem with this MOOC is that the target audience is late-primary or early-secondary education stage. It should be clearly stated in the description. The problem is not the quality of the course itself: it is very intelligently designed to be funny and to keep the attention high. I genuinely hated the way Claire O'Connell conducted the teaching, but she is really a very gifted communicator, and probably she is terrific in teaching to a different target. Probably I would have loved it when I was 9-13 years old, I'm really sorry for the bad review.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69967</course_id><course_title>Developing Dynamic Web Applications using Angular 2</course_title><school>School:  Microsoft</school><review_data_id>123578</review_data_id><reviewer_name>David Kocur</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-08-08</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>I like the course, but it feels incomplete. I completed the entire course in 3 days at a pace of about 4 hours per day. Routing is not covered, despite being mentioned in the welcome message from the course "host". I also think that the "host" abandoned the course. There are plenty of unanswered questions in the discussion forum (questions about the course, that only the "host" could answer), and when they had problems with grading the homework, they simply made the homework optional rather than fix the problem. To top it all off, the course has five modules and is supposed to have 5 assessments, one for each module. The problem is that there is no 5th assessment, so your max grade is an 80. Not that it's a big deal, because it was pretty easy to get an 80. The assessment questions are too easy. After the first module I started answering as many of the assessment questions as I could BEFORE starting the module to see what I needed to focus on.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69967</course_id><course_title>Developing Dynamic Web Applications using Angular 2</course_title><school>School:  Microsoft</school><review_data_id>122298</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Bhushan Dod</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-06-29</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Most awaiting course which I will eagerly waiting to pursue.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69529</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Engineering</course_title><school>School:  University of Texas at Arlington</school><review_data_id>122048</review_data_id><reviewer_name>student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-06-21</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>There are several things wrong with this course.

Video lectures are well produced and clearly explained -- about 60 minutes each week, broken into 5-10 minute blocks, with a PDF file also available containing all the formulas that are used in each lecture. This is followed by quiz questions and online MATLAB exercises. The first two weeks were straight-forward. Then the course became very difficult with a lot of trigonometry and complex numbers, moving forward at a fast pace and I had trouble fully understanding all the concepts. The online discussion forum was not very active, so there was not much help there. The final week was an exam which I found very difficult and some questions I simply could not answer.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>65214</course_id><course_title>Just Money: Banking as if Society Mattered </course_title><school>School:  MIT</school><review_data_id>120577</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Hjalmar Hernandez</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-04-21</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>Pienso que sera de mucho provecho para dar al dinero su lugar en la sociedad. pienso que el dinero utilizado de forma prudente, transparente y equitativo puede cambiar de forma positiva la calidad de vida de nuestra sociedad</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69237</course_id><course_title>Smart Cities</course_title><school>School:  ETH Zurich</school><review_data_id>122682</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Lalith kumar</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-07-12</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>i studied various articles about smart cities projects in India as a new initiatives ,this course will also benefit students of upsc and telangana state govt job aspirants</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>71509</course_id><course_title>AP® Physics 1: Challenging Concepts</course_title><school>School:  Davidson Next</school><review_data_id>123382</review_data_id><reviewer_name>doha said</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-08-03</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>because i think the most important thing to speak english very well is to have these skills very good</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>48816</course_id><course_title>Designing Advanced Applications using XAML</course_title><school>School:  Microsoft</school><review_data_id>114470</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Oluwatosin Ekundayo</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-10-19</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>I think this is great and perfect for the beginners, learning is good and i am appreciating the content, instructor and the provider. thank you</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>48823</course_id><course_title>Algèbre Linéaire (Partie 3)</course_title><school>School:  École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</school><review_data_id>116360</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Khalil BOUANANI</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-12-03</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>agé de 51 ans ayant appris des mathématiques dans mon cursus universitaire je souhaite rprendre cette discipline pour le plaisir.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>34584</course_id><course_title>DOCUMENTAL!

Or as a suggestion since the final assignment includes a more practical part to focus more on how actually to do the documentary film, how to solve the inevitable problems during the process, etc.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>47118</course_id><course_title>Programación Orientada a Objetos</course_title><school>School:  MéxicoX</school><review_data_id>114618</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-10-22</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>El contenido aunque fue básico es bueno para personas que comienzan a ver el lenguaje, sin embargo, el problema de las evaluaciones la cual no permite a nadie aprobar el curso deja mucho que desear de los administradores del curso y de la plataforma.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>47118</course_id><course_title>Programación Orientada a Objetos</course_title><school>School:  MéxicoX</school><review_data_id>114591</review_data_id><reviewer_name>student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-10-21</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>Muy pobre curso en todos los aspectos: temas que no dejaban claros, evaluación deficiente, pero sobre todo la poca dedicación al seguimiento del curso.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>47118</course_id><course_title>Programación Orientada a Objetos</course_title><school>School:  MéxicoX</school><review_data_id>114507</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Francisco Javier Ruiz García</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-10-20</review_date><review_value>1</review_value><review>Curso ciertamente lamentable, tanto en cuanto a su contenido, (ciertamente muy pobre) como, sobretodo y especialmente, en cuanto a su seguimiento, resolución de dudas del alumnado y, consecuentemente, el total abandono del mismo por parte de los docentes.

You will not leave this course with any more skills than you brought to it. I would only recommend this course as a survey of the discipline of Machine Learning and some of it's principles. I would DEFINITELY NOT pay for the certificate for this or the X-series as I did. Worst $350 I ever spent. Reasons below. As with the rest of the courses in the X-series, this course was poorly conceptualized, organized - executed. The material veered wildly from rudimentary to overly complex (- inadequately covered) to often entirely irrelevant (no one will be taking this course to learn basic genetics, yet there were several lectures and quizzes covering it). The assessments (again, like the rest of this series) were often wrong, and more often so poorly worded as to be impossible to discern the actual question. Sometimes the assessments covered material not even covered in the lecture or reading material. Some of these were acknowledged by the course staff and some questions had to be discounted or supplemented by extra credit questions added to the end of the course. This was also the case in the previous (first) course in the X-series. Hopefully this will be fixed in subsequent offerings, but it was an issue in all 3 courses of the series, and no effort seems to have been made to improve it throughout those offerings. The staff also did not do a very good job of managing the discussion board or being responsive. All that said, there were some good info and lectures, and CUx's video lecture technology is the best I've seen. If just watching the videos as a sort of introduction to the practices and principles of the discipline, it can be enjoyable and even a bit illuminating. But don't expect to leave with any practicable skills. And definitely don't expect a proper educational experience.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>68514</course_id><course_title>Machine Learning for Data Science and Analytics</course_title><school>School:  Columbia University</school><review_data_id>119089</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Daniela Kruse</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-03-04</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>This course is not what it wants to be: First 2.5 weeks are a repetition of algorithms 101 followed by an introduction to genetics. The final 2 weeks are about machine learning. In the algorithms part, there is some code but for the interesting part, there is just some explanation about the statistics behind and the algorithm names. The questions after first 2 weeks are mostly about vocabulary intepretation and partially even about genetics and preterm birth without any relation to algorithms or machine learning. The answers were sometimes wrong, the reaction to complaints was slow if it happened at all. In the end, the passing grade was reduced to 50% due to this. For two of the topics, the instructors where really difficult to understand due to their accent and mostly bad microphones. The captions were no help as they said "inaudible". This course was a waste of time. I continued till the end because I was hoping that there is yet something to come. I have a masters degree in computer science and apart from some unexplained statistics and algorithm names, there was nothing new.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>68514</course_id><course_title>Machine Learning for Data Science and Analytics</course_title><school>School:  Columbia University</school><review_data_id>119814</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-03-26</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>I completed this course because I had already paid for it.

I believe such a course fills an important need, bridging several disciplines to convey the message that IoT is very much the backbone of data science, much more than simply an infrastructure supporting such things as Home and Industrial Automation. That being said, the actual execution of the course (as a MOOC) doesn't quite achieve these aims. As other reviewers have noted, there are several areas of the course - content, structure, delivery and assessment - that could benefit from changes. Importantly, these suggested changes are to improve the course in its incarnation as a MOOC, not as a course for a smaller, quite learned, graduate school audience. Given the diversity of content, more focus could be achieved by including more unifying lectures where the aim is to more effectively tie the disparate topics together thus providing a broader context into which they would fit. Some of the more challenging content could be perhaps be removed, or presented as optional material. Assessment could be altered. One approach would be to maintain the quiz-only approach, but expand it to two quiz levels; ordinary quizzes based exclusively on presented content, and more challenging, but optional, quizzes which would include thinking-outside-the-box questions, and more demanding problems. I recall completing a Coursera MOOC (Nanotechnology: The Basics) in which this approach was very effectively used. Another approach (as suggested by another reviewer) would be to include challenges involving programming or similar problem solving, perhaps as a peer review challenge. Finally, timely staff monitoring and response (often by TA's or equivalent) of discussion forums in such MOOC's (technical content) is quite important, and, in these days where MOOC's are no longer a novelty, but have become a mainstream educational resource, expected by students. I, myself, had a very positive experience with the course, and look forward to seeing it better succeed.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>68512</course_id><course_title>Enabling Technologies for Data Science and Analytics: The Internet of Things (Past Run)</course_title><school>The Internet of Things is rapidly growing.

This course was a great refresher for me, and I found it amazing to learn what has happened in the field over the past 30 years. Not just faster computers able to handle the algorithms we studied and designed at the time, but truly new approaches. The IoT topics (networks and platform economics) were interesting too. The course touched on a variety of topics and the style and organization of teaching reminded me of the courses in Delft 30 years ago - not much difference or development in teaching over that period!

I was graded half marks on a word count when my word count on the essay was exactly right. Nothing fair about that. Other courses have been more fair in limiting random student grading to 10% so the impact of unfair grading would be minimal. Not here.

The course is merely lectures delivered by the professor with discussion with what appear to be his graduate students at the end of most lessons. There are no interactive activities, readings or anything else to really engage students, just three questions at the end of each set of lessons. There have been several occasions where the answers were not to be found in the lessons (especially week 9) or were so embedded that one had to be like Sherlock Holmes to find the answer. There has been almost no use of the discussion groups. No reading of the primary source (even in translation), inconsistent translations and when they made a mistake in coding the deadline for some of the exercises, no response (within 48 hours as of the typing of this review) was given by the admin personnel of the course. I am really disappointed by this as I was really looking forward to this course. I am working on the final exam now and will complete it, but I doubt I will take another mooc from Qinghua University.

It started very promising with fascinating lectures albeit with way too easy exercises (which I can attribute to the introductory scope of the course). However half way through, the entire course was abandoned, a third of the homework was not even posted and the instructors were nowhere to be seen. Overall this course may have suffered from being too ambitious but in the end looks more unfinished than Windows ME.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>51358</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Statistical Methods for Gene Mapping</course_title><school>School:  Kyoto University</school><review_data_id>120134</review_data_id><reviewer_name>student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-04-06</review_date><review_value>5</review_value><review>Actually an introductory level course containing very superficial (and insufficient) explanation of testing statistical hypothesis.

The Professor was not approachable or even able to answer important questions on the course. It was obvious that no TA or so on was actually on this course. The content was fine but very broad and vague. No recommended books were given even though asked for. Many other EDX courses have extensions as people do confuse deadlines. This course didn't. The first time it did. This seriously hindered some of the actual students who did the work properly not writing weird one liners that made no sense (but who will get full marks regardless for handing something.) Overall this course is propagandist, no pointers to other resources given and no flexibility or help. DO not do these topics.

In my experience random marks serve little academic purpose and can by insulting and demotivating.

It's an absolute lie that the prerequisites are high school math and programming. This course require deep knowledge of Electrical Engineering to know what's going on. And if you do have that background, then this course is not useful beyond a superficial familiarity with the acronyms. It will only be a high level regurgitation of topics already defined in EE courses. Week 1 is basically a brutal test of endurance. The professor is just reading the slides. I skipped it and will skip week 2 as well. Week 3 has two lectures that seem interesting to me about embedded systems. Going for the high level overview of IOT was an excellent idea. A course that provides a high level overview is crucially and desperately needed. The execution however is lacking so far. Lying about the required prerequisites of the course makes me doubt the integrity of whoever wrote that.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>46992</course_id><course_title>ETV: Paludismo, Dengue y Chikungunya</course_title><school>School:  MéxicoX</school><review_data_id>113244</review_data_id><reviewer_name>veronica llumiquings</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-09-20</review_date><review_value>1</review_value><review>Es muy importante para la identificacion de esta patologia en la.medicina rural ennmi pais.

I don't normally write course reviews until all the course content is available, but I feel compelled to write this review early (after the 3rd week of 6) because the course is diverging from my expectations so I may not finish it. I love to play board games and have designed a few board/card games in the past that never really got off the ground. I signed up for this course with the hope that it might help me improve a game I'm working on. The course description and promo video suggest that it would mainly focus on general game mechanics, prototyping and play testing, with little to no mention of video games outside of some digital prototyping. The first 3 weeks give some attention to both board games and video games, but the course is focusing more and more on video games with each successive week. The majority of guest speaker time and homework project time is devoted to digital games. The final 3 weeks cover digital prototyping, user interfaces and the business of games, which are likely to be heavily skewed toward video games over board games. Intro to game design has good content and for someone interested in making digital games, it would probably be a great course. Its main failing is that it didn't make it clear ahead of time that the focus of the course was going to be digital games. As it stands now, the course tries to split time and assignments between board and video games, which is not ideal. There are sections that are useful for board game designers here and there but it is getting difficult to weed through all the video-game oriented content.

I took it sometime last year prior to having any experience with programming or even a basic understanding of computing technology. Through out the course, the professor and staff were very helpful and made the process of learning very easy. After this course I've gone and learned many programming languages and created many apps. I honestly believe that if you start learning programming in any programming language with out the understanding of the fundamentals of computing technology like the one you would obtain from this course, you would be doing your self a disservice.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69215</course_id><course_title>The Computing Technology Inside Your Smartphone</course_title><school>School:  Cornell University</school><review_data_id>121053</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Fardim Kaiser</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-05-12</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I DROPPED THE COURSE LAST TIME DUE TO TIME SHORTAGE BUT BY GRADE WAS 51 PERCENT.

I don't normally write course reviews until all the course content is available, but I feel compelled to write this review early (after the 3rd week of 6) because the course is diverging from my expectations so I may not finish it. I love to play board games and have designed a few board/card games in the past that never really got off the ground. I signed up for this course with the hope that it might help me improve a game I'm working on. The course description and promo video suggest that it would mainly focus on general game mechanics, prototyping and play testing, with little to no mention of video games outside of some digital prototyping. The first 3 weeks give some attention to both board games and video games, but the course is focusing more and more on video games with each successive week. The majority of guest speaker time and homework project time is devoted to digital games. The final 3 weeks cover digital prototyping, user interfaces and the business of games, which are likely to be heavily skewed toward video games over board games. Intro to game design has good content and for someone interested in making digital games, it would probably be a great course. Its main failing is that it didn't make it clear ahead of time that the focus of the course was going to be digital games. As it stands now, the course tries to split time and assignments between board and video games, which is not ideal. There are sections that are useful for board game designers here and there but it is getting difficult to weed through all the video-game oriented content. The course would be better split into 2 courses, one for board/card game design and one for digital game design.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>70683</course_id><course_title>Financial Accounting</course_title><school>School:  ACCA</school><review_data_id>122128</review_data_id><reviewer_name>MD NAZIM UDDIN AL AZAD Azad</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-06-23</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course is very useful for any student of accounting.I want to do this course.I am bangladeshi.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>70683</course_id><course_title>Financial Accounting</course_title><school>School:  ACCA</school><review_data_id>122060</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Juliana França</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-06-21</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>I'm looking for of new knowledge!

The content is incredibly well structured - a focus on four main topics (Mars, Giant planets, small bodies, and life) for two or three weeks each allowed going into depth on each of the topics, while remaining accessible to newcomers (I, for example, had not done physics since high school). I loved the presentation style - Mike Brown is an excellent instructor, and I prefer the simple style of the lectures, where he talks and draws on the whiteboard, to the often overloaded style of other MOOCs. Sometimes, the lecture is interrupted by short questions on the current topic, which really helped my understanding of the issue at hand. The occasional guest lecturers were also all engaging and clearly experts in their fields. In short, a fantastic course which I would recommend to everyone with an interest in astronomy.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16063</course_id><course_title>The Science of the Solar System</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>123469</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-08-05</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>To be blunt, I'm a novice with only a non-parallel undergraduate degree acquired almost 40 years ago.

The course is fast-paced with 8-16 hours of workload for me (mostly for the assignments). The videos are pretty clear, but because the concepts are pretty difficult I had to watch some of them many times. The learning is reinforced by weekly assignments. The solutions from peers became progressively better over the first half of the course, probably because of student attrition. This course does require some hard work to follow. For me the interpreter and double dispatch assignments were the hardest. This course is unique in using three languages, which takes the attention away from a specific language, and make people focus more on the computational concepts. The concepts covered are close to the ones covered in SICP (http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/).</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>418</course_id><course_title>Linear and Integer Programming</course_title><school>School:  University of Colorado Boulder</school><review_data_id>114073</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Kristina Šekrst</reviewer_name><other_review_count>64</other_review_count><other_course_completed>64</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/sekrst</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-10-08</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I have to agree that this is one of the best courses offered.

I always wanted to learn more about the Simplex algorithm, and the lectures and the quizzes helped a lot in visualizing the problems, and with learning interesting new optimizations.

The course focuses on teaching the simplex method for optimizing systems linear equations with constraints for the first 4 weeks and then covers integer programming and applications. You should be comfortable with basic linear algebra and calculus before taking this course. The course includes optional programming assignments that allow students to build up their own simplex algorithms over the course of the class, but you can easily pass the course just taking the weekly quizzes. Linear and Integer Programming does an admirable job tacking a dense, dry subject. The instructors are easy to understand and explain confusing concepts well. The presentation style and video quality seem a bit dated, but it doesn't detract much from the learning experience. I must admit that my interest waned as the course went on because I took it due to curiosity than rather than a preexisting interest in the subject. That was a mistake. You should not take this course for fun; take it if you really want to learn about linear programming and have the time to get through all the lectures, supplementary materials and programming assignments. Overall, Linear and Integer Programming is a great course if you want to learn about the simplex algorithm in depth and understand important considerations and applications of linear and integer programming.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>418</course_id><course_title>Linear and Integer Programming</course_title><school>School:  University of Colorado Boulder</school><review_data_id>67376</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Kristina Šekrst</reviewer_name><other_review_count>8</other_review_count><other_course_completed>7</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/kristinasekrst</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-01-05</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review/><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>62</course_id><course_title>Medical Neuroscience</course_title><school>School:  Duke University</school><review_data_id>123504</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-08-06</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Having no medical background or school qualifications , this is my second attempt at this fantastic course ,Professor len White is amazing , i suspect he is really a robot lol as his knowledge is incredicble , and the laid back way he presents the course is 1st class,as is the structure and format of courseras. Presentation , the content and video presentation together with lab are second to none This year is my 2nd attempt and i have passed 5 weeks so far ,so if i can do it anyone can ....

The large international community of learners is really friendly and motivated, too, so as a bonus, you may find new friendships. Dr. White (Len) needs to be a name as familiar to neuroscience as Dr. Goljan to pathology or Dr. Fischer to internal medicine, and you will see why when things just click in your head and when you finish with more understanding than from other courses; he is just such a great teacher. A glimpse of his brilliance as an instructor is when a learner walks away successfully with the knowledge of a medical student and can apply that to research or a clinical situation. The examples that Professor White lectures stuck in my head; the pictures he selects or the ones he draws are easy to recall. Neuroscience is a visual subject as much as it is knowledge-based, and this course stresses and utilizes both. Professor’s White unique talents are 1) to seamlessly repeat an important concept always in a fresh way and 2) to predict the learners’ struggles and confusions and address them. It is no wonder that students at his school honored Len with prestigious teaching awards. You can easily see Dr. White’s excitement for neuroscience and his passion for teaching. Simply a blessing that most of the world is free to learn from him. Two other rare features stand out about this course: heavily involved teaching assistants, such as Ellen, and detailed unit notes. In summary, while this is the most demanding and lengthy course on Coursera (I felt the speed of the course was just right), it is also the most rewarding. Duke University has continuously proved to be a great school to take class via Coursera.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>196</course_id><course_title>Archaeology's Dirty Little Secrets</course_title><school>School:  Brown University</school><review_data_id>111623</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Joanna</reviewer_name><other_review_count>6</other_review_count><other_course_completed>6</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/tzigi</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-08-15</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I loved this MOOC, I had great fun doing it.

I was kind of apprehensive in the beginning, since it deals with religion. In reality, I was very pleasantly surprised with the tone of the course. The lectures are neutral and balanced. This is about History, not Theology. It presents an overview of the way the jewish Bible was produced, the reasons behind it and the society of the time, as well as what we can learn and take away from it. There are very few negatives. Maybe the course could be a bit longer (6 weeks is nothing). Maybe the quizzes could be a bit more challenging - a peer- reviewed assessment could help. There is mandatory forum participation worth 5% of the grade, which I hate - in courses such as this you really need to stay away from the forum (which is true always, but courses involving religious topics make particularly irritating and worthless forum discussions). Finally, I personally felt a bit lost in the segments sometimes; sometimes I felt the narrative in the lecture wasn't very clear. However, the course is so good that these negatives are pretty small if you look at the big picture. I couldn't recommend this course more if this is a topic that appeals to you.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>12677</course_id><course_title>The Bible's Prehistory, Purpose, and Political Future</course_title><school>School:  Emory University</school><review_data_id>37394</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Doug Jantz</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>0</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/dwjantz</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-06-30</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I will highly recommend this course to others when offered again.  The material is that which many need to know for a greater understanding of the Bible in its own setting and origins.  Much of this was new to me and the reading recommendations were priceless as were all the class videos.  Dr Wright has hit a home run in my opinion and I am sure future courses from him will be even more so.  Thanks!!!</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>12677</course_id><course_title>The Bible's Prehistory, Purpose, and Political Future</course_title><school>School:  Emory University</school><review_data_id>37390</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Catherine Girard</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>0</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/catherinegirard</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-06-30</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I wrote an earlier review, but it has not come up on the posts.

I have a background in Computer Sciences and some amateur electronics experience (including an amateur radio extra license). I wanted to get some theory to strengthen my understanding of electric signals, radio waves, etc. It exceeded my expectations. Professor Don Johnson excels at explaining those complicated concepts and he slowly walked us from basic trigonometry to signal propagation with a glimpse of maxwell equations. I had several ha-ha moments in this class. I am afraid I will quickly forget some of the maths without practice but I know many concepts will stay. Amongst my favorites moments: * Demonstrating why impedance works and now knowing why it can only work for sine-shaped signals * Superposition principle: first used to simplify analysis of circuits with two sources and then later applying it to radio signals (because Maxwell equations are linear ;) * Finally understanding how a Fourier transform works and really grasping it through lots of exercises on the subject * Why we now have digital everywhere and why it is replacing analog transmissions * Understanding why a Software-Defined-Radio needs an I/Q (inphase+quadrature) output of the signal And so much more ... I highly recommend it but be warned, you will be challenged, you will have to seriously brush up your maths, and it will remain challenging all the way through the 12 weeks. I think I easily spent 10 hours a week on this course after week 3. I have only one critic: the grading system really did not work that well for maths equations. The formulas are often very complicated and can be expressed in different forms. Sometimes you would have the right answer but it would not be accepted because the grader expected something different. The forums helped a lot but I really hope this improves for the next session. One final advice: use the textbook. I only started looking at it at week 4 or 5 and I should have started earlier.

The instructor talked clearly and with humor, gave lots of options to watch/read video lectures, gave links to more stuff on the web for those who want and have more time to read. Discussions brought a lot of ideas, considerations, findings - an effect of massiveness. The instructor was involved in the course - participated in forums, wrote announcements. Peer assesment was an interesting exercise. Before the course, I expected that I'll be forced to go out with my GPS receiver and record stuff in the field - I wasn't, but it was an option. It's OK too, just different from what I thought. I found discussion assignment themes in forums to be too weekly organized - I'd liked a subforum per theme (if somebody wants to say about multiple themes, he/she may post to main forum for the discussion). Mapping assignments took a lot of time from me to do. Maybe they could be shorter? It would be good to know required final mapping assignment scope - this one took a lot of time from me too, but I've seen much shorter stories made by peers. Shortcomings were minor and I'm happy I took this course. I'd like to see more introductory courses, in any area, so well organized. The instructor made great job, the provider was good and was not getting in the way of learning process.

Personally I feel the course could have been completed in 2 - 3 weeks if several topics had not been stretched out so much. Also I thought the mapping assignments were very poorly designed and difficult to do. From an ergonomic and visual POV, they were a pain. I had to keep on flipping between the extremely verbose instructions and the less than appealing GUI of the external map providers (ESRI, ARGCIS, etc). I would have preferred this to have been shown as another video so that I could digest the information in one shot without having to constantly lose focus by shifting from instructions to map and back. Doing problems by oneself is good in Maths but for using a tool, simple spoon-feeding would have been better. To judge if someone really understood how to use those map tools, simple questions could have been included in the weekly quizzes. I feel bad being so negative about this one sore point I have and I would like to thank the course makers for the huge amount of knowledge I gained by going through this course. I completed all quizzes albeit after the hard deadline. Thanks to my OCD I did not skip even those painful mapping assignments :-P !</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>379</course_id><course_title>Maps and the Geospatial Revolution</course_title><school>School:  The Pennsylvania State University</school><review_data_id>74623</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-05-14</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>No previous knowledge is required for this course, only to be passionate with maps.

The course was well organised. The videos had a good pace, good content and were good quality. The weekly assignments put into practice what I had just learned in the videos and I had to think hard to solve the assignments. The software installation and automated submission and marking of assignments worked for me without any problems. The discussion forum was active. It seemed like a lot of people were taking the course. The only negatives were that I found about 10% of course to be theoretical (Induction proof) and not really of practical use, and I spent about 10 hours per week on the course, not the estimated 5-7 hours (mostly because the assignments were difficult).</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>103</course_id><course_title>Functional Programming Principles in Scala</course_title><school>School:  École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</school><review_data_id>52618</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Francois Fernando</reviewer_name><other_review_count>5</other_review_count><other_course_completed>3</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/francoisfernando1</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-08-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The best class I have taken on programming.

This combination provokes your procrastination, but please beware: "nah, I'll do it all in a last week" attitude will fail you, because you will probably need 2 to 3 weeks of full-time engagement to complete the course, better spread them throughout full course duration. Instructor did an amazing job to present the material.

Overall, I've learned from the combination of Rabkin's lectures, the reading, and the requirement to write brief (320 word) essays. Each week Rabkin assigns a full book to read, along with the required essay (8 of 10 required for a statement of accomplishment), and 5 peer reviews (30-150 words on form and content for each essay). The video lectures (about 90 minutes of listening time, which can be reduced by speeding up playback) are topical and engaging, though a few contain factual errors about the stories. Unlike some professors (Al Fireis in Modern - Contemporary American Poetry), Rabkin shows no desire to interact with students, never participates in forum discussion, has no live webinars, and hasn't updated his lectures for a few years. However, if you want to approach fantasy and science fiction on a deeper level, his lectures will show you new insights into the work, and if you apply that level of reading to your own essays, you will gain a lot more from your reading. Peer reviews are, as expected from Coursera, a very mixed bag. They're rarely that insightful, in my experience. The essays you're required to grade are often poorly written, cobbled together work, frequently from students for whom English is a second or third language. While it's admirable that they're attempting the work, the time required to puzzle through the writing and the lack of insights most give to the reading, made peer review grading (for me) the absolutely biggest time waster and useless part of the course. One of the biggest negative surprises for me (and many others, based on forums postings) was the grading "scheme" for essays. There is a 3 point scale for form and content. Rabkin, the professor, states that a score of "2" on form and content means "successful" and that the essay is "smoothly written." But we all learned this week - at the END of the course - that awarding a "2" in the class's scoring scheme actually was the equivalent of a "D" - because a "2" in form and "2" in content gave you a "4" for the essay, or a 66% (a "D"). Most students in the class got scores below 80% because of the instructions in how to score. And despite emails to the professor during and after the class, he never responded. TA's that participated in the class stated that they had never had any contact with the professor. SO ... take it if you want to push yourself to read science fiction literature, and if you can learn from lectures and apply those to your own writing, but don't expect valuable peer feedback in general, and know that the scoring will give you a high likelihood of a low Coursera grade. On the plus side, no one in the entire market economy is going to give you a job or fire you because of a Coursera score.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>3</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45</course_id><course_title>Fantasy and Science Fiction: The Human Mind, Our Modern World</course_title><school>School:  University of Michigan</school><review_data_id>30836</review_data_id><reviewer_name>ShloEmi Ohayon</reviewer_name><other_review_count>12</other_review_count><other_course_completed>10</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/shloemi</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-05-05</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Outstanding, enriching, enlightening course IMO.

It provides best of quizzes, programming assignments and interview questions. It uses java as a vehicle language, however it doesn't use high level java specific features, so, if you know some other object oriented programming language then you are good to go. Using the book Algorithms by the professor Bob Sedwick and Kevin Wayne would also be helpful. Best part of this course is programming assignments. Don't miss them. CONS: Doesn't provide any certificate or even mark sheet( and rightly so). I believe that shouldn't be a concern if you are really motivated.

Some Algorithms courses focus on the analysis of algorithms and others focus on the design or implementation of algorithms. This course takes a very application approach to algorithms. Within a week of enrolling in this course, I was using its implementations for improving my programming for my job. For example, I learned how to analyze the memory usage of a program and used this to improve some software at my job. In addition, I have used the tools from this course to improve the efficiency of our algorithms. This alone made the course worth it. Pros: * Course is very application focuses and introduces the students to almost all the big topics in algorithms (unions, analysis of algorithms, graphs, string processing, sorting, searching and so forth) * Reading material, lecture notes and additional resources provide an excellent method for learning the material * Programming assignments give you a great understanding of the material * Instructors provide a very good approach to solving problems: define the problem, write out the API, develop the test client, visualize the algorithm, and break up the problem into small pieces to solve Cons: * Exercises and final exam are randomly generated and must be completely restarted after each attempt; 10 attempts and 3 attempts are allowed on the exercises and final exam, respectively. Slight mistakes are often not given partial credit and can take the fun out of learning. * Java coding practices are not followed (as mentioned by other reviewers). For example, variable and class names are often abbreviated. I am assuming the instructors did this to fit the code on the lecture slides so it is understandable, especially since all the variables are well defined. * Programming assignments can take a large amount of time (10 - 20 hours per week). While I did not mind this, be ready to spend a large amount of time on some of the assignments if you do not have extensive experience. The instructors could cut back on the amount of time spent by providing coding templates, more helper functions/methods and separating out the grading for different pieces of the code. * Dynamic programming is not a focus in this course (or the next). While it is mentioned informally, it seems like this topic should be considered for future offerings.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>1177</course_id><course_title>Moralities of Everyday Life</course_title><school>School:  Yale University</school><review_data_id>120893</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Greg van de Krol</reviewer_name><other_review_count>4</other_review_count><other_course_completed>4</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/greg30</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-05-05</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>We are very lucky that there are people like Prof. Bloom who will tackle such controversial topics in a worldwide open forum.

The content of the course is outstanding. There is a lot of useful information in one place here. 2. The assignments are useful. 3. Unfortunately, the organization of information in the assignment documents is frustrating and incoherent. It requires a lot of brain power just to figure out what they are saying. The first assignment, for example, is not terribly difficult, but the objective in the assignment is unclear which leaves a student fumbling around trying to figure out what needs to be done to complete the assignment. I left 3 starts for the instructor for not tightening up the assignments materials. Each assignment should be concise, have a clear goal, and provide a clear plan for accomplishing that goal. I believe that's what makes the difference between a good instructor and a great instructor. I also find the connection between the lectures and the assignments to be a bit too loose.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>22</course_id><course_title>Compilers</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>55622</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Daniel Savard</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>0</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/danielsavard</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-09-23</review_date><review_value>5</review_value><review>I expected to learn how to write a compiler, how to use the lexical analyzer, the parser and which algorithms are needed to produce executable code. I was taking this class because I did want to learn about parsing a language and integrates it into my programs. So, producing executable code was not really my goal. Parsing the language was what I was really seeking for. I did abandon this course before reaching my goal. I found the course frustrating. It requires much more time than expected and not enough examples and practical problems were give to make sure you master the concepts required. And partly, the choice to force you to learn a toy language and make a compiler for it was the problem. It is like teaching a language and assuming you are mastering it at the same time. It introduces unecessary complications. This course should be split in two, one part focusing on basic concepts without the COOL language and the goal to write a compiler for it. Then the second part, taught as a second course could have for sole goal to teach you the COOL language and guide you in writing a compiler for it. I found also the fora was not that helpful because that is a lot of extra readings you have to do beside everything else: flex, bison documentation, course documentation, COOL documentation, etc. Too much stuff at the same time. I am still seeking for a good course teaching this material, or at least language parsing. I haven't find anything yet.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>22</course_id><course_title>Compilers</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>35656</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Equanimous Creativity</reviewer_name><other_review_count>33</other_review_count><other_course_completed>32</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/equanimouscreativity</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-06-17</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>Do you want to know how a compiler works? or do you want to make your own general purpose programming language ?

It feels like we are only taught enough to implement the COOL language and the COOL language itself feels a little dated. Also the deadlines for midterm and final exam collide with deadlines for the programming assignments, making following the line with the programming assignments almost impossible for people which is not full-time students.

If I would ever end up a politician, i would make this course mandatory to pretty much most programs in college and university that have to do with politics, economics, finance, accounting. However, with very little background knowledge, I found the course very challenging. For me it mattered more to really understand every sentence and every reasoning, so I tried to go beyond just doing the quizzes, which I found inadequate. I also found that the pace of the course was too fast for me. I bought the book by the instructor and STigum's Money Market, but I was unable to read them at the same time. I would have loved to have had the course spread out over a few more weeks. The subject is complex, and having a solid base is very important, which I found cannot be done in 6-8 weeks. But other than that, i fully recommend the course and will redo it again during the next session to better my understanding of the material.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>3356</course_id><course_title>Economics of Money and Banking, Part One</course_title><school>School:  Columbia University</school><review_data_id>111969</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-08-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Amaizing piece of education with an engaging and super intelligent professor.

The course consists of 7 weeks of lecture content--typically three 8-20 minute videos per week--with a 8-10 question quiz for each video. The quizzes aren't too difficult and you get 2 attempts, but since there is one quiz for every lecture video, you'll be spending a significant proportion of your total class time answering quiz questions. The course doesn't get into network algorithms or computing: it focuses on basic network structure, formation and games, so you can take this course without any programming or math background. Networked life debuted about 2 years ago, making it among the first courses available on Coursera, so the presentation and slide quality are a bit dated. The lecturer mainly reads directly off slides and you spend the majority of lecture time looking at static slides written in Comic Sans as the lecturer explains them in greater detail. The information is solid and generally interesting but the presentation is often a bit dull when there are no illustrations on the screen. The quizzes are probably the best part of the course; even though they are easy they help reinforce the content and break what might otherwise become a tedious slog through lecture video after lecture video. The course is self- paced, so despite it having "7 weeks" of content, you can finish it faster if you want to. Networked life is an accessible introduction to networks and while the presentation isn't great, the topics are interesting and the frequent quizzes help keep you engaged.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>35</course_id><course_title>Networked Life</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>53445</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Richard Taylor</reviewer_name><other_review_count>29</other_review_count><other_course_completed>28</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/richardtaylor</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-09-10</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>A very nice introduction to neworks including social networks, models and economic networks with some game theory.

His only fault is his total lack of knowledge in the field of geography :) There are well designed quizzes to practice the content of each video lecture no programming, exams or any other assignments and the whole material is available from day 1 so you can really go at your own pace. I'd like to say something about the comments mentioning prof Kearns reading long slides. He is not reading, he uses the slides to highlight the topics he explains, the slides are very well constructed because they can be used as a summary of what was discussed in each lesson.

If it will be offered again (I wish!) the advice for those who wants to take it is to have the book as well (either the recommended one, or a free Introduction to Information Retrieval, written by Manning et al http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/ and to dedicate quite some time to this course, especially if you haven't been involved with NLP before. Programming experience is a must (the first offering used Python and Java), as well as some exposure to the probability theory. I have been going through Probabilistic Graphical Models at the same time, and these two courses slightly overlapped, though NLP can overlap with almost everything in Computer Science. All the assignments were using English texts as data. If you are interested in the automatic translation, have a look at another, more involved NLP course: https://class.coursera.org/nlangp-001/class/index . For most of the other NLP-relevant topics the course of Zhurafsky and Manning is a great starting point.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>3</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>122</course_id><course_title>Microeconomics Principles</course_title><school>School:  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</school><review_data_id>113785</review_data_id><reviewer_name/><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/dswallow4</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-10-01</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I really enjoyed the course.

The recommended reading- Prof Chamovitz' book "What a Plant Knows" is not absolutely necessary in order to pass the course.

An absolutely mind-opening course. One caveat...while the quizzes seemed pretty easy, the final was HARD. Be prepared to study...and take your time. Still, even with its difficulty, I managed to earn a certificate with distinction, the one I am most proud of because plants aren't in my career field of interest (medicine) and the professor set a very high bar to earn it (95%).

So, I won't repeat main points here (that is, course is great and of a very good quality). Topics covered in a second part are also extremely common and useful (i.e. string processing, REs, data compression), but there are also more advanced topics (i.e. graph processing, intractability). Graph theory is just 3 weeks, so it may seem like lots of new stuff to learn in such a short period of time, but there's one week break to catch up (that is nice). Overall this course took me more time to complete than the first part, and in the end I decided that I'll take a break with the algorithms for a while :) Well, for me there are almost no dislikes. Some algorithms (like linear programming and manber-myers) were covered briefly, but there were not really enough time for all of them. So I guess they are just topics for more advanced courses (i.e. like linear and integer programming or something) or self-study.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>31</course_id><course_title>Algorithms, Part II</course_title><school>School:  Princeton University</school><review_data_id>33002</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jim Humelsine</reviewer_name><other_review_count>7</other_review_count><other_course_completed>7</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/jimhumelsine</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-05-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Disclaimer - I audited this course. I watched every video, but I did not do the programming assignments. Algorithms Part II is a great follow up to Algorithms Part I. I just spent the past day review the slides and summarizing the topics of the course. I had forgotten how much material was covered. Rather than mastery, I'm focusing upon understanding. I'll consult the online materials when needed. I have two specific comments about the course: \+ I would like more examples on how to apply mincut/maxflow in graphs. I understand the theoretical concept and the algorithm, but I'm not sure how to apply it. I see how it was applied in the lecture examples, but there was no presentation on how one would recognize when a problem might be solved using mincut/maxflow and how one would go about converting a problem into a graph so as to solve it. \+ The optional Linear Programming section could have had a few more examples as well. I also have two policy comments: \+ Princeton does not offer Statements of Accomplishment. You won't even get a final grade. \+ The Algorithms' staff shuts down the site after a session is over, sometimes soon after a session is over. So if you want access to the materials you need to download the files, especially the videos. However, the staff does keep a lot of material available online outside of Coursera, including their online book and Java implementations of the algorithms.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>19</course_id><course_title>Computer Science 101</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>61058</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-12-01</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Really basic stuff but great for beginners and people with no previous knowledge about the subject.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>19</course_id><course_title>Computer Science 101</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>53444</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Dianne Owens</reviewer_name><other_review_count>30</other_review_count><other_course_completed>30</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/keikomushi</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-09-04</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course is a terrific introduction to the area of Computer Science, covering a wide range of topics, such as coding, security and hardware.

I am reviewing this after having finished the course requirements yesterday although the course is still technically not over. Positives - 1\. The course is hosted by two professors. Dr Richard and Dr. Seth. While Dr. Seth prefers to stay hidden behind his course material (his material is damn good though), it is Dr. Richard who is the face of the course and keeps you heavily engaged with his sheer passion and perspective. You instantly and instinctively know you are with an real subject matter expert and who enjoys doing what he does. He makes the course very very engaging. 2\. The course feels very comprehensive if you are getting into this domain for the first time. Perspectives on energy consumption and history / fossil fuels / science and history behind climate change / renewables / geoengineering / economics, policy and ethics behind tackling climate change. 3\. The course material is absolutely amazing. Many of the reading material / videos / url's that is shared gives you amazing insights and perspectives into the subject. What could be better? \- While taking the chapters on policy related issues, I felt that it would have been good to get some different perspectives too. Dr. Richard shares what is going on / options being discussed out there and also gives you some insights of what he believes are the best options to tackle climate change - but at times I felt his views may be too utopian / idealist. It would have been good to hear from a) politicians b) those who question / debate / delay action on climate change - this would have given us some perspectives on contrarian views / challenges being faced in getting the world to move fast and in sync. \- if in general, you dont like one person hogging the limelight, you may end up feeling you see too much of Dr. Richard in videos. However, trust me the course would not be half as good without him. One comment on the workload - Honestly, reading all the material / watching the videos / also going through useful links that got shared on the discussion forums by other students ends up taking fair bit of time. I think that if you want to just get by, you could speed read and do the bare minimum in about 4 hours a week. But if you are really here for the learning, it would definitely take longer. Also, the course duration is 8 weeks with couple of weeks being especially heavy. Also, for reasons of time, I did not attempt the certificate with distinction but just the plain version - that would add another hour or so per week. I am also taking another related course simultaneously ( still in week 7 out of total 11) - Global Sustainable Energy: Past, Present and Future. While there are some overlaps, largely I have found the course material so far complimentary. And that has helped me get more out from Coursera in this area. The best course so far for me on Coursera (this is my 3rd course). It sets up a good base before you want to deep dive into particular parts of this subject. Strongly recommend.

The first half and last lecture were cogent, well prepared and well assessed. The second half (less the last lecture) were inchoate, delivered ad hoc and assessed without relation to delivered material. Prof. Galitski's lectures were delivered with structure and clearly described the development of key concepts. Prof. Clark's lectures, on the other hand, can only be described as lazy: his hand annotations were illegible and his assessment portions seemed to assume that the students did the work of investigating the development of key concepts that he was too disinterested to develop. Overall, I cannot recommend this course.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>166</course_id><course_title>Exploring Quantum Physics</course_title><school>School:  University of Maryland, College Park</school><review_data_id>33426</review_data_id><reviewer_name>leonard mangini</reviewer_name><other_review_count>39</other_review_count><other_course_completed>37</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/leonardmangini1</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-06-21</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Excellent content, sophisticated delivery and well-planned pedagogy.

I am a graduate in physical chemistry and a bit familiar with quantum physics. The course shortly describes fundamental concepts of QM. Lecturers use advanced mathematics, but this math is not so difficult as used in real QM computations. In fact the course is the essence of quantum physics with a minimum of mathematics. And this course is hard by MOOC standards, not any can complete such course. But I personally would like more courses like this.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>12636</course_id><course_title>Logic: Language and Information 1</course_title><school>School:  The University of Melbourne</school><review_data_id>110212</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-06-30</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Excellent course, cannot recommend it highly enough. I did the whole course after it finished, so I wasn't able to do the peer assessments, or to participate as such in the forums (therefore can't comment on those aspects); but I watched all the video lectures, did all the practice / graded quizzes, read a lot of the course notes (gigantic PDF), and browsed the forums. Greg and Jen really know their stuff. Great delivery in the videos: clear explanations, numerous examples, and some humour thrown in occasionally too. I am in awe of the tremendous effort that obviously went in to just the videos (let alone the whole MOOC). I knew next to nothing about propositional logic before, and now I feel that I've absorbed all the basics. The material was quite challenging, but if you feel motivated, you can get through all the content and the assessments.

It was hard work though - most of the quizes involved a fair bit of work, like writing out proof trees. There is a peer graded exam, so you'll need to hope the people marking you understand the topic as well you do.

The readings which were required for this course were on the serious level, and the students had to write essays based on what they have read. (This was one of the first experiments with the peer grading, I think; I took the very first version of this course). Also, there were regular "live sessions" which included not only the Princeton students, but some of the MOOC learners. In other words, the course looked very much like "the real one". The professor was friendly and with a good sense of humor, combined with a substantial knowledge of his subject. As a result, the lectures were engaging and informative. Various aspects and problems of the social life were touched. Many of them were related to the American society in particular, but on the forums people were discussing how the ideas from the course could apply to their own communities. The interest and the level of participation was high, and I think this course was a big success. Would definitely recommend this course as an introduction to the subject.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>27</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Sociology</course_title><school>School:  Princeton University</school><review_data_id>933</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jasper Lim</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/jasperlim</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-02-11</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is the first course I took in Coursera.

The forums were constantly updated with new discussions. People were incredibly active on both G+ and Facebook study groups. It was great. I mention this course in other courses a lot because I think it did a lot of things right. There were weekly live seminars where the professor gathered 8 students from around the world and a couple of his student from Princeton and they discussed that week's coursework. I WISH other classes would do this. It makes it feel like it's a real class to have people interacting with it in real time. There were usually threads responding to the Google Hangout (which they used for the live seminar) in real time. I also liked that this course had reading that was substantial and felt representative of a real college course. Some courses on here just do the video lectures and I feel like they lack some depth. I honestly felt very intellectually challenged by this class.

I love the fact that the new lectures are being added for the second iteration, and I simply cannot praise enough the booklets that accompanied each lecture. One could just read these tutorials and feel like it's a lecture on its own. The only critique I have of this course is the lack of quizzes, since it's easy to fall behind, but the instructors preferred to stay within the traditional approach, as they have explained in the last video entry. Even though there are no quizzes, there are lots of problems to solve, and there are active discussion forums, so that fixes things a bit. This course gives a great blend of mathematics and philosophy, but it relies more heavily on the mathematical part and proofs, so this is a simple caveat.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>390</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy</course_title><school>School:  Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU)</school><review_data_id>44318</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Rafael V.

That may seem redundant, but it's the truth: the course does not aim to make of you a mathematical philosopher, but rather to showcase to you some of the main areas of the subject, covering each of them per week, mostly. The lectures are too much like a book, and a bit boring or confusing at times -even the teachers acknowledge that, and they said they planned to provide the students with written texts for the next offerings. But if you are patient and willing, you may get quite a lot out of it, and have a great time learning about questions you may or not ever have asked yourself (and if you did, you probably couldn't answer them, either!). It's overall a great experience, I think, for anyone interested in Math and Philosophy. However, despite the content being somewhat deep, passing the course is very easy. They chose to evaluate students through quizzes rather than written essays, which I find is a good thing (may I remind you that usually essays (and other more 'creative' work) in Coursera is often peer-graded, that is, you grade other student's works, who in turn grade yours, and usually no teacher or TA is involved in this process, which sometimes leads to unfairness). All in all, quizzes do make the course easier, but more fair.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>390</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy</course_title><school>School:  Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU)</school><review_data_id>41952</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jack Rogers</reviewer_name><other_review_count>15</other_review_count><other_course_completed>8</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/jackrogers</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-08-31</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course will begin on 29 July 2014, and I'm very thrilled to have finally found a course on ' MATHEMATICAL PHILOSOPHY '...!

The course has three parts: 1) Programming with Processing Processing is a visually-oriented programming language that allows you to very easily create multimedia content while retaining the freedom of computer programming. I had never had contact with it before, and found it amazing, which renewed my interest in digital art and ultimately led me to actually collaborate with other artists to create something that was eventually displayed at an expo. All this to say that this course can, indeed, serve as a serious start if you want to delve into computer arts. But it won't suffice: Processing (and this is true of the other modules as well) is only covered to a reasonable but small extent, and if you want to go further, you're on your own - but that's true of anything in life, isn't it? 2) Audio editing with Audacity and Soundation/Logic This was the most challenging part for me, as I had had zero experience with audio editing before. The lectures gave me quite a bit of new information regarding the nature of sound in analog and digital media, and how to manipulate those, but little to none information about how to create anything "musical" (which I still don't know how to do), so I mostly created experimental and noisy stuff. A few other more experienced students, I noticed, took more out of it, and went further to create some pretty amazing things, I remember. In some assignments you are required to create a "visual score" of your piece, which I personally found too demanding and not so much useful or interesting. 3) Image editing with Photoshop/GIMP I've been working with Photoshop for around seven years now, so this was the easiest module for me. The staff gave a fair overview of the program's main features concerning photo editing, but of course there is way much more about Photoshop (I don't think anyone knows how to make use of 100% of Photoshop, really). If you take this part seriously, you'll learn enough to make your vacation photos look way better, at least! However, no content regarding visual composition or aesthetics was provided, which resulted in some messy visual artwork from some students (akin to my noisy work in the audio section, I guess haha). Today the course is offered through three separate modules, but when I took it they were all together in one package. Makes little difference for the review, anyway.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>3360</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Computational Arts</course_title><school>School:  The State University of New York</school><review_data_id>4781</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Sandra</reviewer_name><other_review_count>3</other_review_count><other_course_completed>3</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/sandra1</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-01-08</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>This course had the potential to be really good.

It's here described: "Lectures will cover concepts and presentations of artists working in various capacities with computers, as well as tutorials on specific software packages." Well, there's very little of the former, very little aesthetic content, it consists mainly of (pretty clear) instructions on using the software and these are quite short most weeks. No-one seemed to have proof-read the assignments - quizzes and they were full of mistakes, omissions - conflicting instructions. This was compounded by the failure of the staff to monitor the forums on anything but a very occasional basis. The material was split into three parts, Processing, Photoshop/Gimp and Soundation/Audacity, of unequal size. Processing is the one where a beginner can produce the most impressive results but the number of weeks devoted to it was about half that devoted to Soundation/Audacity. The assessment was through very simple quizzes (sometimes insultingly simple, "Has your tutor pointed you at relevant examples?" The answer "Yes, lots" was apparently the correct one if you didn't want to throw away marks), assignments - three projects. The assignments varied hugely in their difficulty. Some should have been undertaken as basic technical exercises without assessment; others took a lot of effort, certainly as much as the projects, but each was worth less than a tenth of the marks for a project. Peer review had its usual problems but toward the end got especially difficult with some very odd submissions which might have been plagiarism or cynical attempts to satisfy the marking criteria without any creative effort. Anyway, don't let me put you off - the material is fun despite everything. The course may be split into separate streams for the three computational arts which might work better.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>3360</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Computational Arts</course_title><school>School:  The State University of New York</school><review_data_id>4687</review_data_id><reviewer_name>soesilo wijono</reviewer_name><other_review_count>19</other_review_count><other_course_completed>19</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/soesilowijono</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-05-15</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>For me this is an interesting and easy course, because I've ever taken another course on Processing, I'm familiar with Photoshop, only sound part is quite challenging for me but finally I found they're easy enough. Finishing this course to honing my artistic taste. The course has 3 parts, basic programming with Processing, basic images with Photoshop/GIMP, and basic sounds. I read in the announcement that the team will change this course to be taught into 3 parts, although I don't know what that means. Update: I see that for now this course has already splitted into smaller 3 courses. This course (first session) has longest duration, 15 weeks. There are peer graded assignments and very easy quizzes. All you need is time to finish this interesting course. And I was enjoying to see the PGA's artistic pieces shared by students in the forum.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>3360</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Computational Arts</course_title><school>School:  The State University of New York</school><review_data_id>4551</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Grace</reviewer_name><other_review_count>6</other_review_count><other_course_completed>5</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/grace</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-12-15</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>All of this for free? And whenever/wherever I want? Tim began the course by holding our hands through learning how to use the language/program named Processing. We used it to create simple geometric shapes at first, and then, a few weeks later, we were writing programs that someone else could use for drawing. Amazing! Tim passed us on to Catherine who likewise took us by the hand and gently walked us through using Photoshop and GIMP. She gave the same instruction using both platforms. We began by learning digital concepts, and touching up old, damaged photographs, and in a few weeks, we learned many techniques for using photographs to create composite images that supported profound statements. Next, our professor took us by the hand and led us step- by-step through using Audacity, Logic, and Soundation. Again, she showed us how to get great results from using free resources, and pointed out reasons why some of us might want to pay for the proprietary software. We began by creating simple mono sound recordings, like what I used to do with a tape recorder, and in a few weeks, moved us to composing music using numerous sound tracks, combining digital and audio sources, and making visual representations of our work. Finally, Tim returned and answered the question that had been burning in me: how would we combine these three skills into one final project? Throughout the course, we received clear instruction for how to upload our work to public websites. The discussion forums were full of people who had expertise in one area, and who relied on their classmates as they struggled through other topics. The sharing was wonderful, when it occurred. Unfortunately, near the end of the first section, plagiarism became a highly- publicized issue, so collaboration was squelched. After 16 weeks of learning something so fascinating to me, and working amongst such talented artists, I thought I would have made acquaintances whom I wanted to keep in touch with.The fear of plagiarism seemed to interfere with such connections. Peer reviews were as rocky as in any other coursera course. Even after a dozen weeks of peer reviews, and peer reviewing peer reviews, I still read many peer reviews with just a few short statements like, "you should have tried harder", "make it better", and other comments that didn't give any constructive guidance. This course was so intense and dense, I downloaded the subtitles, and edited them to make step-by-step directions to support the videos. The subtitle files were often previously edited for typos and clarity, which was a blessing. Technology presented its usual challenges, as coursera gets up and running: confusing quizzes, due dates that had to be corrected, assignments that required us to do things we couldn't technically do through the coursera platform... Our instructors directed us to use any website we chose for uploading some of our assignments. I felt really ill at ease following links provided by my classmates, to who-knows-where, and ignoring security risks to fulfill course requirements. My enthusiasm and trust in humanity carried me through it, but you might want to think this through before you do so. I saw in the discussion forums that I was not alone burning the midnight oil, learning the material. It was fascinating, and the assignments challenged us to develop a high level of expertise. I was inspired to do a great deal for each assignment, as I learned about worlds I had not known existed, and appreciate the deadlines that restricted me to more reasonable compositions.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>3360</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Computational Arts</course_title><school>School:  The State University of New York</school><review_data_id>4155</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Natalya</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>0</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/natalya</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-12-07</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is very ineresting and useful course.

Since I am strongly interested in autonomous robotics and systems engineering, this course was very helpful to me. I had studied signal processing on my own, having read the text Signals and Systems, by Oppenheim et al., and also part of the text Discrete-Time Processing, by Oppenheim and Schafer, but I had not taken a course in signal processing prior to taking this class. There were definitely a number of concepts for which I had not developed a satisfactory framework, my intuition for the subject was limited, and there were also several basic concepts I did not understand. I found this course chiefly helpful in developing intuitions about digital signal processing, and the video lectures are very clear and helped me to understand concepts better. Furthermore, all of the techniques introduced in the course are nicely synthesized in developing a communications system example in the last several lectures of the course, which was very impressive and insightful. A number of the other lectures, too, proved to provide some superb insights. The homework problems were oriented directly toward the video lectures, and were sometimes enjoyably challenging and difficult. I felt, too, that they sometimes helped me go beyond the lectures in developing my skills, and provided insights related to future lectures. Due to the difficulty of some of the problems, I simply had to accept that sometimes I was not going to solve problems correctly. This gave the course and edge of difficulty I enjoyed, but I can see that some people might find the homework problems unpalatable, especially because one's grade on the course comes from the degree to which the problems are solved successfully. As a beginner in this area, I simply had to accept that sometimes I was not going to do as well as I would have liked. The course does have a strong "hands-on" flavor, oriented toward people with engineering backgrounds. I am more of a theoretical type, with a pretty good background in physics and mathematics. Still, I was able to complete the course, despite certain deficiencies in my background, and found the video lectures and the homework problems to be very rewarding. The presentation of techniques in an intuitive way, and the synthesis of techniques in some rather beautiful examples certainly make the course worthwhile, and the two instructors for the course are outstanding. I also thought that the staff, in helping students in the student forum, displayed a high level of competence and knowledge. For me, the one weak point in the course was that I did not find the text to be very useful in supplementing the lectures. My study time was limited to about 10 hours per week, due to my time constraints, and I just did not have enough time to read the text properly, which often discussed topics not considered in lecture. I personally feel that I would have to spend 15 to 20 hours per week to properly read the text. Compared to another course I have taken from Coursera, I found that the student forum was not as lively, and the questions being asked by students on the whole were not very interesting to me. However, I often found the answers supplied by the instructors or staff to be interesting, and this somewhat balanced out an otherwise tepid forum. Of course, in part, I have only myself to blame for this, as I could have contributed to the forum more often. I am not blaming anyone, but the atmosphere of the course just did not seem to foster lively debate. My dislikes about the course are very minor. The course is definitely superb and worthwhile taking, provided one has some background in math or engineering that is appropriate for the level of the course, which, relative to courses in the United States, is about a junior or senior college level. I was very happy with the course, and felt that it prepared me well to go on to more advanced studies. I strongly recommend this course for people interested in signal processing, who want to consolidate some of the basics, and see the integration of some of the important techniques in a valuable intuitive way.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>2</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>105</course_id><course_title>Digital Signal Processing</course_title><school>School:  École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</school><review_data_id>33954</review_data_id><reviewer_name>soesilo wijono</reviewer_name><other_review_count>19</other_review_count><other_course_completed>19</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/soesilowijono</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-05-30</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Very satisfied with this course.

The instructors (Prandoni, and Vetterli) are knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the material and there is a corresponding free online text designed for the course. The course is fast moving and mathematically intense with a fair number of homework assignments. If you get through the course, you will have a preliminary handling of some of the fundamental topics in DSP and hopefully be ready for a more advanced course. One nice feature of the course is the preliminary integration of Matlab for solving some of the more advanced problems. As it turns out, you should be able to acquire the much cheaper Matlab student version if you are enrolled in the course, which will also come in handy in other Coursera/other MOOCs.

But in the same time my evaluation mark to this course is relatively how, as the perception of the professional in the sphere. Barbara Oakley is pretty owful, as lecturer: she has a very low voice (which is just a killing feature for on-line learning, which you simply may NOT HEAR, what she says sometimes), monotone manner of speech, and - most unpleasant - not a professional in the area she's teaching in this course. Most of the material is actually true: you should mix focused and diffuse mode, use analogies and chuck the information for better understanding, and recall, as well as test yourself for better memorizing. But it's a very few inputs of the big ocean of basic foundations and practical tools for better studying, starting from clear goal-setting, persistence development, using mistakes and external advises, multi-modal information, personalizing material, etc., etc., etc. My final opinion: nice try, but far below really professional level.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>391</course_id><course_title>Programmed cell death</course_title><school>School:  Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU)</school><review_data_id>111798</review_data_id><reviewer_name/><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>0</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/reemhamed700</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-08-21</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>i think that be avery useful and good information to me . and every student study biology or releated science or to study cancer to know more about how cell get ride from itself</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>391</course_id><course_title>Programmed cell death</course_title><school>School:  Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU)</school><review_data_id>4441</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-12-10</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>This course was difficult for me, however it was so very interesting, thought provoking and presented well.

It's a fascinating field and well-worth taking as it plays a crucial role in the treatment of many auto-immune diseases, cancers and malignancies. A bonus feature that i liked was the professor taking time out to answer a small handful of questions posed by the students.

The course is very well built because it does not present you with "out-of-the-oven", complete and validated knowledge. It tells you the story of how research has progressed in the field. It's structure is "this study made this breakthrough discovery; then that study added another discovery, etc". To me, this seemed highly engaging. There isn't a dull moment all the way. I do think that you need some background in biology and research to grasp all the concepts. I struggled with many topics in the course, although the professor makes an effort to explain slowly and build from simple to complex. I would recommend that future offerings add 1-2 weeks of very basic biological concepts before the course goes full speed into the apoptotic pathways.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>2</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>391</course_id><course_title>Programmed cell death</course_title><school>School:  Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU)</school><review_data_id>3047</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Asaf</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/asaf</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-08-24</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I've had some experience studying cell death in traditional biology courses, as well as sifting through papers trying to get a picture of the field for research. Programmed cell death is becoming a very important subject in the field of biology, and at the moment is not covered well (if at all) by current textbooks. Dr Conradt's course more than rectifies this problem - it provides an overview of the field as it is, as well as introduces and demonstrates the use of the techniques used to elucidate the various cell death mechanisms. The production value of this class is wonderful as well - animations/images for every concept, with Dr Conradt presenting all of the material The three TAs have done a great job and answered practically every question I had within 24 hours. It seems they did this for all participants. This is great, but I hope they don't wear themselves out when the course gets bigger on the next offering... The techniques and background material could be confusing, especially for students new to biology. I guess if the course won't add a week or two of background in biology, it would be up to the interested student to do the extra reading.

There are no other assignments, which is okay, but I think I could always use some optional practice, if there was any.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>112</course_id><course_title>Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 2</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>75236</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Steven Frank</reviewer_name><other_review_count>39</other_review_count><other_course_completed>38</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/stevenfrank</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-05-31</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Although this course picks up where Part 1 left off in terms of topics covered, it's a whole different experience in terms of difficulty. Whereas Part 1 stressed concrete concepts like sorting, searching, and asymptotic analysis, Part 2 soars into the esoteric world of graph theory, NP completeness, and proofs. The algorithms are not so much harder to code than in Part 1, but the data sets may tax the limits of your system -- you may have to find some tricks to simplify the processing in order to get an answer, and those tricks are not really part of the course; you're on your own, with the help of your fellow students. As in Part 1, Tim Roughgarden is an awesome teacher. In fact he's so unpretentiously articulate, and so down to earth, that you may sometimes lose sight of how complicated what he's talking about really is. Don't worry, though, the problem sets and programming assignments will ensure that you've really grasped the material. When you've finished both parts of this course, you'll really have canvassed the landscape -- not only of specific algorithms, their structures and performance limits, but of some foundational questions in computer science.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>112</course_id><course_title>Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 2</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>29874</review_data_id><reviewer_name>timothy235</reviewer_name><other_review_count>12</other_review_count><other_course_completed>10</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/timothy235</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-08-10</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Both courses were excellent.

Several of the algorithms and discussions in Part 2 refer back to concepts discussed in the first part, so it is highly recommended to complete part 1 first. A few of the major topics covered include minimum spanning tree algorithms, the knapsack problem, dynamic programming, shortest path problems, the traveling salesman problem, P vs. NP and NP completeness and heuristics for hard problems. Part 2 is considerably harder than part 1 and the algorithms you write for homework need to be implemented well to get answers in a reasonable amount of time and without exceeding your system's memory. It is possible to complete the class using a high-level language (I used Python) but you'll probably have to spend a bit more time tweaking your code to get solutions in a reasonable amount of time. Like part 1, the instruction quality and assignments are top notch. My biggest gripe with the class is that the coverage of the P vs. NP question and NP completeness is brief, so students don’t gain a deep understand of what P vs. NP and NP completeness really mean. Introduction to theoretical computer science by Udacity provides a much more through overview of that particular topic. That said, Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 2 is another outstanding offering by Stanford and Coursera.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>112</course_id><course_title>Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 2</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>4685</review_data_id><reviewer_name>soesilo wijono</reviewer_name><other_review_count>19</other_review_count><other_course_completed>19</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/soesilowijono</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-05-15</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>As with the first part, this course is a good and precious algorithm course. In my opinion this is another required course before taking more advanced discrete-optimization course The programming assignments were more challenging than I was expected because standard algorithm wouldn't solve the problem in appropriate time. You'll need to think laterally and following the discussion forum to be able to run your program in reasonable time. Just to use standard algorithm will bring you to run your program in hours even in days due to the huge data samples to be processed. The same as part 1, the keys of success are, (1) watch all the lectures, (2) read the textbooks, (3) write the programming code, (4) follow the discussion forum.

I learned alot and am sad the first part came to an end (just finished the final exam) Each week they released a +-1 hr lecture video, chopped up into segments of about 10 minutes each. These are packed with information, but the professor guides you through the material in a great way. I preferred the 'newly' recorded lectures over the in class ones though (mainly because of the pace and audio quality) The weekly quizzes counted towards 30% of your grade, and were a nice way to process everything you saw/heard. A great learning tool, and a good preparation for the final exam since you could take them more than once. The only real let down would be the inactivity of the TA. Alot of questions did not get answered, things that were promised in the beginning of the course (study guides, etc) did not get posted, and so on. The technical staff was very helpful though. All in all a great course. Very informative, not too difficult, but I can imagine some students struggleing if they lack any background in molecular biology. If they would release the second part of this course, I will enroll, without a doubt. I'd recommend this to everyone who is interested in this field!</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>3195</course_id><course_title>Virology I: How Viruses Work</course_title><school>School:  Columbia University</school><review_data_id>4492</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-12-11</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I am so happy I got to take this class, and there is so much I understand now, not only about viruses but also about genetics.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>3195</course_id><course_title>Virology I: How Viruses Work</course_title><school>School:  Columbia University</school><review_data_id>4259</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-12-09</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I had no prior Virology experience, and my academic background was primarily chemistry, from decades ago.

This course is much much better than the first one because it's more challenging, more theoretical explanations are given so you can understand regression in and out. Coverage is quite good (lasso feature selection is given, kernel methods, etc.) and instructors explicitly list points that they omitted at the end so you could go and take a look. I also appreciate the choice of using either scikit-learn or sframes and dato graphlab in exercises , and I think building everything from the ground up is an excellent exercise while using dato and sframes is a very good option for those with less time (though in this part of the course you build more things from scratch, so it's almost an equal choice). Plus I like the way Emily and Carlos teach (though no Carlos in this part), the way they are engaged and excited about MOOCs. One minus for me was that the forums are community driven and I didn't see any replies from professors in there. Overall, highly recommended.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50635</course_id><course_title>Machine Learning: Regression</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>117263</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Raúl Solera</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/raulsolera</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-01-03</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Excellent introduction to regression, all concepts are introduced with a detail I have not seen in any other course.

The 6-week course builds from simple linear regression with one input feature in the first week to ridge regression, the lasso and kernel regression. Week 3 also takes a detour to discuss important machine learning topics like the bias/variance trade-off, overfitting and validation to motivate ridge and lasso regression. Like the first course in the specialization, "Regression" uses GraphLab Create, a Python package that will only run on the 64-bit version of Python 2.7. You can technically use other tools like Scikit-learn or even R to complete the course, but using GraphLab will make things much easier because all the course materials are built around it. Knowledge of basic calculus (derivatives), linear algebra and Python is recommended. Grading is based upon weekly comprehension quizzes and programming assignments. Each week of Machine Learning: Regression tackles specific a topic related to regression in significant depth. The lectures take adequate time to build your understanding and intuition about how the techniques work and go deep enough that you could implement the algorithms presented yourself. The presentation slides are high quality and available as .pdf downloads, although the text written by the lecturer isn't particularly neat. The lecturer isn't the best orator around but she manages to explain topics well and the course takes plenty of time to cover important considerations and review key concepts at the end of each week. Overall, the pacing and organization of course materials is excellent and the presentation, while not perfect, is personable and clear. Every lesson in "Regression" has at least one accompanying programming assignment that explores the topics covered in lecture. The assignments are contained in Jupyter (iPython) notebooks and come with all the explanatory text and support code you need to complete them. The labs walk you through implementing some key machine learning algorithms like simple linear regression, multiple linear regression with gradient descent, ridge regression, lasso with coordinate descent and k-nearest neighbors regression. The assignments are not particularity difficult as much of the code is already written for you and most tasks you have to perform are spelled out in great detail sometimes to the point where each line of code you have to write is noted in a text comment. Some may not appreciate this level of guidance but it keeps the assignments moving along at a steady pace and puts the focus on understanding machine learning concepts rather than programming skills and limits time wasted troubleshooting bugs. Machine Learning: Regression is an excellent introduction to regression that covers several key machine learning algorithms while building understanding of fundamental machine learning concepts that extend beyond regression. If you have any interest in regression and have an environment that can run GraphLab, take this course. I give Machine Learning: Regression 5 out of 5 stars: Excellent.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>2</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50635</course_id><course_title>Machine Learning: Regression</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>117010</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Volker Hadamschek</reviewer_name><other_review_count>3</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/gregsavage</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-12-23</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I like this course a lot. It is much harder than course 1 of this coursera specialization which makes sense. It suprised me in a positive way that a lot of focus is on maths and on the intuition behind it which is valuable. Emily Fox is a wonderful teacher. Still I doubt how much of the content is relevant for practice. I am a kaggler and for this, there are more important techniques like boosting and so on which often get the short end of the stick in MOOCs. This seems also to be the case for the spezialization containing this course. Putting it short, I am not fully convinced in contrast to other people that we should put a lot of effort in linear regression to master machine learning. Nevertheless wonderfully presented course with depth.

It's "computational", but there's no programming. The professor really had a lot of work to prepare the exercises so that you don't really need to write code yourself, but still learn how to use available packages to solve real research questions. So don't be afraid to take the course even if you don't know how to code! The exercises are assisted and you won't have much problem solving them, as long as you get the concepts. I highly recommend future sessions of this course to everyone, regardless of background.

The course is about the type of software it takes to make modern processors (not quantum processes). From logic to layout, while I don't plan to build my own ICs i join to learn some cool algorithms. Around the first half is about computational boolean algebra which is also very useful in AI (which I try to learn). The next half is about technology mapping, gate placing, wire routing and timing analysis. Areas with many hard problems and interesting heuristics. Instead of playing with toy problems like other courses you get to work on industry level problems. NICE ;-) If your following the mastery track, you will do 4 programming assignments in a language of your choosing. The programming assignments is fairly easy but also very educational. I liked them a lot. Only point of criticism is that you only have 1 try on the homework, which I feel is not optimal for learning.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>2</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>163</course_id><course_title>Women and the Civil Rights Movement</course_title><school>School:  University of Maryland, College Park</school><review_data_id>117505</review_data_id><reviewer_name/><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/terezat</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-01-11</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>One of the most eye-opening, insightful and well organized courses I have ever taken.

Amazing. Inspiring. Brilliant. It's not an understatement to say that Women and the Civil Rights Movement changed my life. I almost didn't take this class because I thought I knew what I needed to know about the American Civil Rights Movement. History is one of my favorite subjects but I've never heard history like this when I was in school. The workload was fair and included about two hours of video lectures and additional required reading (about another half an hour to an hour, depending on how quickly I devoured the readings) and a one-try, untimed quiz per week. A plus of this course (and I wish other courses would pick up) was that Professor Barkley Brown offered two options to receive the basic certificate ~ one via the weekly quizzes alone, the other via peer assignments alone and a Distinguished option for completing both tracks or one track plus forum interaction. Professor Elsa Barkley Brown was personable, very down-to-earth and knows this subject well. The weekly video lessons went by so quickly thanks to Professor Barkley Brown's friendly presenting. I won't say that some lessons weren't difficult to cover (Emmett Till, for instance) and there were more than a few lessons that had me in tears, angry or frustrated. But that was the beauty of the course, it moved me and inspired me to see this part of history differently and to be motivated to find out more for myself. I found Women and the Civil Rights Movement a nice course to take alongside Professor Philip Zelikow's The Modern World as Zelikow's class featured almost no minorities or women players. Women and the Civil Rights Movement is highly recommended for everyone, it will definitely fill in some gaps in your history education.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>424</course_id><course_title>Physics 1 for Physical Science Majors</course_title><school>School:  University of Colorado Boulder</school><review_data_id>57390</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-10-12</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review/><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>424</course_id><course_title>Physics 1 for Physical Science Majors</course_title><school>School:  University of Colorado Boulder</school><review_data_id>33404</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Nigel Visser</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>0</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/nigelvisser</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-05-23</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>I have done high school physics, and some college classical mechanics.

Dubson explains concepts well by using: [1] Observational experience (through a video, real experiment or a VERY clever virtual experiment, or sometimes both because the virtual experiment can do things like stop time - graph things for you!) [2] Origin of discovery - History (who - how was it discovered? why was it? meaning of word?) [3] Contextual application of concepts (how has the concepts been used - why is it used? i.e. for engineering purposes, like conservation of angular momentum being used for the Hubble telescope, how you can find the speed of a car from skid marks, how the speed of a bullet hitting a target can be found) Those 3 points are what I've found (so far) to be vital ingredients in learning anything. I.e. [1] How does it work (it must be experienced in a way that which allowed the original discovers brains to think of the concepts in the first place), [2] How/why did it come about? [3] What is it used for? Not only does Dubson do those 3 things very well, but he tests the concepts CONSTANTLY in-class in context of questions after the concepts are taught using those 3 ingredients. The questions are clever in really ELUCIDATING the concepts further. They do this because he tries to understand the physics tools/exact knowledge required to answer a question, and the potential misconceptions that may occur. Coursera's website seemed to be easier to navigate - neater than edX; which is why I chose to do Physics 1 here instead of there. Walter Lewin is a renowned professor - teacher, and I think Dubson if he continues, can easily surpass his teaching status. What makes him particularly different (as well as the great use of those 3 ingredients I mentioned above) is the use concept tests in class - the virtual experiments from PhET. I took this class as a refresher to physics 1 as I intend to teach it at Secondary (high school) Advanced level. I didn't think I would also learn pedagogically useful tools - methods AS WELL. That's my 2 cents anyway. (No I was not paid for this review, the guy's class really is that damn good at engaging - being comprehensive. If you're scared of the maths - let me tell you I'm dyscalculaic. The maths never feels unnecessary, [except 1 tiny bit - he will tell you why], and you can easily see the reason WHY you're doing it to help elucidate physical phenomena in ways you cannot otherwise understand.)</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>424</course_id><course_title>Physics 1 for Physical Science Majors</course_title><school>School:  University of Colorado Boulder</school><review_data_id>4516</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Roger Leyster</reviewer_name><other_review_count>10</other_review_count><other_course_completed>9</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/rogerleyster</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-12-22</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Summary: A truly excellent first-semester Physics course for those not afraid of a little math. Topics: First-semester Physics kinematics topics including one- and two-dimensional motion, Newtons Laws of motion, circular motion, the conservation laws of energy, momentum, and angular momentum, Newton's law of gravity. Background: To do well in this course you will need to be comfortable with algebraic manipulation. Although calculus is not strictly necessary, it helps if you understand differentiation. (Frankly: you cannot really understand the laws of motion without knowing what a derivative is.) Lectures: Prof. Dubson is an outstanding lecturer, one of the best I have ever seen in my many years of taking college courses. He is enthusiastic, articulate, and has excellent chalk-board skills. There are three lectures each week of approximately 30 minutes each. He gave in-class demonstrations which very much helped clarify many of the concepts (e.g., conservation of linear and angular momentum, moments of inertial, etc.). In-Lecture Quizzes: There are a healthy number of in-lecture concept quizzes which do a good job of making you less of a passive listener and more an engaged participant. The in-lecture quizzes are also given to the students in the lecture hall so you get to see how well you do compared to the other students. Assigned Work: There is a homework assignment for each week's lecture. These do what good homework assignments should do: clarifies the lecture concepts by asking you to think through problems. There were two one-hour mid-terms and a two-and-a-half hour Final exam. Labs: There are no labs. Given that this is an online course, this is not surprising, but if they could figure out some way to pair the rest of this course with a hands-on lab component, this would be the perfect physics course. There are some very helpful on-line lab simulators, though. These can be found by doing a web search for "phetsim". Supplementary Material: A helpful set of lecture notes in PDF format was provided. Also, practice exams and solutions were made available before each exam. Forums: The forum traffic was a little light, but there were several people who were ready to help explain things, and the official course personnel would often post clarifications. IN CONCLUSION: I learned a great deal and thoroughly enjoyed the lectures and assignments. It is astounding that such a high-quality course was made available for free.

No doubt about it. The topics are extremely interesting, the lectures are very helpful and "chapeau" to professor Petra Bonfert-Taylor. I had a slight knowledge of Complex Analysis and thanks to her I now have a quite big knowledge of Complex Analysis. Her patience, dedication and enthusiasm is truly admirable. I recommend this course strongly, if you like mathematics, even if you like them slightly, trust me, you will enjoy highly this course. Although, in my opinion, the workload is quite big, it is necessary. You will learn more if you really dedicate yourself to it. You have to complete 6 homework and 3 peer graded assignments. I never thought that a mathematical MOOC could have peer assessments. It was a BRIGHT idea. You had to complete three of them. There were excercises you had to do or with a software or with pencil and paper. You took a picture of it and your peers graded your work. It was extremely interesting, not only the dedication and treat with which you had to do it, but it was equally interesting to grade others. To be able to see how others think mathematically is a true privilege. The homework is also interesting. You work on everything that you learned in the lectures. And although the workload is big, you can apply "late days" to your homework so you can have more time to complete it. It's just a matter of organizing your time. This is my third MOOC and it is the first time I cheked the discussion fora on a daily basis. People were very polite and very enthusiastic and very helpful. I do not know to thank them. There work was amazing. This was in fact, an AMAZING course. I strongly recomend it. It was professional in all the ways I look at it. The lectures, the grading, the professor. My sincere congratulations to professor Petra Bonfert-Taylor, Wesleyan and to all the staff of the course.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>3263</course_id><course_title>Analysis of a Complex Kind</course_title><school>School:  Wesleyan University</school><review_data_id>4688</review_data_id><reviewer_name>soesilo wijono</reviewer_name><other_review_count>19</other_review_count><other_course_completed>19</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/soesilowijono</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-12-28</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Finishing this course as a refresher to the basic level I've taken in my almamater (to explain the complex analysis in electric circuits).

It is the first course in a 5-part Machine Learning specialization. The course provides a broad overview of key areas in machine learning, including regression, classification, clustering , recommender systems and deep learning, using short programming case studies as examples. The course assumes basic Python programming skills and it uses a software package called GraphLab that requires a 64-bit operating system running Python 2.7. Grades are based on periodic comprehension quizzes and short programming assignments. The course covers a broad range of machine learning topics at a high level with the promise of drilling down into the details in future courses in the specialization. The lecturers have good chemistry, but they tend to get distracted when they are on screen together. The video and slide quality are very good and although the delivery is a little rough around the edges at times, the lectures are informative. The machine learning methods covered aren’t necessarily treated as complete black boxes, but the course intentionally avoids getting too deep into the details, putting the emphasis on conceptual understanding. The weekly labs are contained in short IPython Notebooks—interactive text and code documents rendered in a web browser—that illustrate some simple models in GraphLab. The labs themselves are easy and don’t require much coding other than calling various built in GraphLab functions. The hardest part about the class is getting your programming environment set up in the first place. If you don’t have a new version of 64-bit Python 2.7, you can’t run GraphLab. It is relatively easy to get set up if you can use the recommended Anaconda Python distribution, but getting things set up manually on an existing Python installation may prove troublesome. The instructors provided some workarounds for doing the course without GraphLab or using GraphLab on Amazon’s cloud computing service; I wouldn’t take the course without getting GraphLab working in some form. Many students decried the use of a non-open source package for an open class; I think it is useful to be exposed to new tools and GraphLab seems cleaner than Python’s popular scikit-learn package. In this sort of course, the focus should be one concepts rather than syntax. Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach achieves its goal of introducing machine learning at a high level without rushing or trying to cram too much into any particular week. What the professors lack in terms of polish they make up for with enthusiasm. Compatibility and setup issues will be a roadblock for some, but overcoming them is worth it. I give Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach 4.5 out of 5 stars: Great.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50878</course_id><course_title>Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>117065</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Borys Zibrov</reviewer_name><other_review_count>7</other_review_count><other_course_completed>6</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/boryszibrov</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-12-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>First of all, this is entry level very easy introductory course. It should give you general topic awareness, overview of things you can achieve with machine learning, etc. Don't expect math or even algorithms explanations here. Nonetheless even though I have some deeper knowledge of the topic the course was very enjoyable to me and I look forward to more detailed courses in Machine Learning specialization from Coursera. First of all, instructors were amazing very enthusiastic guys and went to great length to explain concepts and get across ideas they wanted to convey (I'm not new to the subject though so I might be wrong here, but my impression was they were very cool). Assignments were interesting and in python notebook format which I like. Also, I find doing assignments in python more fun then in Matlab. Things I didn't like: forum was not very active, I didn't monitor it closely though. Android version of this course didn't have a button for videos download.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>2</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50878</course_id><course_title>Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>117088</review_data_id><reviewer_name/><other_review_count>2</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/theofanis.lekkas</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-12-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I was very pleased with this course (and optimistic about the specialization.) The instructors are very thorough in breaking down the concepts. This course is not very math heavy, rather a high level introduction to machine learning. That being said, there is enough quality content - opportunities to work with the concepts presented to make this course worth the time (- money if upgrading) invested. I was skeptical of using graphlab initially (primarily because I would prefer using pandas - scikit learn,) however, I ended up agreeing with the instructors decision to use this tool (their intent is to teach ML concepts not the tools used.) The instructors do, however, make it fairly easy to use pandas - scikit learn if that's the direction a student wants to go. I strongly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning more about machine learning.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>222</course_id><course_title>Sustainable Agricultural Land Management</course_title><school>School:  University of Florida</school><review_data_id>1478</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Carolyn Hennes</reviewer_name><other_review_count>4</other_review_count><other_course_completed>2</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/carolynhennes</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-06-15</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>If you eat food, if you care about the environment, and if you are interested in how to provide for our present needs without damaging the planet for future generations, this is a good primer. There are some specific farm management practices addressed, mainly from Florida, one of our leading agricultural states, but not in great detail. For some international students who are already farming, this is a good introduction into practices they aren't familiar with and could boost their productivity and profit while at the same time conserve resources. For a young person exploring new career ideas, this would be a great introduction to the fact that we need more farmers as well as current philosophies behind food production and land management. The discussion boards were amazing, and took up the largest segment of time I spent on course work--not because I had to, but because I enjoyed communicating with the diverse international group that were taking the class with me. There is an optional project to complete to get the highest certificate, which I did not do. I thought there wouldn't be opportunity to complete it before the end of the course. Apparently I could have still done it even without reporting on any final outcomes.

At times, the lectures seem long and if you're not careful you can find yourself drifting off a little. But it's easy to rewind and pick back up. Instructor knows the material well and does a good job of conveying his knowledge although at times he seems to focus a little bit too much on his own geographic area. This does not effect the content or the quality of the lectures at all -- it just lends itself to the drifting off I mentioned earlier. The discussion forums are very diverse -- several enviromentalist promoting their ideology, several foreign students looking for useful information about best management practices, some large scale farmers and some small scale farmers and even a few scientists. The class participation rules are not very clear. I am not sure if I have met the goal or not although I actively participate in the forums. The quizzes come from the covered material and focus on the most important parts of the lectures which is really helpful given how long the lectures are. The grading scale, at least on the quizzes, is fair. I'd recommend this course for anyone with an interest in land management or best management practices.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>222</course_id><course_title>Sustainable Agricultural Land Management</course_title><school>School:  University of Florida</school><review_data_id>1332</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jenny Nazak</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>0</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/jennynazak1</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-04-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I'm a permaculture designer and educator by profession so I already had some knowledge of this subject and am keenly interested.

The forum point grading process was not clear at first but the faculty cleared up our confusions by answering the questions about this that we posted on the forums. I've only taken one other MOOC. The Sustainable Agriculture course is more practical and seems to be attracting a more practical-minded, hands-on kind of person than the other course. (Pretty much what I would expect.) The forums on this Sustainable Agriculture course attract a lot more participation than the other course.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>183</course_id><course_title>Principles of Public Health</course_title><school>School:  University of California, Irvine</school><review_data_id>4380</review_data_id><reviewer_name>sam tan</reviewer_name><other_review_count>33</other_review_count><other_course_completed>31</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/samt</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-12-10</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Taught by an exceptionally warm instructor.

The instructor was great and the class participation made it very interesting. 15,000 people were signed up from all over the world! The textbooks were optional, but the other materials were wonderful, downloadable slides and links to other websites. The guest speakers spoke on varied topics and were very good. This is my first class with Coursera, but I've already started another, based on this experience.

It is a 10 week course that is condensed into 5 weeks so there are a lot of lectures and supplementary reading involved. But it is enjoyable and educational, it is my favourite course so far. The quizzes are simple and the peer-assessed assignment is an interesting and interactive task. The lecturer, Dr. Zuzana Bic, is so passionate about the topic and she keeps it light with a sense of humour, I believe she is a big reason for the success of this course!</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>3581</course_id><course_title>Economics of Money and Banking, Part Two</course_title><school>School:  Columbia University</school><review_data_id>55604</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Thomas Forsell</reviewer_name><other_review_count>2</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/thomasforsell</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-09-21</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review/><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>3581</course_id><course_title>Economics of Money and Banking, Part Two</course_title><school>School:  Columbia University</school><review_data_id>51772</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Ricardo Teixeira</reviewer_name><other_review_count>86</other_review_count><other_course_completed>77</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/ricardoteixeira</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-08-22</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>This second part of the course did not deliver on its promise. The instructor said, during part 1, that we shouldn't be worried if things didn't make sense, because typically students only get "it" after the second part. That's hardly so. This second part was more confusing in some respects than part 1. The first week is a repetition of part 1, Then you move straight to new topics, always filled with technical jargon that at times becomes impossible to follow and other times is dull considering the repetition. If I had taken this class in school I would have needed to study a lot from textbooks to get a decent grade, because of the unstructured and "all over the place" nature of the classes. However, don't get me wrong! The course is far from bad. I sympathize wholeheartedly with the instructor's approach to finance and I think his ideas are a breath of fresh air. He is truly an original in his field and it is a privilege to learn from him. Despite all its shortcomings, you will learn more about finance and banking in this course than any other. So in a sense I recommend it - I just can't see what all the fuss is about (looking at the extremely high rates this course has received).</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>3581</course_id><course_title>Economics of Money and Banking, Part Two</course_title><school>School:  Columbia University</school><review_data_id>4004</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Nancy Walsh</reviewer_name><other_review_count>4</other_review_count><other_course_completed>4</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/nancywalsh</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-12-01</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I have no real experience with economics, but Dr. Mehrling's excellent lectures, lecture notes and presentation skills made this, along with Part One, among the best courses available online.

The Staff and professors jump right into the discussions. The quality is excellent and the student interaction adds to the courses.

I thought the course material was very well structured, and the quantity was just good. The lectures were absolutely top: I thoroughly enjoyed the calm and relaxed way intricate and sometimes difficult topics were explained. Also the format of the programming assignments was brilliant: it's not easy to find a method to rate the performance of implementations in any programming language possible. I had more difficulties with the Quizzes, which I think in many cases were based on mathematical intuition, something which I'm not very good at. I took this course because 6 years ago I was asked to build a tagger for addresses from all over the world. At the time I had no experience in NLP, but by working through some scientific papers I was able to build a system that is still operational today. No doubt that if I were to do this over, I'd do a much better job, but the things I learned then came in handy now. I learned that mathematical language is extremely concise compared to a mainstream programming language.

The papers he assigned for reading were on the longer side and could get dry but I confess that I still found those papers really worth my while. I have not taken another social epi course anywhere yet so its hard for me to say how this one stacks up with other such courses.

I liked the fact that the professor was showing us sample IUDs, I even liked the fact that she hesitated while speaking and repeated herself - it's what made the lectures authentic and natural, because that's how lecturers speak. What I didn't realize from the start was the fact that there will be so much emphasis on counselling, but after some thought I came to conclusion that it's just a way to put the knowledge into practice - and it definitely helped me remember the things we were taught. I believe that it would be useful to introduce more cultural concepts - i.e. more cultural background, and not only for the US. It was all shown beautifully in the first week and then somehow the cultural component was almost lost. And the potential is definitely there!

I listened to the lectures and took careful notes but did not do the assignments as i lacked the medical training.

I would recommend it for anyone interested in a first contact with the subject, since it does not demand any prior knowledge. An awesome introduction to International Relations!

I'm glad I have, this is one of the best courses I have ever seen. The real-life examples and fascinating stories about animal world have clearly stated sources, which is great if you want to dig up further. There are two big assignments along with the quizzes, the first one is to sum up a scientific articles into something that a layman could read, and the second one was to observe animals in the wild, in your neighborhood or via webcam, and to track their behavior. That way everybody could do it, since the instructors provided lots of webcam links to various animals - in ZOOs or natural habitat. This course is a PERFECT BLEND of theory and practice, and I'd recommend it to everyone. It got me interested in animal science, and it's wonderful to see the course Facebook group still being alive and full of interesting articles and discussions.

Fascinating and fun as many different types of animals were used as examples to illuminate the concepts. Very well-taught with just the right amount of content and difficulty...though i felt the material did get progressively more difficult towards the final weeks of the course. Great to see the bonus feature of guest appearance of other animal researchers as well as the written assignment of composing an article for the lay public based on a research paper. The latter turned out to be a good exercise of communicating scientific concepts and methodology and results without resorting to scientific jargon.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>167</course_id><course_title>Animal Behaviour</course_title><school>School:  The University of Melbourne</school><review_data_id>3322</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Rebecca</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>0</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/rebecca</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-09-29</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>I'm currently taking this class and I really enjoy it. I already had an interest in understanding animal behavior, so it's awesome to learn more about such a huge variety of animals. I'm very impressed with the quality of this class, the lectures are very informative while still able to put it into everyday language rather than getting weighed down by scientific speech. The class started off a bit slow during the first couple of weeks, but once we reached Communication and Mating Systems it's been really interesting information. As for the workload, I'm taking notes during the videos which is why it takes so long for me. You can probably spend only 2-4 hours and do well, especially since you get 3 attempts for the quizzes.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>35413</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Classical Music</course_title><school>School:  Yale University</school><review_data_id>110622</review_data_id><reviewer_name>ShloEmi Ohayon</reviewer_name><other_review_count>12</other_review_count><other_course_completed>10</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/shloemi</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-07-21</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>WOW!

He merges art and architecture, as well as snippets of history, with the music to give the student context and more nuanced understanding. He doesn't bombard you with too much music to retain, but has carefully chosen iconic (but not always the best-known) representative works that illustrate important points. Each lecture is engaging and builds on prior knowledge. The use of slides and videos is spot- on, just the write length of time and they are well-chosen. He has traveled widely and uses many of his own photographs, which are outstanding, as well. And now the negative bits. He repeats certain phrases often, in a peculiar way, with long pauses between the words, as though he were teaching a foreign speaker an English phrase. He does this as a sort of tic, not just when the phrase is an important one. Without a transcript to follow, the student must gaze steadfastly at the lecturer and he grimaces often, which is distracting. Some of the more technical points are not well explained, but luckily they usually don't appear on the quizzes and not really understanding them won't interfere with the general content for classical music novices--the real strength and intent of the course. Many of the lectures leave you wanting to know more, a sign of an outstanding course. As the other reviewer has mentioned, the quizzes are poorly written, badly edited, ambiguous and often focus more on the trivial facts than the major concepts. Sometimes it seems the questions parallel the lectures but weren't actually covered. I suspect this is the TAs responsibility, but, if so, he needs a bit more supervision and a really good editor. Re Coursera: this is my first Coursera course, as I am an edX fan, EdX is vastly superior in all ways, except in the breadth of course selection (which is why I'm taking this music class--edX is weak in the humanities.) The Progress tab in edX is very, very (extremely!) useful and motivating; Coursera has nothing that charts your progress. I object mightily to not having real-time transcript streaming beside the lecture, as well. It would be much better to have the quizzes follow immediately after the lectures, rather than appearing in a separate link.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>35413</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Classical Music</course_title><school>School:  Yale University</school><review_data_id>70029</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Anna Zakharova</reviewer_name><other_review_count>9</other_review_count><other_course_completed>2</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/AnnaZakharova</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-02-09</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Content of lectures is great, but quizzes contain many errors.

Do you feel like taking up a challenge? Are you fascinated by the intricacies of group decision? Have you ever wondered if simple plurality voting, used in most elections nowadays, really is the best way of electing candidates? Then this is the course for you! This is a wonderful course about group decision theory. You will hear about group decisions, what are the advantages and drawbacks of several mechanisms, some interesting paradoxes in choice, and also some crucial criteria when devising a method to allocate resources. This will challenge you to think about what is more important to you - would you prefer a division of goods in society that is envy-free or equitable, for example? The course is indeed introductory, but the lectures have a significant amount of detail and mathematical formalism. This is not all talk - you will really need to understand the concepts in depth and manipulate them in concrete calculations to pull through. The quizzes are hard (though the exam was relatively easier), but you have a passing grade of 80%. But the lectures are so enjoyable and the exercises so fun and instructive that it's worth carrying out all the work just for the sake of it. The instructor makes a great job at expressing how cool this area of research is. The only reason why I don't give it a full 5 stars is because the course gets confusing at times. There is so much information on so many different aspects of group choice that sometimes I felt lost, without knowing where I was in the lecture or in the syllabus. Of course this can be solved in future offerings simply by improving the introductory lectures each week. I'm sure the next time around this will be a 5-star course.

It was very informative and entertaining. Because of my strenuous working hours, I didn't have time to do the assignment (timeline of the material learnt in the course) nor to participate much (I did at the beginning but then gave up) in the discussion forums, which was mandatory this time. Next time it might not be, so it's worth checking again if you are interested in the subject but repelled by the mandatory options. In any case, if you are not particularly looking for a grade or a verified certificate, the knowledge you'll get from this course might be quite rewarding enough per se.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>221</course_id><course_title>Music's Big Bang: The Genesis of Rock 'n' Roll</course_title><school>School:  University of Florida</school><review_data_id>29875</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Victor Campos Silveira</reviewer_name><other_review_count>15</other_review_count><other_course_completed>15</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/victorcampossilveira</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-05-11</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>* My Prior Experience: I had taken "History of Rock", offered by Prof. John Covach, from University of Rochester. In fact, it seems to be a good idea to complete Prof. Covach's course first, if possible. * Evaluation activities: There is a 10-question quizz every week. Participation in discussion forums also is required. There is also an opitional project plan, which consisted in building a timeline about the birth of Rock and Roll. * Good points: \- The lessons are, in general, well organised, following a logical connection between music, technology and history. \- Professor Carlson is always present in the discussion forums, stimulating debates and aiding students as well as possible. \- Quizzes can be done several times, permiting to improve the grade, if needed. Moreover, due dates are considerably flexible. \- The opitional project plan, required for those who want a Statement of Accomplishment with Distinction, is very exciting. To build a timeline contributes to organise some ideas and better understand the progress of facts that caused the rise of Rock and Roll. * Bad points: \- Some themes are divided between two week with no need, impairing thinking on the subject. \- Mandatory discussions sometimes are boring. Although it stimulates interaction, people also write things they do not want to, just to achieve the established aim. * Overall evaluation: It is quite interesting! "Music's Big Bang: The Genesis of Rock 'n' Roll" makes a travel in the period before the rhythm until its first generation of Rock stars, showing their influences over later groups. It is a way of focusing on the first years of Rock 'n' Roll and broading the knowledge on this period. Well... I advise you: Take it! It worths every minute you spend on it!

I have no background in Thermodynamics and just wanted to learn some. This I did. The special virtue of the course is the instructor working through examples and avoiding gaseous generalities. She has won teaching awards and one sees why. Leaving out a discussion of entropy (though T-s diagrams appeared at the end) was a good idea as far as I was concerned. I have one advantage in that I have Borgnakke - Sonntag, Fundamentals of Thermodynamics 7e so could read around topics. I have had the book a while now, but can now manage it, thanks to this course.

Pros: consists of 5-6 lectures by the instructor, each ~8-20 minutes PDF slides provided; links to free textbooks workload only 3-6 hours per week in-video quizzes (don’t count towards grade) interesting material; you learn a lot, including usage of steam tables easy to not difficult for most; gentle intro homeworks (HWs) limited to 2 submissions HWs are combinations of multiple choice questions and quantitative problems grading is 100% HW; no exam (Pro? Con?) instructor knows her stuff signature track offered discussion forums supported well through TAs not peer graded (not necessary) Cons: slides rather empty, the instructor draws diagrams and equations in the videos thus you should take notes of the lecture videos instructor did not participate in discussion forum you can ace the course by relying on deductive reasoning after 1st HW submission HWs usually had 2-3 errors, but the TAs were there in time to correct Summary: This introduction to thermodynamics is very introductory. I think that serious high school students will do well in this course. You can easily get by without calculus. I was expecting a bit more from the University of Michigan. Deduct one star for that, despite the FAQ being quite clear. Discussion of entropy is pointedly missing, but gas/liquid qualities, pressures, temperatures, joules, kilograms, enthalpies and specific heats abound. Conservation of energy and mass is central. Power plant analysis is interesting. However, the “bar” (pun intended) should be raised somewhat. As to the rather empty slides, I believe it was intentional, to get you to take notes. It worked for me. A timed final exam should be included. If you already have had one course in thermo, skip it. I did not, so I found it very useful and look forward to the next level of instruction, which I’m sure won’t be as easy.

It also features lectures on basic cosmology and astrophysics, with a detailed course wiki. Assignments aren't difficult, but there's a lot of calculations, however easy ones, and half of them include DS9 work.

What a wonderfully designed course! Unlike other courses on US Constitutional history, which usually go monotonously through the articles and the amendments one by one, this course is lively and relevant. It does include an analysis of the Constitution, but the topics are presented in terms of their impact on current events. The lectures are short and sweet - a bit too short, if I may say so. The quizzes are very easy. That's what prevents it from being a 5-star course. Still, the professor is extraordinary, the visuals of the lectures are flawless (and helpful), and the material should be the concern of any informed citizen in the US or abroad. If you only take 1 course on US Constitutional history, then I recommend this one.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>12656</course_id><course_title>Unethical Decision Making in Organizations</course_title><school>School:  University of Lausanne</school><review_data_id>116456</review_data_id><reviewer_name/><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/jtl613_981</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-12-06</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Excellent, In-Depth, Well Organized.

Great thinkers of the past and of our time are utilized as well as current events to bring the course together. The Professors are highly invested in ensuring that this is a productive learning experience. As with any course you will get out of it what you put in, and here the Professors have gone above and beyond to ensure the concepts are clear, easily applied and can be shared.

The course is one of the best I have done so far. It sharpened my awareness about how our peers and working environments influence us in a profound way. The discussions on the forums were delightful and the instructors also were very active and tried to engage with us through the forums and regular Google hangouts. We learnt about many examples of unethical decisions in organizations such as the Ford Pinto and the Challenger disaster and how the circumstances lead people who were not evil by nature to behave in a way that produced very evil outcomes. In the final week we learnt how to defend ourselves against the mechanism that make us ethically blind. Since we are all embedded in some sort of context I recommend this course to anyone with all my heart.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>417</course_id><course_title>How Green Is That Product?

The course materials are dense and well supported with supplement videos, PDF transcripts with additional notes, and links to real reports and studies. I especially like the fact that homeworks are not hard but they are not ridiculously straightforward either. They are the right amount of challenging. Which is not the case in some other courses on Coursera. There is also a project starting from week 3 in the form an environmental life cycle assessment study of a bottled soft drink manufacturing which we build by applying the knowledge acquired each week. The instructor is knowledgeable, methodical, and enthusiastic.

You do need to know how to program prior to taking this course, but this really nails down the material hard. It's not very much lecture-based. In fact, you are pretty much using an interactive text book. You will read most of the material yourself, but code exercises are embedded throughout the readings. The code exercises are what really make this course fantastic. The exercises are challenging and really reinforce what you learn.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>44776</course_id><course_title>Finding Hidden Messages in DNA (Bioinformatics I)</course_title><school>School:  University of California, San Diego</school><review_data_id>119432</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Steven Frank</reviewer_name><other_review_count>39</other_review_count><other_course_completed>38</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/stevenfrank</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-03-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course begins a six-part series on bioinformatics algorithms that works its way through the excellent textbook written by Professors Pevzner and Compeau. In this first installment, you explore what most people probably think of as bioinformatics: sleuthing through DNA to find patterns and "hidden messages" -- that is, functional areas that direct gene expression or otherwise affect what DNA does and how it does it. How you find such regions without knowing in advance what you're looking for is what this class is all about, and it involves algorithmic and statistical analysis. If you've taken a course on algorithm design (the Stanford MOOC is fabulous), here's where you get to apply those techniques to the life-science domain. The course offers two tracks: a "biologist" track for the computer tenderfoot and a "hacker" track for more experienced programmers. Although it's certainly possible to get a lot out of this course without programming, the heart and soul of bioinformatics is training your computer to do amazing things with biological data. The course is exceptionally well organized and well staffed. Each week's unit has a series of lessons presented in an interactive version of the professors' eminently readable and often entertaining textbook. The lessons contain programming tasks that implement various concepts introduced in the text, as well as a quiz that nicely tests your knowledge at a higher level. Some of those programming tasks are pretty challenging. Those on the biologist track undertake an extensive series of non-programming exercises instead. There are also short lectures which, while useful and entertaining, aren't actually necessary for success; the interactive text is so understandable and complete that it has all you really need. This course has enjoyed well-deserved acclaim and is the definitive MOOC for those interested in bioinformatics.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>44271</course_id><course_title>Public-Private Partnerships (PPP): How can PPPs help deliver better services?</course_title><school>School:  The World Bank Group</school><review_data_id>75494</review_data_id><reviewer_name/><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>0</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/samuelwere63</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-06-09</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>although the approach of the PPP to infrastructural development is gaining momentum in emerging economies, their use as a tool to accelerate this development agenda in developing countries is still immature. the capacities to implement programmes using PPPs is generally underdeveloped in these countries. subsequently there is perception that PPPs are complex processes and takes for ever for the project to come to financial and commercial closure. the other challenge about the PPPs although related to capacities is the weak governance arrangements that may negate the benefits of PPPs as an instrument for increased efficiency. the current belief of most policy makers in the Ministry of Health where i work is that PPPs are like donations (financial or otherwise) from private sector for public sector. but for those who have understood a bit of PPP concepts the fear of loss of jobs as a result of private sector "takeover" has significantly impeded the uptake of PPP. capacity building is and sensitization on PPPs is ongoing albeit the slow change in mindset.

But if you're not in the US, the course still has lots for you because we all rely on food, right? An Introduction to the US Food System isn't a necessarily difficult class, but it does require you to engage your mind and it also requires a certain time commitment. Perhaps, like others who took this class, you will find that the information presented even leads you to change the way you eat. Perhaps, like myself and others, you already try to eat a whole foods diet with low or no animal products, there's still much more to learn. The presentations were thorough and enlightening, on subjects such as Food Animal Production to the Farm Bill and segments on Meatless Monday. I appreciated the segment on the Farm Bill because it presented an important aspect for average citizens and those living in the US to change the system ~ via congresspersons and groups working to change aspects of the bill. In all, An Introduction to the US Food System is a great course for those who want information about how food is produced, what's going on with our resources and how the average person can help make the best choices for her own self ~ both in choosing foods and getting involved in changing the system.

Throughout the course, high academic standards were maintained, in the video lectures, the background materials and in the discussion forums, and I am grateful for that. I feel that I have really accomplished something big by doing the peer evaluated assignment and passing the final test. The lectures are tought by experts in their field, and the forum discussions were highly relevant and interesting, because of the large number of participants from all over the world and the relevancy of subjects discussed. It was a nice plus that there were bonus materials, such as interviews and conferences. The staff was active in the forum as well, guiding, reassuring, advising, answering questions and intervening gently to make sure the discussions remained at an academic level. Professor Hosli and her team of Leiden University put a lot of time and effort in it, and it made the course a truly rewarding and shiny sample of university study at its best.

However, I was unfamiliar with requirements for specific types of writing, such as a case study or an op-ed, and since I got my certificate with distinction (96.3%), I can say that this course really teaches you how to write. Professor Comer is very passionate about her subject and her lectures are clear and informative. She has carefully selected reading materials and developed a very thorough and clear course structure. It was great to have precise instructions and prompt staff support all the time. The workshops via Google Hangouts were extremely useful. The forum community was terrific - so many encouraging and friendly people, a lot of support, learning and fun. As for peer review, my impression is that as the course progressed, all of us got better at doing it and most grades were justified and fair. I especially liked that we submitted drafts before the final version - it was very helpful. If you decide to take this course, bear in mind fixed deadlines - we had to submit something every Monday. It is also important to know that the course is not about English grammar or vocabulary - if you are looking for something basic, Crafting a Successful Writer, also offered by Coursera, may be a better choice. However, I'd definitely recommend the course to those who want to write better from the point of view of text organization and content.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>7</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>227</course_id><course_title>Online Games: Literature, New Media, and Narrative</course_title><school>School:  Vanderbilt University</school><review_data_id>114081</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Kristina Šekrst</reviewer_name><other_review_count>64</other_review_count><other_course_completed>64</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/sekrst</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-10-08</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I took this course by accident, and I'm glad I did. The course is presented in an interesting way - a blend of lectures and discussions. There is a class group consisting of graduate students, who are each giving opinions about certain literary work, narrative genres or video games, so you feel as if you're a part of that discussion. The practical part of the course focuses on playing Lord of the Rings Online, and this course got me addicted to that world, so that's a +1 star for it as well! The professor was enthusiastic, had a nice sense of humor, and was very active in the forums. His love towards literature and online games was contagious, and there were really fun assignments regarding playing LOTRO, that felt you weren't in a course - you were just having fun. But I've learned new things, even though I had background in literary theory, and, most importantly, I've read new literary work, which were a nice example of the theoretical discussions of the course. I'm giving a huge recommendation for anyone who wants to see an interdisciplinary approach to online gaming (gaming is optional, but it's really a fun experience), and to brush up (or learn as a beginner) your comparative literature skills.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50038</course_id><course_title>Introductory Human Physiology</course_title><school>School:  Duke University</school><review_data_id>121390</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Sakares Saengkaew</reviewer_name><other_review_count>2</other_review_count><other_course_completed>2</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/sakares</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-05-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>My prior reason to take this course is wondering how our body functions since I was in the training for marathon run.

The descriptions are limited in a few areas, but this is understandable due to the complexities involved. It answered a number of questions I had about how the body works and many more I never even thought to ask. The instructor moves slowly and carefully through the material so it nearly impossible to get lost. Definitely one of the better taught classes here.

Otherwise this is a GREAT course because it is very informative, well presented and you could make better decisions on your choice of meat consumption after the course. I learnt a lot. I appreciate the openness and frank comments presented and the discussions. There is a quiz at the end of each lecture and a final project presentation which is compulsory for those who wanted to achieve the certificate of completion with distinction. The final project is the prime cut as it reinforces  what  I learnt throughout the course and allows us to view a variety of ways how the different meat is cooked, eaten and presented. I certainly recommend this course as it is informative and ends with a bang! After the last lecture, I went out to celebrate with a meat feast.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>44777</course_id><course_title>Genome Sequencing (Bioinformatics II)</course_title><school>School:  University of California, San Diego</school><review_data_id>119967</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Steven Frank</reviewer_name><other_review_count>39</other_review_count><other_course_completed>38</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/stevenfrank</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-03-31</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This second installment of the six-part bioinformatics series focuses on sequencing. Gene and protein sequences are the axis around which all of biology turns, and the scale of the Human Genome Project gives a sense of how central a role computational analysis plays. What this course covers is well captured by the "exploding newspaper problem" -- how do you reconstruct the news from a newspaper that's been blown to smithereens? How can you reconstruct a huge DNA molecule from the short segments that can be generated and read? These are problems in graph theory, and this course provides a great introduction to what might otherwise seem esoteric and abstract by grounding theory in the practicalities of biology. As in all courses in this series, there's a "biologist" track and a "hacker" track, and for the latter, the programming assignments can be considerably more challenging than those in Bioinformatics I. But they're fun -- it's very cool to see how graph theory works a kind of magic on problems whose scale makes them seem hopeless. Once again, the interactive textbook is excellent and the lectures, while worthwhile, are not essential. When most people think of bioinformatics, they probably think of gene sequencing, and this course is a great hands-on intro to the topic.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45431</course_id><course_title>Molecular Evolution (Bioinformatics IV)</course_title><school>School:  University of California, San Diego</school><review_data_id>120201</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Steven Frank</reviewer_name><other_review_count>39</other_review_count><other_course_completed>38</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/stevenfrank</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-04-10</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is, by far, the most difficult segment I've encountered in this course series (having taken parts I through V). It addresses two fascinating high-level questions in biology: how do we know what evolved from what, and why does T. rex look so much like a chicken? That first question has very practical implications in identifying the animal source of viruses such as the SARS pathogen, but answering it requires a deep dive into the challenging topics of phylogenies and evolutionary trees. Here the hacker track offers up some pretty serious ruts and bumps, with problems that may have you forgetting about the biological dimension altogether as you ponder leaves and limbs and other rarefied artifacts of graph theory that can be pretty tough to turn into working code. Then it's a sudden turn into the world of computational proteomics, which re-introduces mass spectrometry (originally covered in part I) but with newer and hairier twists. Once again the broader biological questions dissolve somewhat in the technical details of analyzing spectra (and more graph theory), but spectrometry is itself such a basic analytical tool for quantitative biologists that you never feel too far removed from the science. Overall, this course segment is tough, but also rewarding once you bend all that graph theory to your will -- and forewarned is forearmed.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45401</course_id><course_title>Genomic Data Science and Clustering (Bioinformatics V)</course_title><school>School:  University of California, San Diego</school><review_data_id>120204</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Steven Frank</reviewer_name><other_review_count>39</other_review_count><other_course_completed>38</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/stevenfrank</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-04-10</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This fifth installment of the UCSD bioinformatics series is surprisingly short -- only two weeks of material, less than half that of most other installments. The biological topic is how we infer which genes orchestrate various processes in a cell. It continues concepts first introduced in part III -- gene duplications and genome rearrangements. Here the primary focus is on clustering techniques to identify genes likely to be expressed and regulated together and, therefore, collectively responsible for a particular biological phenomenon. These techniques, including k-means clustering, the E-M algorithm, and hierarchical and distance-based clustering, are interesting and lend themselves to straightforward coding. There's a fair bit of material covered in two weeks, but still, it's only two weeks, and in my session you had six weeks to complete the assignments. Depending on how the courses are scheduled, this one can readily be taken in tandem with one of the others.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>12749</course_id><course_title>Marine Megafauna: An Introduction to Marine Science and Conservation</course_title><school>School:  Duke University</school><review_data_id>7409</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Lee Chia</reviewer_name><other_review_count>4</other_review_count><other_course_completed>2</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/leechia</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-03-23</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I enjoy this course very much, although I have no background of marine science.

As a foster and adopted "mom" to a variety of animals, I took this course in hopes of expanding my knowledge in order to someday foster or adopt horses/ponies. I came from a very limited/almost zero knowledge of horses and finished the course with a lot of knowledge and confidence that I could feed a proper diet to horses and ponies, even some with special needs. The material was presented in an easy-to-grasp manner and the PDF slides were very helpful. I really loved the (non-graded) revision quizzes as a prep for the graded quizzes! Dr Jo-Anne Murray, the instructor, was personable and I appreciated the time she and the rest of the team ~ Jayne Roberts, Wendy Watson, Joan Kulifay, and Dr Anne Stevenson ~ put into the course and the course forum answering questions and creating a pleasant environment. The only "complaint" I might have is that Dr Murray seemed a little stiff in front of the camera. Her class communications via the forums and in the weekly briefings were very positive, engaging and encouraging and I would have loved to have seen that express itself more vibrantly in the video lectures. She obviously knows her subject well, so seeing her speak a little more spontaneously would have been a treat and would have made the course a touch more engaging. Her delivery was professional and the slides and class information presented were thorough and helped me to feel like less of an absolute beginner and more prepared to take on the challenge of caring for a horse. I would gladly take further courses on this subject from Dr Murray and her team. Highly recommended for anyone seeking to expand knowledge on horses and ponies or anyone generally seeking more knowledge. As for the University of Edinburgh ~ this is the fourth course I've taken from University of Edinburgh and I've found all of the courses fun and interesting. I'm highly impressed with this institution and its instructors. Looking forward to more courses from them in the future.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>2</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>44021</course_id><course_title>Sagas and Space - Thinking Space in Viking Age and Medieval Scandinavia</course_title><school>School:  University of Zurich</school><review_data_id>111622</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Joanna</reviewer_name><other_review_count>6</other_review_count><other_course_completed>6</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/tzigi</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-08-15</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I won't hesitate to name it as the best MOOC I have ever taken. Each week was run by different specialists (under the supervision of the main team) and it showed that the staff tried their hardest (and succeeded) to find the best specialist in each area. The course was demanding intellectually if not in the domain of time requirements - 5 hours a week seemed reasonable to me.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50581</course_id><course_title>HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers</course_title><school>School:  Johns Hopkins University</school><review_data_id>119434</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-03-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This challenging course is jam-packed with good information. There is so much to learn that eight weeks would be more manageable than four. I am re-taking the course because I didn't have time to watch all the lectures, which cover everything from synchronizing local folders with Github to understanding how vertical margins collapse in CSS. It is best to take notes, because you may forget the correct syntax for browsersync in your command line, or git commands, or how to use box-sizing.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>51837</course_id><course_title>Coaching Practices</course_title><school>School:  University of California, Davis</school><review_data_id>122521</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Dmytro Sawochkin</reviewer_name><other_review_count>28</other_review_count><other_course_completed>24</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/dmitry24</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-07-06</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Finally, the course with practical material. The previous 2 courses in the specialization was more or less interesting, but mostly I considered them a waste of time, cause it contained explanations, theoretical materials and some general tips without concrete live examples. This course, at least it's second part, contains a lot of practical issues, examples and tips you can really use. It's still not perfect, cause mechanics of coaching is not perfectly presented, but I can wholeheartedly give 5 stars to the course.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50824</course_id><course_title>Energy 101: The Big Picture</course_title><school>School:  Georgia Institute of Technology</school><review_data_id>119317</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Vladimir Vasilina</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/vladimir23</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-03-13</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>To my mind, this course is a good start to explore energy and sustainability issues.

It is taught by world-renowned professors. The quality of the lectures is perfect. There are slides to download, it is easy to take notes. It covers a variety of topics related to climate change. Unlike other on-line courses, it feels like a real university class; you have to write essays, learn the material very well, apply critical thinking when taking the weekly quizzes. I, personally, already knew a lot of the things covered in the lectures; that is why for me the course was of medium difficulty. Some people, however, who have no background in science and economics, may find it a little more difficult.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>44778</course_id><course_title>Comparing Genes, Proteins, and Genomes (Bioinformatics III)</course_title><school>School:  University of California, San Diego</school><review_data_id>120163</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Steven Frank</reviewer_name><other_review_count>39</other_review_count><other_course_completed>38</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/stevenfrank</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-04-08</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Having learned to sequence genes in the last course segment, this installment focuses on how to compare them -- an often-difficult task because a meaningful comparison must consider the possibility of mutations, sharply increasing the complexity of the task. How do you "align" sequences that have unlimited potential for variation? The solution is to be found in "dynamic programming," a powerful technique that is well-presented here. The text and programming assignments are more challenging than those of the earlier course segments, but they are taught clearly and progressively, and the staff is fabulous (I'm talking about you, Giampaolo Eusebi!). Graph theory can be esoteric and abstract, but when anchored to interesting problems in biology, it becomes a lot of fun. The course also covers rearrangements within genes and genomes, leading to ways to compare, say, human and mouse genomes, and more kinds of computational graphs. The questions addressed in this course segment continue to be interesting biologically and now are more challenging computationally. It's all good.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>3240</course_id><course_title>Nanotechnology and Nanosensors</course_title><school>School:  Technion - Israel Institute of Technology</school><review_data_id>29760</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Avigdor Neeman</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>0</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/avigdorneeman</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-04-22</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Coming from an Electrical Engineering/computer science background I needed to catch up/brush up on some chemistry terminology.. Otherwise, the course dos not require prerequisites. The course comes with video lectures as well as an online textbook. Additional material and research is needed in order to successfully complete the quizzes, assignments and final project. For those that authenticate the Coursea and the Technion are providing a certificate of completion. While the quizzes are graded automatically the assignments and final project ( done in groups of 4) are peer reviewed. Overall a very good course and an excellent investment for those that want to be part of the nanotechnology and in particular nanosensors revolution.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69762</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Complex Analysis</course_title><school>School:  Wesleyan University</school><review_data_id>123081</review_data_id><reviewer_name/><other_review_count>22</other_review_count><other_course_completed>19</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/hannaedwards1</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-07-24</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I am glad that i have selfstudied Calculus-3 with some Multivariable Calculus and Mathematical Thinking before taking this course . Thus far i am impressed by the course content which is a lot larger than i thought and i would recommend to have a minimum of 10 hours per week to fully appreciate the content of the 5 weekly lectures and do some work on your own . The teaching employs the solving of peer reviewed problems as a learning-to-do-mathematics tool which teach certain topics better than anything else could ! I love that i have to sit back with pen and paper all one my own and analyse a complex ;) problem and have nothing but myself to rely on .

Utilizing expansions , the present series offers a look into functions and mathematics previously learned and teaches new methods of tackling problems . The series is accompanied by a course-wiki which i would recommend everyone to study next to the lectures , and lectures are packed full of content (no time wasted) and are better watched at a slow pace .

This course was my first experience with bioinformatics. You really should have a decent understanding of Python before going in though. This course holds your hand throughout the course, but that's perfect for someone with no experience in bioinformatics. It introduces you to a lot of the major topics in bioinformatics in a way that is friendly to complete beginners, but doesn't make it so basic that you're bored. The weekly assignments require that you know basic coding, but not enough to make it impossible for someone that just learned Python. I would definitely recommend this course as an introduction to bioinformatics after one has learned Python.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>1176</course_id><course_title>Roman Architecture</course_title><school>School:  Yale University</school><review_data_id>33003</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jim Humelsine</reviewer_name><other_review_count>7</other_review_count><other_course_completed>7</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/jimhumelsine</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-05-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Since taking Latin in high school, I have always loved all things Roman. Dr. Kleiner's course was not an exception. This 15 week course covers Roman architecture from Romulus' hut to Constantine's Arch. It follows how Roman architecture evolved as the Roman era progressed and Rome's influence circled the Mediterranean. Dr. Kleiner's lectures are filled with photos and diagrams giving many examples of what the Romans built and explaining the context of the structures. My only criticism is that our essay assignments were restricted to too few words. I highly recommend Roman Architecture for anyhow who has been to Rome and fallen in love with it, or anyone who has plans to go to Italy and Rome. Viewing Dr. Kleiner's videos will definitely help one appreciate the experience of visiting Roman sites in person. One does not have to wait for the next Coursera session.

The course is really well planed and has an incredible starter code to work on. I would like to address one thing mentioned in some reviews: since the authors were focused on creating the best possible resources for the main topic of the course (and they did it remarkably well), some other data structures used in graphs (such as HashSet and PriorityQueues) seemed poorly covered, and hence it seemed there is a lack of resources for the course. But in my opinion, this was not a big issue, anyone interested could have found a bunch of free online resources. It is unrealistic to expect that the course should cover all the accompanying topics, they are just too broad. Consequently, I also had to learn a bit of JavaFX to add a feature for the extension project, and at first, the whole application seemed overwhelming, but in just a couple of days studying the code, I was able to make the necessary changes. Otherwise, the course covers exactly what is described in its description. The only remark I have is the lack of programming assignments in the fourth week. But I am sure this can and will be easily fixed in some of the future course offerings. To conclude, based only on the knowledge I had before the course, and the knowledge I have now, this course deserves nothing less than a 5-star rating.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>19238</course_id><course_title>Bioinformatics: Life Sciences on Your Computer</course_title><school>School:  Johns Hopkins University</school><review_data_id>42002</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Aarthi Mohan</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/aarthimohan</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-07-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course is  well structured with slides (additional materials) usually packed with right amount of content.

She even got access to databases as a result of special requests from passionate students! I had taken statistics in college, and am familiar with reading professional journals, so this material was familiar to me. However, statistics software and using such databases was brand new to me. Professor Dierker made learning SAS quite easy as she guided us through it, giving us the option of just copying and modifying the code, or really understanding what she was saying about how it worked. We had a great, collaborative community in the few short weeks of the course. We shared links to our tumblr.com blogs where we showed our progress during every week of the course. We used the discussion forums to ask for help by giving our blog links. Speaking of the discussion forums, Professor Dierker was on them daily. She took a sabbatical to teach this course, so she seemed to live in the discussion forums. This added a LOT to the value of the course. I wonder if we depended too heavily on her availability. She was passionately driven toward our success. I wish wish wish I could continue to use SAS. I found some projects that would be great to work on with such software. I found that it costs thousands of dollars per year for a single non-business user! The alternative is a free program called R. I have tried several coursera courses to learn the language, and have not yet found one that works for me. Professor Dierker, please come back and teach a similar course using R :)</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>189</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Digital Sound Design</course_title><school>School:  Emory University</school><review_data_id>1398</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Barbara</reviewer_name><other_review_count>8</other_review_count><other_course_completed>7</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/Barbara</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-04-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Excellent course that covers everything from the basics of sound to the complexities of MIDI and other forms of digital music. The professor has an top notch grasp on the subject matter and does a great job of explaining it in a way that even somebody with only a little bit of musical experience can understand. The course works more like a college course than other Coursera courses. The course grade is based on scores from a midterm and a final exam that can only be taken once each. The tests were straightforward although the wording on a question or two of the questions made picking the answer harder than it should have been. The only hesitation I have about recommending this course is that the instructor clears his throat alot, sometimes to the point of distraction. I was able to overlook it because I was focused on learning the material but it proved too distracting for one of my friends.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50480</course_id><course_title>Model Thinking</course_title><school>School:  University of Michigan</school><review_data_id>118164</review_data_id><reviewer_name>kr strug</reviewer_name><other_review_count>9</other_review_count><other_course_completed>8</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/krzysztofstrug</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-02-04</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Very good way of learning how different, everyfay situations can be mathematically presented and solved.

It features lectures not only on philosophy of science and history of space missions, but it gves a nice commentary on the current technological state as well. There are lectures on Solar System, where you can find out about planets and moons, and basic astrobiological terminology, which is then further investigated in later lectures. There is also a lecture on telescopes, which is really useful for techies, and the techniques for finding exoplanets are discussed as well. All in all, the most comprehensive introduction to astronomy online, and the most fun one. It's perfect for beginners, and it's great for experts trying to find better teaching methods.

This compact class consists of seven units that each include lecture segments totaling about an hour, readings, and a tour of places and institutions central to Jefferson’s life or its study today. These tours are no mere travelogue – Jefferson’s life and philosophy are so intimately associated with his Monticello estate and the “academical village” he designed for U.Va. that to experience them, in well-produced videos with insightful commentary, connects you to the man even as reading his letters and other writings connects you to his mind. Professor Onuf is a wonderful teacher. His lectures are absorbing and well- delivered, often passionately so. The most compelling feature of this course is his focus on Jefferson’s ideas rather than dates and events. Prof. Onuf covers Jefferson’s vision of America’s revolutionary promise and later Americans’ evolving views of Jefferson; the political philosophy that informed Jefferson’s draft of the Declaration of Independence; his heterodox views on education (primary purpose: to sustain the American experiment) and religion (deeply suspicious of organized “priestcraft”); and Prof. Onuf does not shy away from Jefferson’s provocative views on race and slavery. The readings, usually Jefferson’s own words in letters and public documents, nicely complement the lectures; they are short and very well chosen. Students who take this class will acquire, in a short time, an understanding of Jefferson – the man and the mind – that has real staying power. Everyday encounters with politics, education and even architecture will have you contemplating Prof. Onuf’s rhetorical question: “Is it Jeffersonian?” This brief, enjoyable immersion into the essential Jefferson packs an outsize pedagogical punch.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50829</course_id><course_title>Database Management Essentials</course_title><school>School:  University of Colorado System</school><review_data_id>116372</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Mirza Ibrahimovic</reviewer_name><other_review_count>8</other_review_count><other_course_completed>7</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/mirzaibrahimovic</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-12-03</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The videos are short and clear.

I was thrilled to see professor Curie as well again. All in all, a great lecturer, amazing graphics, and the most awesome real-life fossils from the University of Alberta. This course continues Dino 101 in more detail, focusing on Theropoda dinosaurs, and describing their evolution into birds we know today. You'll learn a lot about anatomy, hunting habits, life conditions and novelties these species have manifested, and you'll learn that everything you know about dinosaurs is probably incorrect. I'd recommend this course anytime, and I'd recommend you to take the whole paleontology series, including Dino 101, since this is one of the best things the Internet can offer. I have always been amazed by the quality of production of Dino 101, and this continues the great trend of engaging videos and AMAZING notes - which are like small encyclopedias.

They offered NUMEROUS videos, meet-ups, and online texts to meet our personal learning styles and levels of expertise. They lead us to use visual media with our writing as we learned more about writing rhetorically. Ohio State University created a website to supplement coursera. It was marvelous for encouraging better peer reviews. I had dropped a half dozen coursera courses previously, because the peer reviews were so disappointing. I put hours of work into giving my classmates respectful, constructive feedback, and received short, cheap, sniping comments. This was still an issue with this course, but much less so. The instructors also offered "Level Up" challenges for people who wanted to approach the week's topic from different angles. They put us in the discussion forums during the first two weeks with assignments that were like "getting to know you" exercises. The discussion forums provided the feedback that I needed. I didn't realize that I longed for and really needed it. I discovered that this feedback made my writing grow like it was on hormones. The assignments turned into online publishing opportunities, and lead to the connections that many of us continue today, several months later. The discussion forums continued to be active for some time after the course ended. They didn't close them until 8 months after the course ended, and students had reliably replaced them on other platforms like email, google+, wordpress and facebook. I have enjoyed writing as long as I can remember. Now, with more confidence than ever, I enjoy sharing my writing.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>51419</course_id><course_title>Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science</course_title><school>School:  Johns Hopkins University</school><review_data_id>121339</review_data_id><reviewer_name/><other_review_count>9</other_review_count><other_course_completed>9</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/alecmchiu</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-05-23</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course is what thought how to use bash programming and the shell in the world of bioinformatics.

My experience is with the original format,which covered analysis of industry structure, firm capabilities, competitive dynamics, and determining competitive positioning and firm scope. Prof. Lenox is an excellent teacher, and unlike many business courses, this one neither shies away from the underlying microeconomics of business enterprises nor overemphasizes it -- that is, the presentation isn't quantitative but it's solidly grounded in theory. Prof. Lenox is especially good at tying abstract concepts to real cases, and each week's case study further focuses the material on historical business situations. This is truly valuable because concepts such as SWOT and Five Forces analyses can easily become arbitrary exercises in speculation unless you see how they're used in practical decisionmaking. I found the final project particularly worthwhile, and had fun using Coursera as my case study.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50555</course_id><course_title>Mastering the Software Engineering Interview</course_title><school>School:  University of California, San Diego</school><review_data_id>118851</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jeanne Boyarsky</reviewer_name><other_review_count>33</other_review_count><other_course_completed>29</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/boyarsky</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-02-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The videos were great as were the discussion forums and instructor interaction.

I audited the course (didn't do any of the assignments). I did read the assignments and they look good - especially for someone new to the field. Why did I rate the provider so low? First, if you audit the course, you get pestered with emails and comments every time you log in about "don't give up" and "you are running behind; maybe you want to join the next course". Second, there were issues with the assignment reported in the forum and the professors made the decision to allow 1% to be the passing score. That doesn't sound encouraging. I dropped the class in the last week because I got the gist of the discussions and was tired of the "reminders" to register for the next section and try again.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>51322</course_id><course_title>Calculus: Single Variable Part 3 - Integration</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>119764</review_data_id><reviewer_name/><other_review_count>22</other_review_count><other_course_completed>19</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/hannaedwards1</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-03-28</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I took this series before it was broken up into 5 parts .

Each week groups countries together and discusses their history, economies, composition and legal frameworks to allow students to be more informed about each country's circumstances. it is fascinating. Some video lectures are up to 50 minutes each. A few hours of videos are present per week over ten weeks. The lecturer is erudite, and makes many interesting recommendations for further reading around the subjects. there are two written assignments (short) required over and beyond the usual fare of quiz based assessments.

If you want to learn the principals of critical thinking, take the "Think Again" course - that one is a great, thorough learning experience. This course is unbelievably short (10-20 minutes of video per week), with ridiculously simple exercises in the beginning and incredibly... uncritical exercises in the end. You can mount a case against every single answer required in most quizzes. One of the things that the "Think Again" course teaches you is that when you evaluate arguments you should put them in the most flattering form possible. If you want to criticise a position, criticize the strongest possible formulation of that position. In this course we are basically taught (by example) to do the opposite - ridicule opposite positions and summarily dismiss them. You should also be able to identify the problems with your own positions so that you hold them out of reason and not prejudice. Again, this course teaches the opposite, by only providing texts for students to criticize that defend the position the lecturers disagree with (with some honorable exceptions). Particularly terrible in this sense were some one-sided applications to "global challenges". The one on climate change can only be considered acceptable by uncritical individuals who want to hear their preconceptions validated at any cost - which may be fine, but not in a classroom. The lecturer uses terms like "deniers", "stupid" and "dishonest" to qualify either individuals or positions held by individuals who disagree with anthropogenic climate change theories. This sort of application is in fact in contradiction with the very same principles of critical thought supposedly addressed in this course. It is a true mess. Maybe the course will change during future offerings, and if so you may want to check it out. If it does not, forget about it. It's a shame and it makes the great University of Edinburgh look bad - other courses from this institution are pretty good.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>101</course_id><course_title>Critical Thinking in Global Challenges</course_title><school>School:  The University of Edinburgh</school><review_data_id>7407</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Gabriel Candal</reviewer_name><other_review_count>18</other_review_count><other_course_completed>14</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/gabriel</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-03-23</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>For someone who already studied Philosophy in high school, this is not new material; nevertheless, the world would be a better place if everyone knew the basics on identifying (and producing) credible arguments.

The course is divided by 6 thematic weeks, with one mid-term break allowing for catching up with the material. You start off with Week 1, in a gentle way that takes you through the course structure and requirements and introduces the basic concepts of the Social Psychology, concluding with fun overview of the basic concepts, which contrasts with what I saw in other courses. You also take your first assignment, easier than other tasks you will have to complete, which helps you understand and apply the principles behind random assignment and sampling, concepts frequently used during the lectures and readings. Weeks 2, 3, 4 and 6 are the challenging ones, full of lectures, readings, assigned videos and assignments. This is the core of the course where you learn about yourself, social impression, obedience, group processes as well as conflict, peace and terrorism. Week 7 is somewhat more light-hearted, with only one small reading and treats us with research about happiness and life satisfaction. It is clear that the structure of the course and its topics were very well thought through, to maximise the potential of the students in order to reach the goal. By the end of Week 6, I was a bit de-motivated by workload, hence the idea of a somewhat lighter week was appealing. The lectures are extremely well designed, with frequent pop-up questions checking understanding. The professor is engaging and almost every lecture contains a humorous element helping recall and review the information. The instructions on what needs to be done at every stage of the course are clear and detailed, something I didn't see on any of the other courses. There is an extensive optional reading list attached to every lecture clip although you might need to have a log-in to academic institutions to view some of them. The readings (approximately 30-40 pages a week, with some weeks having considerably more readings than others) either review or complement lecture material in a coherent way. The exception I found was the first reading in a first week (Introduction to social psychology), which contained a lot of new information (understandable at the beginning of the course). This information was, however, expanded in subsequent video lectures in later weeks. The course benefits from extensive free resources such as the most famous psychological experiments ever done (videos), chapters from the renowned books, supplemental material provided during the catch-up week and the expense-paid trip to see Jane Goodall for the Day of Compassion winner. The Snapshot Quiz taken at the beginning of the course provides us with personalised experience as our initial views are constantly being brought up to our attention during the course itself. At the end, we can compare how much we've learned during the course. The assignments are challenging and well structured. The peer review for most of them worked well and the decision to grade the assignment based on the median (not mean) of the grades your peers provide ensured that the unfairness is limited to the minimum. All the written assignments specifically ask to provide relevant references to at least three social psychology phenomena you had learned during the week (and the weeks before) when the assignment was given. The last assignment, the Day of Compassion, was aimed at synthesising what we had learned in order to do something good for the society. In order to improve, I would prefer that the grading of this assignment did not contain a subjective criterion of an 'impact' that our assignment had on others. The course ends with a final exam (50%) based on multiple choice questions. I found it an exciting way on checking upon my understanding, although it would be fairer to replace it with an open-book paper / tasks instead. The course would further benefit from occasional quizzes or applying the knowledge in smaller open-ended problems that could be incorporated into final grading. The discussion boards were exploding from the range of information (apparently this was the biggest on-line course ever created in terms of its participants), yet they were well managed by the professor and the TAs. I found them helpful, active and engaged. The true 'cherry on the cake' was the Extra Credit Assignment that included on-line study groups where the group of randomly assigned students discussed the pre-prepared topics via Google Hangout. The truly international community enriched the course and provided me with an enlightening experience where my own views were challenged and our cultural differences were exposed. I only regret that the course does not have its advanced version. I learned a lot and applied this knowledge in the assignments. I also found out that I am (occasionally) able to apply it in my daily life, making my personal and professional relationships way better than they were in the past. The workload of this course is bigger than stated on the website. I spent on average 20 hours every week on this course, on top of my full-time job; however I topped it up with optional readings found on Google Scholar thanks to the reference list at the end of every lecture. I would predict that 12-15 hours per week should be enough to do well on this course.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>29</course_id><course_title>Statistics One</course_title><school>School:  Princeton University</school><review_data_id>114809</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Livia Petrickova</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/livia2</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-10-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I wish Prof. Conway was the first teacher I met in my student life.

At that time, the forums were overshadowed by people who seemed to have some kind of personal vendetta against professor Conway. It was really sad to see. There is a programming tool called 'R' that you will need to learn. It is very easy to learn. It is used by statisticians all over the world. I think too many people didn't have an understanding of the mathematics and other skills needed for a statistics class. (even an introductory one) Having said that, I think this was a great introduction to statistics. I like the real world examples he used.

There were still a few outstanding issues, but staff was quick to either fix them or suggest a way around them. * Lots of exercises Dislikes: * Videos. The prof stands in front of the PowerPoint and reads from the slides. I'm not typically one to skip the lectures and read the course notes, but I found there was little reason to watch the videos in the end. * Provided Python modules. I often found them frustrating to work with. As an example, the vector and matrix classes include labels for their columns and rows. This adds extra overhead when creating and manipulating those objects – if you want to multiply a matrix M by a vector v, i.e. M*v, not only does vector v need to have the same number of rows as M does columns, as one would expect, but the labels of the rows of v have to match the labels of the columns of M. There never seemed to be any payoff for this added complexity. Suggestions: * I think there's a missed opportunity for visualisations. There are lots of compelling examples of linear algebra applications in 2-D and 3-D that could be rendered to the screen. * Drop the column/row labels for matrices and vectors.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>188</course_id><course_title>Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra through Computer Science Applications</course_title><school>School:  Brown University</school><review_data_id>71309</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jeff Winchell</reviewer_name><other_review_count>91</other_review_count><other_course_completed>66</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/jeffwinchell1</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-02-20</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>Unlike the previous 14 reviews, this is about the second iteration of the class. From what I can tell, the professor has made a fair amount of changes addressing some of the complaints in the other reviews (and the 14 reviews averaged 4 stars, so the complaints aren't that major). As this is only my first week, I set the star ratings for content and instructor are set to average until I can better assess the course (and whether I need to look at any videos or not). I've taken python and linear algebra MOOCs before, which is good because this class takes a lot of time to do well in. I see that the professor has upped the time estimates from 4-5 hours/week in the first iteration of this MOOC to 7-10 hours per week for this one. Maybe 7-10 is OK if you want to get 60% on every single assignment (a requirement for a certificate), but if you want to shoot higher, most people will need even more time. I'm only finishing up the first week of assignments, I've watched no lectures and I'm guessing I'm up to 15+ hours. I like that a community TA has set up a thread for each problem in the assignments. An even better improvement on that would be to also include a link on the assignments page to such a structure (e.g. the Pattern Discovery in Data Mining MOOC on Coursera has links on a weekly page which lists each video and a button linking to a subforum for that video). If you want to be able to get a certificate while missing or not completing most of some assignments, you are out of luck. I've never seen that in a MOOC before. Since I want to do very well in this course, I'm biting the bullet and spending a lot more time than I had planned, to do this. I think for MOOCs which are taken mostly by people who are non-full time college students, the professor should split this up into multiple MOOCs so he can lengthen the course time and reduce the weekly work load.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>97</course_id><course_title>Computer Networks</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>37440</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Pavel Klammert</reviewer_name><other_review_count>11</other_review_count><other_course_completed>9</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/pavelklammert</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-07-02</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>The course itself is fine (nothing special btw), it presents the way today's technology works (i don't find it very suited for newbies(.

So, if there's no prior background, this might not be the case for you, since it's more math-oriented rather than computer science-oriented. There are a lot of proofs, and interesting discussion problems that have been posted every week, and solved in the forums. There are two programming assignments as well, so this is a nice combination of theory and practice. Discussion forums were very useful, and professor was active in these as well. I came to this class after finishing the Mining Massive Datasets one, which I extremely enjoyed, and I've put the Automata on my watchlist, and it certainly was not a mistake.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>20</course_id><course_title>Automata</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>113690</review_data_id><reviewer_name/><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>0</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/hali10840</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-09-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>i just started this subject ,the content ,instructor and provider are good they are very helpful to learn Automata</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>20</course_id><course_title>Automata</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>70729</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Juzer Ali</reviewer_name><other_review_count>2</other_review_count><other_course_completed>2</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/juzerali</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-02-15</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>This course is not for the weak at heart. If you don't have prior knowledge you will find very very hard to follow lectures. But if you are patient enough, you will eventually get it. As other reviews have pointed out last couple of weeks are rushed through and 6 weeks is not enough to get a good grasp of the subject. You need good understanding of formal proof to follow the lectures.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>13</course_id><course_title>Probabilistic Graphical Models</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>73437</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-03-14</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Course contents are highly standard and topics are very useful and advanced but the course prerequisite very good knowledge on these topics.

After finishing week 4, I can safely say that I know what are Bayesian Networks and Markov Random Fields, how and when to use them, and why they work. I have a feeling that the course is taught very clearly - What once seemed to me like difficult concepts suddenly seem actually fairly simple - which is definitely a result of the quality of the teaching. This is NOT an easy course by all means - Each week has around 3 hours of lectures which are not very easy - It takes me about 5 hours to complete them. There is a quiz after each lecture which takes me around 30 minutes to complete, and the programming exercises require you implement fully the data structures and algorithms. For me this means that each week I need to spend around 10 hours on the programming exercises, so overall I would say the course requires ~15 hours of work each week, for someone with a similar background as me. I would imagine that for people who are new to computer science or machine learning, this would probably be a VERY challenging course - It does not make any discounts since its an online course, and I would say it is a graduate level Stanford course. My background: I have an Msc. in Computational Biology, and some programming experience in Matlab and R. I have a relatively sound statistical understanding, and this is not the first time I deal with graphical models, but is the the first time I study it in depth. I am doing the course 2 years after it was first run - It is too bad that you can't join it at any given point - it would have been nice to get a Coursera certificate for completing the course, as right now I get my exercises graded, but then I'm told that I don't get an official grade since I'm past the deadline... Though as I'm in it to learn, it doesn't really matter to me.

Probably, some students had incorrectly estimated the difficulty and/or practical importance of the course. The course is probably one of the most challenging ones in Coursera both in terms of workload and theoretical depth. I used to spend 15+ hours per week (though it was 9-week long during the first run), and I doubt anyone could complete it successfully without basic Matlab knowledge or without prior exposure to machine learning or statistics (would be very difficult to catch up given the workload). I was a PhD student in a related field while taking the course, still the course gave me a lot of knowledge. It contains several advanced topics that are not always covered by alternative courses or books (like learning of graphical model structure). Comprehensive programming assignments (reminding small research problems) and quizzes help to make yourself really familiar with the topics. Some people even made T-shirts with a caption “I survived PA5” — that was an assignment on Gibbs sampling, was challenging indeed, but the experience was that rewarding. Some PA’s really require figuring out the data structures involved, but this is a compromise between having students developing complex software from scratch and spending reasonable amount of time. Daphne, as Coursera co-founder, made her best to show the capabilities of the platform (it was one of the first MOOCs). Unlike some other courses, you feel like you are really taking a quality graduate- level course comparable (though not identical) to the ones the author teaches at her university. To sum up, prospective students should take into account that the course is quite advanced (vs. introductory), academic (vs. practical), and demanding (vs. laid-back), when deciding whether it fits their goals.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>4</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>102</course_id><course_title>E-learning and Digital Cultures</course_title><school>School:  The University of Edinburgh</school><review_data_id>51731</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Maryna Lagereva</reviewer_name><other_review_count>5</other_review_count><other_course_completed>4</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/marynalagereva</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-08-19</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>The course offered a very intresting perspective for analyzing e-learning and digital cultures, however, I disliked the fact that actually there were no lectures.

In other words, the course was good at provoking various thoughts and ideas about advantages and disadvantages of the e-learning, but it didn't teach me anything.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>102</course_id><course_title>E-learning and Digital Cultures</course_title><school>School:  The University of Edinburgh</school><review_data_id>41124</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jodi Millard</reviewer_name><other_review_count>5</other_review_count><other_course_completed>3</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/jodimillard</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-07-07</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>This course does an excellent job of creating a strong and engaged community.

The intro videos are well connected with the course content and provide a better understanding of their host institutions and of the instructors. The curated videos and resources were very interesting and helpful. This course makes strong connections between philosophy, popular culture, technology, and learning, which is great since most people I talk to are not educational technologists, but faculty members. The weekly Hangouts on Air added a very nice touch to the course, providing the kind of discussions academics have among one another. I also felt that the instructors were responsive in reading and commenting on student work. I like the fact that there were no quizzes and deadlines and such, just a capstone digital artifact to produce. I have enough going on in my life without having to deal with the extra pressure of completing MOOC quizzes in time.

It doesn't come naturally, as most people believe - the language and structure of papers are very peculiar, and there are certain expectations that reviewers and editors have that we'll sooner or later clash with. This course is a magnificent piece of work. It explains very clearly all the basics (and even some advanced tricks) needed to write quality papers. More than that, it gives the essentials for quality writing in English. It includes lots of training (writing and reviewing other people's writing), so it's very engaging. The best thing I can say about it is that after taking it I looked back at some papers I had written as a young PhD that were rejected by several journals - and now I know exactly why. They look like school reports and not like scientific papers.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>76</course_id><course_title>Neural Networks for Machine Learning</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>123973</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-08-21</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Hinton is brilliant, concise, succint, clear.

Course content includes binary logic, C basics, C structs and arrays, x86 assembly, the stack and heap, caches, processes, virtual memory, memory allocation and differences between Java and C. The course consists of lecture videos with periodic in-lecture questions and several programming exercises. The presentation of material is good and the professors are easy to understand. On the other hand, the lectures didn't always cover everything you needed to know to tackle the homework; if you don't come into this course with any C experience, you'll probably need to do a bit of outside reading to tackle some of the homework. I also found myself getting a bit bored with this course due some long puzzle-like programming assignments and the low-level nature of the course.

As with many self-help books or courses, you may learn a few things and you may end up with several tools for improvement.

The instructor likes to give silly names (e.g., Intentional Change Theory) to simple things that are either common wisdom or ideas that you've seen before. The idea that you'd have to take an in-person "graduate-level course" in order to advance beyond this course is just silly (need a Bachelor's Degree to do self-help?) and makes me think that Case Western Reserve University doesn't belong on Coursera alongside serious institutions.

Definitely requires the Distinction tracks with essays to have heft as an MBA level course.

The lecturer speaks slowly and monotone so play at 1.5x speed. Otherwise he is quite technically clear in exposition and style.

The lectures covered the materials at an inadequate level of detail, such that reading the text was necessary to do truly well on the assessments. This had the effect of really transforming the class into one which was little more than reading the text and then taking an online assessment: it failed to leverage the power of the internet or multimedia environment. I did not take the final because it was, simply put, INSANE. It covered the material in a depth that was only appropriate to those who already had a deep background in mathematical theory and so did not remotely reflect the material of the course. All in all, a great disappointment.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>12699</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Functional Analysis</course_title><school>School:  CentraleSupélec</school><review_data_id>61378</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Mahmoud Fathy</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>0</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/mahmoudfathy</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-12-24</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Sadly I have only known about this course after it has been taken out I would have loved to attend this course, after reading about the course format , I have seen how it really suits what I precisely require in this subject.

Format - Contents: For an introductory course it was quite extense and detailed. The course described all the major paradigms in recommender systems, spiced with plenty of extra material, mostly in the form of interviews with academy and industry experts in the field. Material: The qualtiy of the presentation was fine, the style was rather classic, not funny but professional, definetely plenty of interesting and useful content, but often long and demanding. The complementary material was also interesting (some reviews and other papers). Assessment: One of the most thorough assessment systems I have seen so far in a MOOC, especially for the intense use of peer-to-peer assessment. In general I think both the quizzess and the programming assignments were appropiate. It is possible to pass the course while not taking the programming assignments, although I strongly recommend the programming part of it. Note than any computer language can be used, as far as one is able to implement the required algorithms. Overall: All in all I highly recommend this course, and I strongly recommend taking also the programming track. It is a very demanding course, challenging at some points, but the material is great and with effort there is much to learn from it.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>3336</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Recommender Systems</course_title><school>School:  University of Minnesota</school><review_data_id>4770</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jonas Barnett</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/jonasbarnett</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-01-07</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is by no means an easy course if you want to do more than the concepts stream. But I was glad it wasn't made out to be an easy course with an easy way to certification. The course was run concurrently for UMN students as well so you've got to take into account that this is a university grade course. The video lectures were long as some people have commented but there is simply a lot of material to cover. I didn't find it slow because it is interesting to understand some of the background and the problems that pioneers encountered. I liked the fact that the course was not dumbed-down. I also liked the wide variety of interviews with other experts and practitioners in the field. On balance, I think the course worked well. There were some execution glitches for the peer grading work - we needed more guidance as to the nuances of a poor, mediocre, good and excellent answer but that part should improve if they choose to run the course again. I did the NLP course by Columbia University earlier in the year and in comparison, I think they are equal in terms of learning outcomes and difficulty but with different approaches. With the NLP course, your mark is based on the level of improvement in the NLP models you were building. The recommender system course has a more traditional approach to assessment.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>3336</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Recommender Systems</course_title><school>School:  University of Minnesota</school><review_data_id>4647</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Nikhil sarpotdar</reviewer_name><other_review_count>4</other_review_count><other_course_completed>4</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/nikhilsarpotdar</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-12-23</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>This is a great course. I did not have any background in the material and it was fund to learn a lot of the concepts. If you know basic linear algebra (and little bit of vector math) this class shouldn't be too difficult. Joe Konstan has been in this field for a long time and is well known in the field (a lot of papers reference joe's papers). The workload is on a larger side, which is true for most of the computer science courses as well. A distinction about this MOOC was we were taking it in parallel with university of Minnesota students taking it for credit at their school. As a result the course was setup to be a normal "university level course" together with timed midterms and final exams and a lot of written and programming assignments. Studying for the exams and all the assignments took up a lot of my time (the course itself is not hard to follow/understand) I have the following suggestions for improvements: 1) De-couple lenksit from the assignments. I did all my assignments in R. The DB is fairly small that it can be easily done in R. Also structures dealing with matrices and dot products and vector magnitudes should be done in R (which is optimized for it) than java. If you cannot/do not want to decouple lenskit please add one more week of instructions to go over java concepts and lenskit concepts (which you already do) that will be needed in the course. There is no need to know java. People knowing any programming language can take this course. 2) The course is all encompassing overview of the the field, combining technical aspects together with business considerations. I appreciated that very much. Whats the point of a recommender system that is technically sound but doesn't do a good job of helping a business meet its need ( i.e RMSE is low but lift is low as well). I feel however there was too much static text on the slides. the slides can be made better to have more figures, more movement etc. I appreciate the fact that in some of the videos the professors derived the formula on screen with hand. That made it less mundane. 3) Finally it seemed that the class needs to be freshened up. While we did have a lot of interviews with experts in the field (I particularly like the interview with Netflix and LinkedIn since that is a contemporary use of the recommender system by companies to actually sell their products and make money) it seemed that we were reading papers and learning algorithms that were 10 years old now. Should we be learning something that is more contemporary? Thanks a lot nevertheless. I enjoyed the class a lot and appreciate your efforts (obviously a lot of it) in putting the class together. I learned a lot as well an would recommend it to anyone interested in learning about recommender systems.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>3</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>351</course_id><course_title>Statistics: Making Sense of Data</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>33296</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Syed Badshah</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/ME.PARADOX</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-05-20</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>It was a great introductory course, and both the instructors were just awesome.

Firstly, it's difficult. This is NOT a flaw, but something to note. It's a Stanford graduate level course that, per the instructors, "has not been watered down at all". This results in many people complaining in the discussion forums that the course has grown "legs", and can be quite stressful. Advice to ANYONE taking the course: make sure you have a lot of prior Linear Algebra knowledge. It's much more rigorous than the Linear Algebra used in something like Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course. However, there's also a great book that's published with the course. It's a wonderful reference when you're stuck on something. With that being said, the quizzes are not hard. A lot of the quizzes are normally very short, and do not require much insight into the material. A lot of them are just simple mathematical calculations that are somewhat in the smaller processes of the algorithms in the lectures. On top of this, there's no programming exercises, which are usually helpful for gaining insight on these topics. I think, however, there are a few set of lectures which are extremely difficult to understand. Week 2 is renown on the discussion forums to be the hardest portion of the course, most specifically because Jeffrey Ullman (who is an amazing Computer Scientist!) is a very monotone, rather boring and un-motivational lecturer (he directly reads off a transcript). He doesn't give many examples and his lectures are VERY long (30 minutes at one time), which leaves things rather abstruse. Sometimes, his train of thought can be near impossible to follow. This is where the MMDS book comes in handy. Luckily, Jure and Anand are great lecturers who make things concise, easy, and fun to understand. The content is GREAT. That's definitely an important thing to note. The topics they explore are rather interesting, and relevant. But the course moves very fast. There's a LOT of content to go through, usually two chapters of the MMDS book per week. The lectures can be quite long, and it makes things rather tiring. I think the biggest problem with this course is the lack of structure. I don't know why I'm learning what I'm learning. I don't know how it even fits back into Data Mining as a whole, or what is Data Mining? I don't know how single sets of lectures relate to the next set (it seems as if they do not at all). Weeks jump from one to another without any coherence. Why or when I would I use this in my startup or project? How do these topics relate together? There's no coherence or underlying motif to the course. The videos within the weeks lack coherence too. There are times when material from past lectures are randomly brought back up, and it seems as if random videos introducing new topics that aren't even explained into depth until WEEKS later are inserted at random points in the course. I've been able to retain very little of this course. I find that, each week, I almost certainly forget the intricacies and sometimes even the bigger pictures of the past week. This reflects on the sheer volume of content and the lack of effective structure of the course. MMDS has been mentally stimulating, but definitely needs an overhaul.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>25295</course_id><course_title>Mining Massive Datasets</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>114072</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Kristina Šekrst</reviewer_name><other_review_count>64</other_review_count><other_course_completed>64</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/sekrst</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-10-08</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I loved this course, and I'm recommending it to everyone.

I'm glad to see it had more future runs, it surely deserves it. All the instructors were great, and I loved the way how they explained difficult concepts with various analogies and illustrations. The forum discussions were great, but the course lacks some programming assignments to try to see these approaches in practice, or perhaps to make it a bit longer.

For the two peer review assignments the "rubric" is just a set of guidelines (and this is stated clearly in BOTH pinned threads on peer reviewing; it's actually the first thing stated in both) so all the complainers do have some reason to flood the discussion forums after seeing how some people grade. Though the Course team can't really do anything about it, so it's pretty much a moot point. This isn't to scare people off, in fact the assignments are still fun even though some peers mark too strictly (it's a downfall of p2p, really) and those two assignments are only 20% of the grade (though I could see how a person on the signature track would be annoyed by been graded down if they happened to have a great explanation but were off from the guidelines) I'll probably even take it again, mostly because life got a bit busy so I missed the submission date for the last quiz and peer assignment. I will say that the quizzes were challenging to me, but all the answers are in the videos and it tells you by the quiz which sets of videos will be included (under the Weekly Assignments page, anyway) So, in summary the course is great some of the peers not so much, but that's what happens in courses. I'd still suggest it to anyone interested in Forensics and how all of the science behind it works.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>3613</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Forensic Science</course_title><school>School:  Nanyang Technological University, Singapore</school><review_data_id>52694</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Dennis Horne</reviewer_name><other_review_count>24</other_review_count><other_course_completed>23</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/dennishorne</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-11-28</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>It gives an insight into the science and technology behind CSI/Forensic investigation.

You don't need to know anything about social networks ahead of time to take this course, but having basic familiarity with networks will help things go a bit smoother. The course has 7 weeks of lecture content covering network basics, measures of centrality, network formation models and diffusion, learning and games on networks. You'll also be introduced to Gephi, a software tool for network visualization and analysis. The 8th week is reserved for a final exam. Social and economic networks provides all the raw information you need to get a solid grounding in network theory and analysis, but the presentation style is impersonal so the content is not particularly engaging. The professor is knowledgeable and appears on screen while explaining lecture slides, but he shows little emotion. While the lectures can get a bit intimidating with equation after equation, the homework exercises and final exam are easier than the lectures might suggest. You get 2 attempts on each chapter quiz and 1 attempt on the final; a score of 70% or more is required for a certificate and 90% or more will earn you a certificate with distinction. All in all, social and economic networks is worthwhile course if you are interested in social networks and aren't intimidated by a bit of math, but I wouldn't take it for fun. If you want to take a course on the same subject that is less mathy consider Coursera's Networked Life from UPenn.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>365</course_id><course_title>Social and Economic Networks:  Models and Analysis</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>59874</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Richard Taylor</reviewer_name><other_review_count>29</other_review_count><other_course_completed>28</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/richardtaylor</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-11-18</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>This is a very nice intermediate/advanced course on Social Networks.

I signed up for it as a trial run, to see what online classes were like, before starting courses I really wanted to take just after this one was due to end. The description accurately informed me of the level of difficulty (Hard) but, with my background as a high-tech physicist/chemist and recent coursework in biology and physiology, I figured I could muddle along well enough to test the online learning environment. This course was amazing! I was very relieved to hear the professor begin Week 3 with, "If you survived the first two weeks, the rest will be" easier. He did a great job of providing the background and vocabulary needed early so that it could sink in for subsequent sessions. I have completed about 8 Coursera classes since taking this first one. This class should be the gold standard for how to run an online course. It was extremely well organized, support materials great, and the staff support and fora stayed professional and were very well run. I think a lot of participants dropped out in the first couple of weeks which probably kept the student interactions more academic than some of the socio-whine-ish directions more accessible classes have gone. The professor was so inspiring, knowledgeable, professional, and engaging in his lectures that I really felt as though I was in an actual classroom. I did complete the class - even earning a certificate - but I will definitely take it again because I enjoyed it so much and think that there is a lot more to learn.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>81</course_id><course_title>Drugs and the Brain</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>945</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jerrit Tan</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/jerrittan</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-02-14</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>great.

The good: The amount and difficulty of material was about right for a first introductory course. The assignments were well thought out and required you to actually engage yourself in parallel programming instead of just watch videos and forget what you saw a few days later. The bad: There were a few snafus in the initial installment of the course with assignment grading (and delays with the grading); however, these should likely go away with future offerings of the course. The video lectures sometimes proceeded forwards in a painstakingly slow pace so using 1.5-2.0 speed up helped.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>113</course_id><course_title>Heterogeneous Parallel Programming</course_title><school>School:  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</school><review_data_id>953</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Alex Ott</reviewer_name><other_review_count>6</other_review_count><other_course_completed>5</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/alexott</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-02-19</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I took this course to refresh my mostly theoretical knowledge of CUDA/OpenCL programming. Course was pretty interesting, starting with basics, and continue to more complex topics. Besides CUDA programming, there were lectures on MPI, OpenCL and some related topics. Lectures were detailed, but professor talked very slow, so 1.50 speed helped a lot. Presence of CUDA capable graphic card on my computer was great help for me, as I was able to debug my programs locally, without using cloud server, as it wasn't working correctly many times. But independent on any problems, this course was very useful for me.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>113</course_id><course_title>Heterogeneous Parallel Programming</course_title><school>School:  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</school><review_data_id>692</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Ruslan Bes</reviewer_name><other_review_count>9</other_review_count><other_course_completed>8</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/ruslanbes</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-06-08</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>I'm writing this brief review in the middle of the course (2nd week). Video Lectures: half of the time you learn CUDA C specific commands and programming constructs. The other half — intro to parallel architecture and its difference from Von Neumann's. Quizzes: Good. Usually they are testing your understanding of the architecture. Just five questions, but some of them require a lot of thinking. Programming Assignments: First three are a little bit boring. 4-th and 5-th are quite interesting. Now why had I rated it so low. The reason is that this course is not very well organized. 1) Currently it has technical issues with programming assignments and grading. 2) The Video Lectures's quality. Here is what I mean: recall your first time doing public presentations or something important on public. Recall how nervous you were and kept forgetting what are you gonna say next. This is exactly the impression I'm getting from Video Lectures. Speed 1.5x helps a little bit. 3) Slides could be made much more interactive. There is no in-lecture quizzes now, which was the most engaging force for me in "Machine Learning" and other courses. It's a shame that technical problems have made so much trouble. The topic is very interesting, it has a lot of applications in real life and the lecturer is surely a pro. I hope the staff will re-record videos and make the next session of this course more stable.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>4</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>3354</course_id><course_title>Linear Circuits</course_title><school>School:  Georgia Institute of Technology</school><review_data_id>4681</review_data_id><reviewer_name>soesilo wijono</reviewer_name><other_review_count>19</other_review_count><other_course_completed>19</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/soesilowijono</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-12-28</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I took this class as a refresher to the same class I learnt when in University, and it has a good materials.

I think the course is very well structured with enough rigor for one to learn but not cause a lot of burden. i.e the load is just right. Each module has a set of exercises and at the end of the module there is a comprehensive quiz that asses the student for the whole module. I can not say there is anything bad about the course.The derivations for some equations were not shown in detail, but I see that as an advantage; do not burden the student with a lot of Calculus.. especially since this is an intro class (and the class is not a Calc class). So the tools are given to solve the problems and the explanations are given in an intuitive way. There is a part 2 to this course (Electronics). Can't wait to sign up for that one. I think it will be a success as long as they stick to the same structure and format. Once you are done with this course you will be more prepared to take the edX course.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>3354</course_id><course_title>Linear Circuits</course_title><school>School:  Georgia Institute of Technology</school><review_data_id>3530</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Bob Gallenberger</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/bobgallenberger</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-10-22</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>A dumbed down intro circuits course.

Here's why: The course supports programming assignments in multiple languages: C, C++, Python, Java. You can implement your algorithms in all 4 languages and learn all of them. They have automatic grader for all 4 languages. Your algorithms need to be optimized to pass the assignments, not just creating output correctly. The grader was designed to test you on 3 criteria: Correct Answer, Time Limit and Memory Limit. This course really forces learners to implement the best algorithms possible, not just a working algorithm. The materials presented are very well-designed. You can tell that tons of efforts have been put into developing the videos, the slides, the assignments. Talking about the assignments, each week there is one problem set that consists of 4 or 5 smaller problems. These problems range from easy (discussed in lectures, you only need to write code) - medium (not hard, but you need to design your own algorithm) - advanced (hard, and you'll need to design your own algorithm. They are not trivial. They are really challenging, and you'll spend a lot of time doing them, especially the advanced problems, but you'll learn a lot of things in the process. About algorithms itself, this course introduces recursion, naive and efficient algorithms in the first lesson. Next, it teaches greedy algorithms, divide-and-conquer and last but not least: dynamic programming. For each topic, there is one problem set consisting of 4-5 problems ranging from easy to advanced. The discussion forums are so lively with people constantly discussing correct solutions, different approaches to the problem, algorithms efficiency, even differences between languages! I have learnt so much from the forum, note that it is just the first week. The instructors are very active in the forum. You'll get to learn from many instructors in this course. The drawback of this course is that it has pay-access (you will not be able to submit assignments without payment, however you can view them). However, I think it is very justifiable. It is very easy to tell that tons of effort, money, time and expertise have been put into making this course possible and it is well-worth the price tag.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>51759</course_id><course_title>Algorithmic Toolbox</course_title><school>School:  University of California, San Diego</school><review_data_id>118853</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-02-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course presentation is excellent.

And it did that. Sort of. Just not in the "Introduction to Nanotechnology" way I was hoping for. These facts and concepts were strewn about throughout the four weeks that covered Nanotechnology, Nanoelectronics, Nanomagnetics and Nanophotonics, respectively. There were a few things that they did right. First, the course offered the basic Statement of Accomplishment and a Statement of Accomplishment with Distinction for those who watched additional lectures and took additional, math intensive quizzes. They aren't lying when they say you need some knowledge of chemistry and physics. If you took those courses long ago, you need to brush up to get the most out of this course. The course clearly isn't geared towards anybody with just a passing interest in nanotechnology but is obviously for students who already have a strong background in the sciences. The weekly lectures weren't easy to slog through. If you're one who loses focus when somebody is talking about exponents for 10 straight minutes, you might have a difficult time getting through the six to eight required 15 minute long lectures. This material should have probably been stretched out to six weeks instead of four, as some very elaborate material was shoehorned in to a series of slides that were quickly glossed over. The quizzes were more difficult than I was expecting, which is actually a nice change of pace for Coursera courses. You can take them up to 4 times, but the questions change between quizzes so you actually have to know your stuff rather than getting a better grade simply by eliminating incorrect responses. This was my fifth MOOC, and it was easily the course with the lowest production values I've yet to see. The lectures were just Power Point slides with a small webcam of the lecturers talking at the student. The video editing was sub-par, with in-video lecture questions often popping up mid- sentence. The volume was all over the place; one video too low but the next way too loud. There's a difference between simply putting a course online and creating a MOOC. The bad production values, the fact that interaction with other students was never discussed and the general lack of thought into the way the course was presented makes me think that Rice simply tweaked an existing online course without realizing that the bar has been set much higher.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>91</course_id><course_title>Nanotechnology: The Basics</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>4536</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Ajao Ridwan</reviewer_name><other_review_count>2</other_review_count><other_course_completed>2</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/ajaoridwan</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-12-14</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>it was great to have these subjects reminded with such a perfect instructor.

All videos are provided in lecture-style with the professor and a few of his staff talking.  Transcripts are provided but as this is a course by an Italian university, the strong accent and lack of cultural awareness (in terms of teaching, interaction between course staff and engagement with the students) reduce the value of those features. The course suffered from a number of hick ups such as unclear instructions in quizzes, general errors which seemed to be down to inconsistencies or lack of careful checks prior to release of quizzes or hints, a marking scheme that was changed after a number of student complaints and in general a shorter period to submit work than other coursera courses.  Student frustration was expressed in forum discussions but staff generally responded selectively, the lack of awareness that reliable marking criteria and engaged teaching are vital to student satisfaction was apparent and did not change over the duration of the course. Overall, the course provides valuable insights, not least due to the number of skilled and experienced professionals who engage in forum discussions - which provided a great opportunity for networking.  The staff seemed to rely on that feature though rather than providing deeper insights themselves.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>12647</course_id><course_title>Financing and Investing in Infrastructure</course_title><school>School:  Università Bocconi</school><review_data_id>36729</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Kaushik Rajan</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/kaushikrajan</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-03-08</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I have some experience in the area of Project Finance and so personally find the course difficulty level to be fairly easy.

The activity model of doing problems as you go rather than sitting though a lecture is an excellent paradigm, but could be improved by having more video lectures added. Its not just watching someone derive this stuff, its knowing how the material is discussed in human language and not just as symbols. The class was a living breathing thing as the class materials were all on github so that students could propose edits of the course pages to help correct mistakes and offer extended material as the course progressed the quality of the previous weeks were improved by this process.

With a few engineering multivariable courses already available online (for instance, Denis Aurox's brilliant 18.02 course at MIT OCW), it's really nice to see one that treats the derivative as a linear map, matrices as representations of linear transforms, kth derivatives of real valued maps as k-linear forms, and so on. It's not a complete introduction to linear algebra by any means, but gives you enough to really understand differentiation while giving some tools that should help towards constructing a theory of integration in Rn in the upcoming follow-up course. There is a lot of material in this course and you are asked (but not required for credit) to prove lots of the theorems, so you can get a very good intro to the subject. Not quite Calculus on Manifolds level since occasionally a critical result will just be quoted (e.g., the implicit function theorem), but it's still a pretty well-developed theoretic treatment of multivariable differential calculus. I really would like to see the implicit function theorem added, as well as a discussion of finite dimension inner product spaces if/when this course is offered again, as I needed both to prove the result on Lagrange multipliers. With that said, some people will be put off by the focus on solving problems as you read the material; there is almost nothing in the way of videos. The course is more like going through a really well-written workbook. I really hope Jim adds some more video in future iterations, because sometimes it really helps to have an expert derive a difficult result or execute a difficult computation in front of you. But the learning activities that form the real meat of the course are outstanding. There are theoretic problems, computational problems, and it's a great way to learn by doing instead of by watching. I fully agree with Jim and Steven that this is much a better format than the typical 1-3 hours of weekly video you usually see on coursera, though I think some video on the hairier parts would still be pretty helpful. You can tell this course is a ton of work for Jim and Steven. It's a bit rough around the edges with bugs in the activities in this first run, but those should be mostly ironed out by the second offering, since they're corrected pretty quickly here in the first. Another big plus to this course is that Jim and Steven are both very active on the board answering questions. You can tell these guys are enthusiastic about the material, and I'm really excited to see where they go from here with their future offerings. Jim and Steven both sound like kids in the candy store when they talk about future courses they'd like to offer. I hope they can do them in this style. Overall, even with some of the omissions I pointed out above, the material is really incredible and the problem solving approach to me really helps to make the difficult topics like multilinear forms fall in place. YMMV, but the material presented in this format taught me a lot.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>4</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16068</course_id><course_title>Massively Multivariable Open Online Calculus Course</course_title><school>School:  The Ohio State University</school><review_data_id>29877</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Charles McCall</reviewer_name><other_review_count>3</other_review_count><other_course_completed>3</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/charlesmccall</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-04-26</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>The course was my first exposure to multivariable calculus and I have nothing to compare it to. So consider this the perspective of a multivariable newbie. Cons: 1) Buggy launch, but all that should be fixed the second time around. 2) Not enough. Not enough exploration of the implications of the material presented; not enough examples; not enough problems to solve. I finished feeling that my grasp of the material would be ephemeral and easily forgotten. Pros: 1) Minimal time spent passively watching videos, I like to interact ; ). 2) Wonderful, wonderful staff! They seem to genuinely want each and every student to understand and to pass. They were constantly on the forums answering questions. I only wish they had more help. 3) Python. Each section has optional assignments on Python programs applied to the math. This part of the course was minimally stressed but it was there for those who wanted to pursue it. It certainly adds to the richness of the course. Overall, it was an excellent course which, at my level, I found quite challenging.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>2</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>226</course_id><course_title>English Common Law: Structure and Principles</course_title><school>School:  University of London</school><review_data_id>60826</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Mostafa Kamal</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>0</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/mostafakamal</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-11-21</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>puplic international law , administrative law , criminal law</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>226</course_id><course_title>English Common Law: Structure and Principles</course_title><school>School:  University of London</school><review_data_id>53374</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Cloud Strife</reviewer_name><other_review_count>22</other_review_count><other_course_completed>20</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/Q</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-09-02</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review/><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>226</course_id><course_title>English Common Law: Structure and Principles</course_title><school>School:  University of London</school><review_data_id>42686</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jack Rogers</reviewer_name><other_review_count>15</other_review_count><other_course_completed>8</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/jackrogers</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-07-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course crams 10 weeks of reading into just 5 weeks, so be prepared to work.

What I did not expect was to put through an amazing, challenging and tremendously exciting learning curve, reading and deciphering scientific papers and being forced to critically examine the concepts and processes by which Nobel Prize winners made their discoveries. Another reviewer has expressed annoyance at the course not being basic. In fact we were given the choice of two tracks - a basic and a scholar's track. I'm sure I recall that the course particulars stated clearly that it would not be an easy course/ EDEX Biology 700X is a different kettle of fish altogether (wonderful kettle!) and comparisons between the two courses need to take into account their aims and objectives. I frankly would have found 700X much harder going without Prep for Intro Biology. In my first year at university, I have not only managed to keep up with fellow students who are coming fresh from high school biology and chemistry studies, but I have also managed good grades.

This was more of a "here are the facts" course than a course where the instructor tries to get students excited about the subject. I was a little frustrated with some of the peer-assessed writing assignments. In some cases, the questions were worded in a general way, but the sample answers expected certain specific information. So sometimes an answer was wrong simply because the student didn't read the instructor's mind. This problem improved somewhat in the later assignments. I thought the module on the parts of the cell was especially good.

Having an A-level (which is a UK higher education qualification) in chemistry and a degree in physics, I thought that this course would be an ideal first step. However, I found that it rushed through concepts far too quickly to cement any solid understanding and the lecturer just bombarded you with new terms with little or no explanation. It reminded me a lot of those professors at university who just threw buckets of facts at you, expecting them to stick. The lecturer explains at the beginning of the course that it has been designed to get students who will be attending UC Irvine up to speed before starting their lectures. As such, perhaps it would be better hosted on the UC Irvine website rather than promoted as a MOOC. At the very least it needs to be made clear that this is not an entry level course.

The idea is to present economics assuming you know calculus. That makes sense, because many of us learn calculus these days at the age of 14 or 15. And yet every other economics class avoids calculus, offering hand-waving explanations instead of mathematical rigor. The only problem is that the professor doesn't spell out the math carefully, thus defeating the purpose. If any instructors for this class are reading this: please, please write a mathematical treatment booklet similar to the "Essentials of Game Theory" booklet required for the Stanford Game Theory class.

It even gives a good idea of what the advanced methods are based on, but can't necessarily go in too much depth as the class seems targeted to introductory level and because it would require much more time. I wish there was a MOOC that focused on these more advancied topics like PDEs for image processing or compressed sensing! Overall this class is a good overview of image processing and applications, recommended!</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>72</course_id><course_title>Aboriginal Worldviews and Education</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>33959</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Edward Bobinchak</reviewer_name><other_review_count>4</other_review_count><other_course_completed>4</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/edwardbobinchak</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-05-30</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Jean-Paul gives a great introduction to Aboriginal culture. This course does not just present facts, but helps students reflect on how Aboriginal thinking differs from Euro-classical thinking--and often is much more healthy and respectful of our environment.

Exceeded expectations, didn't really know what to expect for material. The professor is very knowledgable and did a great job of organizing the material and presenting in a logical way. Covers a variety of aspects and topics so always fresh; supplemental materials, readings and videos: pertinent and useful. The only drawback is that some of the student population several times expressed in the forums an ethno-centric world view and with comments about "you can't understand because you're not Canadian" or "McDonald's is a Canadian institution" (?!), nitpicking on spelling/phrasing to non-native speakers, commentary about aboriginal alcohol compsumption, etc. Ironically this and other viewpoints highlighted the points of the class about closed-mindedness. But the superiority attitude was only in the student population, not the course overall. Highly recommend, but use caution in the forums.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>72</course_id><course_title>Aboriginal Worldviews and Education</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>1296</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Matt Pierce</reviewer_name><other_review_count>8</other_review_count><other_course_completed>8</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/mattpierce</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-07-17</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I took this class hoping to expand my philosophical horizons with some new perspectives on Indigenous thought and philosophy. There was a good degree of what I was looking for (mostly in relation to Aboriginal ideas about knowledge, knowing, and education - which wa fascinating), but this course actually is more designed to speak to the social issues regarding First Nations (particularly those in Canada) including education, economics, and governance. It was still quite interesting, however, and the instructor provided an abundance of out-of-class resources in the form of videos and reading.

So I had many reasons for learning more about what some people may label this as ADHD. This course is pretty straightforward. The grade is entirely based on multiple choice questions. The questions aren't too difficult and you get 3 tries on a quiz. However, there are no dropped quizzes or late days allowed and you have to get at least 90% to get a certificate. Because of this and that I was overworked at the time with other matters, I decided to unofficially drop the course, but since it was unofficial I still have access to the class and I am currently enjoying reviewing all the materials. Stay tuned as I update this review with the results of that rereview. Another reason I took this course is that the Univ of Pennsylvania has one the best medical schools and psychology departments in the world. So I don't worry that I'm learning from someone not uninformed (important for a potentially controversial topic like this). Unlike nearly every other MOOC, the professor creates a single video per week. He talks deliberately (i.e. not quickly) so you probably want to use one of the speedup settings. The professor's delivery style is fine, but for those of us who shift attention more rapidly than the average person, it would be better if he was more exciting or broke up his lectures into smaller chunks. We don't just pay attention just because the course title orders us to "Pay Attention!" ;-) I didn't have time to finish the course during its regular schedule, but I continue to view videos and read materials from the course. I hope they offer it again so I can interact live with others in the class.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>328</course_id><course_title>"Pay Attention!!"

You can learn all that you may want to find out about this condition, and gain access to many sources of information. If you have personal reasons to be interested in ADHD, and no working knowledge in medicine or psychology it is particularly worthwhile. The course is not very demanding so you can invest the time needed. The lectures are short in most of the cases, but the reading material will help you cover the subject area in greater depth.

If you're a beginner, you will learn all that you may want to find out about this condition. If you have someone near you with ADHD, it is particularly worthwhile. My only beef with this course is that it's very superficial. Sure, that may be the objective - but for someone like me who was looking to go in detail into the neuroanatomy of ADHD, it wasn't enough. A symptom of that is the fact that lectures are too short (30-minute lectures) and the quizzes too easy.

Seeing other's people work can be inspiring. You get some templates and libraries (audio, physics, gui...). Bad: You are provided with some software templates and libraries and very brief information how to use them in the videos (not very well produced), but that's it, you're mostly on your own so there is not much added value compared to self-study. The professors just don't care, almost none of the student's concerns are directly addressed. Setting up Processing to work with mobile device can be extemely difficult (expecially if you have more obscure brand of phone/tablet), in the end only a tiny minority of students made apps specifically for mobile devices. The staff pushes javascript versions of the apps, but they tend to have suboptimal performance, work only in some browsers and sometimes not at all and there is almost no help from staff. The grading rubric for projects is terrible- there are only 3 levels (bad = 0 points, good = 5 points, great = 10 points) with only vague information what each level means, there is no telling how important the different aspects (creativity, code quallity etc...) are or how strict you should be. You are graded by 5 people so your score is based a lot by chance. There is no way of telling how the grade is calculated (you don't see what individual scores you get). If the graders don't provide comments, there si no useful feedback for you. There are too many topics and too little time, so it's difficult to focus on one topic and it's more difficult to base project on templates introduced later in course because you have less time to get familiar with them. The result is that lot of the projects you grade are unfinished works-in-progress, sometimes just basic torsos of the apps. The course si focused a lot on musical apps, so if you find them boring/not interesting then you will have not much fun. Another bad thing is that Processing is not really suitable to work with audio, especially with the javascript version. All in all, it just feels like a bad very trimmed trial version of their standard university courses.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>212</course_id><course_title>Creative Programming for Digital Media &amp; Mobile Apps</course_title><school>School:  University of London</school><review_data_id>2590</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Cristina</reviewer_name><other_review_count>5</other_review_count><other_course_completed>5</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/cristina</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-06-22</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>so far it looks a lot of fun in the hands of young teachers. the programming portion of it is really easy to follow.

Reading material was well thought out and a nice supplement to the course. The funniest activity, at least for me, was Global Literacy Test where you could check and recheck how familiar you are with things going on around the Globe.

"Calvin - Histoire et Réception d'une Réforme" (Université de Genève) was provided by theologists of a European university who I thought were rigorous and serious. Disappointing! Although they say that "the approach we develop is critical: we intend neither to canonize nor to condemn Calvin or his thought. Our goal, rather, is to avoid any rash evaluation in order to understand his thought and analyze the issues at stake in it.", what I found was a team of professors highly prone to make a god out of Calvin and absorbed in thinking about themselves and their city (the beautiful Geneva) as the acme of the world. The course aimed to make us know about a man who exerted a substantial influence in Western thought. But the dogmatic theology which poured from the course on Calvin made me thirsty of an anti-dogmatic critical phylosophy (which I encountered in another Coursera course, taught at the same time: "Søren Kierkegaard - Subjectivity, Irony and the Crisis of Modernity", by Professor Jon Stewart, Unversity of Copenhagen).

The reason I did not give this course a 5 star rating is because the grading system was not well explained. Many (including myself) were baffled as to how our percentage grades were arrived at.

The readings were appropriate and supported the course work. It was a good class that explored elements of US Civil War history that are often not covered in basic US History survey courses. I am pretty familiar with the war, but most of my reading has been focused either on Lincoln or battles, so the larger perspective of how slavery impacted the country (and the lives of the slaves themselves) was a worthwhile new perspective. I found the least satisfying part of the class to be the essays and evaluations. I thought the essay topics were pretty lightweight and mostly designed to make sure students read the work. Most frustrating (for me) were the peer reviews. Each week you had to review the work of 4 other students, answering 3 questions about their work, and your review was required to be a minimum of 150 words per essay. That's a lot of writing, and some students only turned in a few words or were blowing off a class, but you were still stuck writing a "review." Also, given the open nature of the MOOC, the quality of the reviews you receive on your own work is VERY mixed (and there were endless discussion board postings complaining about the reviews). But if you're interested in the topic, it's worth signing up for the lectures and to dabble in the essays (particularly if you're not concerned over getting a certificate). I'd like to see the professor take a more adventurous approach to the lectures, because although they DO incorporate good information, it's entirely the single professor staring into a camera and lecturing. (In contrast, Al Fireis of ModPo provides group discussions with students, live webinars, etc. and really pushes the online medium further). Overall, a good first effort on the professor's part.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>415</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Power Electronics</course_title><school>School:  University of Colorado Boulder</school><review_data_id>4657</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Norm</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/norm</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-12-24</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I have a 4-year degree in Electronics. I had no prior exposure to power electronics before taking this course. First couple of weeks start off with getting familiar with ideal schematics of the most common SMPS. A week is then given to realizing the switches these SMPS use with common semiconductor devices such as diodes and MOSFETs. This topic is summarized as "need to know this exists". It deserves probably a course of its own. Then you move on to a bit more advanced SMPS topologies. You learn to integrate transformers into your circuit analyses. You then switch over to AC analysis because life is not ideal. The last portion of the course is on control loops and deriving the transfer functions to make sense of it mathematically. Overall, it is a great course. I believe it is a must-have for every EE out there. I marked it as Medium because eventhough the content is really hard to digest and requires hours of dedicated work, the exams have practically infinite tries and that helps you pass it.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>415</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Power Electronics</course_title><school>School:  University of Colorado Boulder</school><review_data_id>3900</review_data_id><reviewer_name>lsla</reviewer_name><other_review_count>3</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/lsla</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is one of the best courses I have taken.

The course "The Social Context of Mental Health and Illness?" answers these and other questions concerning the changing ideas and views about mental illnesses and treatments throughout the last two centuries. The course instructor - Charmaine Williams from the University of Toronto - is a seasoned mental health care professional herself. She manages to spice up the rather theoretical course with many real-life examples as well as a videographed visit to the grounds of a defunct mental asylum in Toronto, Canada.

Great topics. I learned a lot. The peer assignments tied in very nice to the course, No quizzes were required, Only peer reviews and I am not a big fan of those at all, but with this class it was pretty easy to do. She does a great job on the forums helping out, She also does lectures to give tips and explains the assignments and what she expects in them and how to grade them. I have problem when it comes to peer reviews, you could have someone grading a paper that has less knowledge on the material than the person they are grading or the other way around. A student might be grading a paper of someone who has better language skills than the person grading it and if it's the other way around you can get people who down grade a paper because of poor grammar etc, the point is that in a peer review journal you are being reviewed by peers who have the same understanding and knowledge or close to the same knowledge as the person they are reviewing and I don't think that is possible in an online class. We are students not teachers and therefore some of use have more or less knowledge than each other on these subjects. You could also have people who would graded down a paper because of racism or hatred for another culture.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>2</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>244</course_id><course_title>The Law of the European Union: An Introduction</course_title><school>School:  Universiteit Leiden</school><review_data_id>71238</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Alec Rogers</reviewer_name><other_review_count>2</other_review_count><other_course_completed>2</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/alecrogers</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-02-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This was one of the best MOOCs I've experienced.

Unfortunately, the course wasn't a true introduction as I apparantly needed. The lectures covered vast and detailed topics quickly and all at once; many of the terms and concepts were briefly mentioned and I wasn't able to apply when they were later referenced. As a suggestion, I would recommend breaking some of the early lectures down by topic and going over them more extensively, with examples. Maybe more charts, summaries or real-world application would have helped.

I salute the way the cosmological concepts of dark matter and dark energy were explained easily by a trained physicist, and the way the discussion forums were moderated by competent staff members.

They are introductory but go into some detail. I learned a lot, and I had prior exposure to this topic. If you're interested in this topic, I couldn't recommend this course more. There's nothing negative to say, maybe apart from the fact that the evaluation was a little too simple.

Making readings required before watching a video is kind of old-school too. There are NO CERTIFICATES offered for this course (unless you want to enroll in a full university course with the usual large fees). The main professor is very esteemed in his field, but he has no clue how to operate a computer. He CONSTANTLY flips to the wrong slide, back and forth and this gets quite annoying after you've seen him do this for the 100th time. Since a large portion of the syllabus is not of importance to me (I'm just interested in forecasting) and there is no certificate, I have no plans to take any tests. I also won't do any activities I don't find HIGHLY useful. I guess that counts as dropped. Given the alternative sources for this info (including one from MIT), I don't think I will be completing this course.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>12696</course_id><course_title>Climate Change in Four Dimensions</course_title><school>School:  University of California, San Diego</school><review_data_id>7155</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Ray Sutton</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/raysutton</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-03-03</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I thought the UCSD on-ine course was excellent, covering all aspects of the topic of climate change, from it's history, modelling, impacts, legal aspects and international agreements, and discussions on scientific concensus and disagreement.

Having said that the discussion forums(shoutout to the community TA's) are really helpful and one can find their way through a problem sooner or later.This course as the name suggests really makes you think deeply whether it is understanding the problem or writing code.You cant write inefficient code and get away with it ,since you'll be working on large data sets. It's not just the course material you learn on the way but also learn helpful techniques(such as making plots, calculating running times and so forth.)So to solve a problem you'll have to learn additional things which makes the learning experience all the more challenging and exciting.All in all this course is a great introduction to working with algorithms as it makes you analyze ,write efficient implementations and solve real world problems using the learned algorithms.Once again a great job done by the Professors and the entire team at Rice.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>42456</course_id><course_title>Algorithmic Thinking (Part 1)</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>114971</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Hamideh Iraj</reviewer_name><other_review_count>65</other_review_count><other_course_completed>55</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/hamidehiraj</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-10-31</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I audited this course as a beginner in algorithms.

After week 4, the exercises in part B got hard and demanded more time to complete than I could spare.

I have had the opportunity to participate in this course twice - once as a student and once as a Coursera TA - and can only highly recommend it to anyone who wants to gain a better understanding of why some community health interventions fail while others produce salient results.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>75</course_id><course_title>Community Change in Public Health</course_title><school>School:  Johns Hopkins University</school><review_data_id>2766</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Andrea</reviewer_name><other_review_count>6</other_review_count><other_course_completed>5</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/andrea</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-07-16</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>This class was pretty easy but the thought came in completing the peer assessments about foreign communities and problems. It was enlightening to realize how small the step must be within communities to resolve problems we might recognize on a global scale. It gave me a new appreciation for the absolute respect for others, the coaching and diplomacy, that is required to do the most important jobs - like ridding a country of malaria - person by person!

I think that it would be better if the quizzes had 10 questions because it would cover the content better. 2)The course organization was a little bit messy. They changed some key dates, such as assessment opening and that messed up things... 3)Peer Assessment was worth 50% of the grade. Even if I ended up with 19/20 I know some people who had issues with this and even failed this course because of that. I believe in peer grading and I think it's great, as an extra resource. To rely 50% of the grade in that is quite risky. Apart of this problems the course was really good. Lots of real examples and relevant information. I liked a lot the fact that they didn't only teach us the theory but also shown all the equipment used for neuromarketing studies. The eye tracking equipment was very interesting.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>12666</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Consumer Neuroscience &amp; Neuromarketing </course_title><school>School:  Copenhagen Business School</school><review_data_id>68117</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jorim Holtey-Weber</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>0</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/JorimHoltey-Weber</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-01-13</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>excellent course! the instructors give an effort to explain in simple terms so that people not familiar to the area can grasp the concepts.

In just five weeks, it gives you an overview on current migratory fluxes into the US, the evolution of policies and laws, current requirements and even likely future changes. To do this, you will discuss the US Constitutional law, racism and even the political structure of the country. As the professor repeats over and over, this course will not give you enough information in case you're trying to get into the US. But it certainly goes a long way for an introductory course. There are quizzes, an exam and a (very simple) written assignment, The lectures are really good, at just the correct pace. The only drawback is an unavoidable one, which is the scope of the course itself. If you don't really care about something as specific as US immigration, you should absolutely not take this course. But I guess you could say this about the scope of any other course.

Topics covered include Fourier analysis, sinusoidal decomposition of music, harmonic and stochastic representations, sound transformations, and extraction of audio features from music for purposes of classification and retrieval. The course emphasizes not only programming various signal-processing functions in Python, but also the use of very versatile and just plain cool applications such as Audacity, Sonic Visualizer, a variety of spectral modeling synthesis tools, and Essentia. The programming and most applications require a Linux environment, but the course staff has heroically assembled a downloadable image that can be launched in Virtual Box (which is free), and which has all applications pre-loaded and ready to go. Each week, Prof. Serra presents lectures in three formats: a theoretical overview of the mathematical and physical principles, “demo” lectures that illustrate operation of the various tools and applications, and programming lectures that introduce the code underlying resources you’ll use that week as well as useful background for the programming tasks. The theory lectures are excellent, compressing a lot of technical detail into accessible, understandable nuggets. The demo and programming lectures, which are more free-form, are useful but sometimes ramble a bit. In terms of grading, the first six weeks feature computer-graded programming assignments; weeks 7 through 10 have peer-reviewed assignments that involve analysis and manipulation of music clips. There is also a weekly quiz. And now, some cautionary notes. First, there’s quite a bit of (interesting!) math and, particularly as the course progresses, some real Python programming challenges. Familiarity with the fine points of Python array operations is essential. Second, there were problems related to grading. For code submissions, the auto-graders were very fussy: you thought your function returned true or false, but the grader expected a default boolean and unbeknownst to you, your function returned a NumPy boolean and was marked wrong; or you returned an array in the right format, but unbeknowst to you, the grader expected 64-bit ints and yours were 32 bits. The weekly quizzes varied in difficulty but often had at least one question whose “correct” answer was ambiguous or seemed to contradict the lectures. And while some of the topics such as the discrete and short-time Fourier transforms have obvious and widespread importance, you may be forgiven for asking yourself, when all is said and done, how relevant a lot of what you’ve learned is to the experience, understanding, or organization of music outside some very specialized contexts. Still, learning to unpack a flute solo into its harmonic and breathy components, or to gain insight from spectrograms that at first look like a Jackson Pollack viewed through a screen door, is quite rewarding -- and playing with sounds is just fun. If you’re ready to make the commitment and can tolerate a few frustrations, you’ll get a lot out of this course.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26582</course_id><course_title>Audio Signal Processing for Music Applications</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>116091</review_data_id><reviewer_name/><other_review_count>3</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/knfuchss</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-11-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Great course, great content, great explanations, meaningful and challenging exercises.

It was a terrific introduction to issues of animal welfare, placing the subject into context using research into animal cognition and behaviour. It also offered some indications of what different countries are doing about improving animal welfare. By tying all of these elements together, the course offered a solid foundation for further study of the subject.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>12659</course_id><course_title>Animal Behaviour and Welfare</course_title><school>School:  The University of Edinburgh</school><review_data_id>50687</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Ricardo Teixeira</reviewer_name><other_review_count>86</other_review_count><other_course_completed>77</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/ricardoteixeira</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-08-15</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>I was very skeptical when I enrolled in this course. I thought it might end up being a bleeding-heart environmentalist course, accusing people of being murderers if they ate meat or enslaving animals if they owned pets. I was very glad to learn that my intuition couldn't be more wrong. This is a balanced, interesting, and above all else scientific course about animal welfare that shed light on our relations with the animals under our keep - pets, farm animals, or even zoo animals. The most important take-away in my view is that caring for animal welfare means providing animals with the space and conditions they need to display their normal behavior - apart from some basic essentials like food, shelter and humane treatment. There is no eco-fascism and you won't find environmentalist pseudo-moralist views here. Make no mistake about it, the lectures are scientific in nature. Yet they are engaging and will be extremely interesting for anyone interested in these matters. If the course was a bit longer, it would definitely be worth 5 starts. 5 weeks is a bit short considering the breadth of materials in the lectures. Still, it's highly recommended!</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>51426</course_id><course_title>Statistical Inference</course_title><school>School:  Johns Hopkins University</school><review_data_id>120013</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Nirav Desai</reviewer_name><other_review_count>9</other_review_count><other_course_completed>9</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/nirav2</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-04-02</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This was a very useful course in Statistical Inference where in all the fundamentals are taught in a very clear manner, setting the stage for the subsequent course on regression models.

It provides a nice overview of the institutions, ideas and actors that indeed shape the World, as well as the different ways we have to assess and measure how the World is actually configured. It is a relatively light course, and that is also my biggest criticism. Short lectures each week without much depth. I know it's an introduction, but more detail would certainly be desirable. There is a lot of time spent on, for example, the real impact of foreign aid, but then the lecture on NGOs is only 10 minutes long. Of course, the course is so far-reaching that if we used this standard it would take 20 weeks and many hours per week to be fully satisfied. You also get two tracks - one basic and one advanced - depending on how much work you wish to put into the course. That's a nice way to attribute distinction marks to students. The quizzes, though, are extremely simple. Overall a nice experience, much recommended.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>51403</course_id><course_title>Regression Models</course_title><school>School:  Johns Hopkins University</school><review_data_id>120561</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Atheer Al Attar</reviewer_name><other_review_count>2</other_review_count><other_course_completed>2</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/atheer2</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-04-21</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>The main issues of this course its fast pace. Prof. Caffo tone of speech and style of lecture delivery is kind of fast and stuffed with information thus you need to stop several times more than you do in other courses for this specialization [ i.e. comparing with Dr. Peng]. Although I have taken statistical analysis in my post. grad I needed to go back and review several topics. The course companion book provided was not the best option for me [I had to refer to some Youtube videos and used the book of Introduction to Statistics and Probability by Mendhell]. I would say that swirl were a good helper after I finished the lectures. The Course project level was not on the same level with the given material to some extent although I managed to solve all the requirements. One good take of this course is I have done good amount of ggplot plots and started to understand how this great package works. Overall, if you are planning to take this course keep in mind that you will need extra working hours comparing with other courses to finish it in a good shape and DONT forget to create a good notebook because you will need every single word, don't count on your short term memory.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>51403</course_id><course_title>Regression Models</course_title><school>School:  Johns Hopkins University</school><review_data_id>120016</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Nirav Desai</reviewer_name><other_review_count>9</other_review_count><other_course_completed>9</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/nirav2</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-04-02</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course on Regression Models helps develop statistical models for analyzing data sets.

The first track is for artists and those who wish to gain a general knowledge of symmetry and how it is used. The second track is for those that wish to go further to learn the applications of symmetry in crystallography and atomic bonding. I am a graphic artist so the first track was of interest to me. This is a excellent course but was rather advanced for me. There is also a lot to take in during the first four weeks including point symmetry, asymmetric tiling and chirality, 2D and 3D symmetry operations and the 17 plane groups. Most of the descriptions of these concepts use equations. There is a fairly large amount of reference content, and some of it had legibility issues during the time that I took this course. Using discussion forums, I was able to locate better copies. I think this was the second time this course was offered as a MOOC so there are still some things being improved. Overall, the first track of the course was excellent and I feel that I've learned a lot. It is quite difficult and I could see how other student were struggling during the peer reviews. It would be great to offer the first track alone as an eight week course to make the learning more manageable. I plan to view the rest of the video lectures because now I am fascinated with how symmetry works and want to learn how it applies on an atomic level.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>1195</course_id><course_title>El ABC del emprendimiento esbelto </course_title><school>School:  Tecnológico de Monterrey</school><review_data_id>3397</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jaime Alvarez</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/jaimeealvarez</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-10-15</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Es un curso introductorio en el que de forma general, se abordan los aspectos que deben tenerse en cuenta al momento de iniciar un negocio y así minimizar la posibilidad de fracaso, ofrece consejos y prácticas útiles que en ocasiones se oponen a lo que plantea la teoría mas comúnmente aceptada acerca de este tema.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26563</course_id><course_title>Advertising and Society</course_title><school>School:  Duke University</school><review_data_id>61170</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Ricardo Teixeira</reviewer_name><other_review_count>86</other_review_count><other_course_completed>77</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/ricardoteixeira</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-12-09</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Great course on the basics behind the analysis of the sociological dimensions of advertising. The course is extremely interesting in case you're interested in this area. It clears up - or at minimum complexifies - issues taken as dogma regarding the advertisements world. It is simplistic to believe in evil manipulative advertisers that bombard us with subliminal messages constantly, who are sexist and bigoted and create needs that force us to buy things we don't need with money we don't have. That's a nice little litany, but the truth is far more nuanced. This course presents you with many layers of interpretation in a very colorful way. The evaluation is trivially simple, and the course seems a bit short - there was definitely an opportunity to extend and go more in-depth.

The fact that this was a Johns Hopkins course made it doubly attractive for me since JHU is doing a lot of great work in the areas of safety sciences. This course is probably best for someone who has NO idea of the concepts and philosophies behind the sciences of safety in hospitals. The ideas presented are derived from real life implementations so they have a practical ring to them. The course on the whole was easy but the quiz was not straight forward which I liked, simply because it made me refer to the notes once more and completely grasp the ideas. The peer assessments were also mildly challenging and I had fun finishing them. They were not a walk in the park which meant I needed to think hard about what I wanted to talk about. At 5 weeks, this course is one week too long. In a regular academic setting, this would probably be a day long seminar. Even though I did not learn much from the course, it is still a good course and the presenters are people who live 'safety' every day of their work.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>136</course_id><course_title>Web Intelligence and Big Data</course_title><school>School:  Indian Institute of Technology Delhi</school><review_data_id>61374</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Arash Pourhabibi-Zarandi</reviewer_name><other_review_count>5</other_review_count><other_course_completed>5</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/arashpourhabibizarandi</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-12-24</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review/><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>136</course_id><course_title>Web Intelligence and Big Data</course_title><school>School:  Indian Institute of Technology Delhi</school><review_data_id>29004</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Hamideh Iraj</reviewer_name><other_review_count>65</other_review_count><other_course_completed>55</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/hamidehiraj</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-04-14</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>I dropped the course because it was too long and had no concentration.

A little disappointed as had previous courses with Coursera and were excellent, but this one to me sound like a complete waste of time and money.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>98</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Data Science</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>118372</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-02-10</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This feels like taking a live class without the ability to ask questions during the lecture.

However, I did enjoy it quite a lot. It was a nice blend of theoretical models and practice, but it should say that it requires previous experience in Python and SQL, otherwise it could be tough for a beginner. The Tableau visualization was fun, but other assignments could be improved by adding tutorials and more time to grasp these concepts. Kaggle competition was a huge deal, and it should stay mandatory. I'd recommend this course if you want a nice introduction as a programmer. Even though people disliked the teaching style, I was quite fond of the humor.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>24</course_id><course_title>Game Theory</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>120891</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Greg van de Krol</reviewer_name><other_review_count>4</other_review_count><other_course_completed>4</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/greg30</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-05-05</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I am very grateful that such demanding courses are available free online.

The lectures in this course are not long enough or detailed enough to understand the concepts. They do cover the theory but not enough practical examples to help the students take the problem sets. The second problem are the examples. Only a few examples are given and they are completely uninteresting. Battle of the sexes, prisoners dilemma, matching pennies, none of those games make any sense or have any real practical application. I would have loved a peer reviewed assignment were the game theory concepts could be applied to a practical real world problem. I leave the course with the feeling game theory is only a theoretical concept, mostly based on common sense without a real application to the real world.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>42</course_id><course_title>Social Network Analysis</course_title><school>School:  University of Michigan</school><review_data_id>110494</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-07-14</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>The course was fascinating.

The topics are modern they are presented in a clear and interesting way along with many examples. Gephi and Netlogo are used to create simulations, models and analysis of social networks. Something to highlight about this course is that all of the examples, excercises and programming assignments really made sense, using interesting data for interesting and diverse problems. I loved the idea of a final peer-graded project with 3 different optional areas to cover and an open subject. It's fun and interesting to do and fun and interesting to grade and see what the other students did. This is a fun course with many interesting topics presented in an excellent way.

I quite enjoyed the videos: Lada has a casual style and is clearly passionate about the course content. Sometimes the quiz answers were unclear, but I think on the whole the test material was good (the quizzes could be repeated, so ambiguous questions would not impact the final grade). I didn't do the peer-reviewed assignments, as they looked far too difficult compared to the content of the lectures. In the end, I think the course was an enjoyable ride, but I feel like I'm missing very important pieces. I would like to know more about collecting data, for example. After the course I bought O'Reilly's excellent "Mining the Social Web", which explains quite a lot about getting data from social networks, blogs and other sites, and complemented well what I learned from this Coursera course. It would also be nice and interesting to have a more in-depths course (either as a separate course or as additional weeks), to continue learning about network analysis in all its forms.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>12672</course_id><course_title>Emergence of Life</course_title><school>School:  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</school><review_data_id>57293</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Ramiro Aznar</reviewer_name><other_review_count>27</other_review_count><other_course_completed>26</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/ramiroaznar1</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-10-01</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>I have deepen my knowledge on this matter.

I was hoping we would get some interesting information about origins of life, but it looks like the entire OOL content of the course is about 5 minutes of vague, grade-school level explanation with no supporting evidence. You'd learn a hundred times more just from reading Wikipedia for a bit, which is sad. Worse, the initial lectures are full of factual errors and the quizzes are the worst I've seen on Coursera in terms of grading errors and ambiguous questions. The course seems to have been created to glorify Carl Woese and get him name recognition, and it verges on propaganda. It's interesting that he developed a phylogenetic technique and discovered Archaea, but statements like "before Woese, Biology wasn't even a science" seem ridiculous. The lectures do get better as the course progresses, but it wasn't really what I was looking for.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>3</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>12672</course_id><course_title>Emergence of Life</course_title><school>School:  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</school><review_data_id>42636</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Charles King</reviewer_name><other_review_count>5</other_review_count><other_course_completed>4</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/charlesking</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-07-22</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>This course seems to be aimed at VERY low level. Don't take it expecting to learn much about Carl Woese's work, despite his prominence in the advert. All the references to him covered were the fact that he discovered Archaea and is a Great Man (really, all they managed to do was convey the idea that someone has a chip on his shoulder). It would have been much more useful if, instead of talking about how many grants he was refused, they covered things like horizontal gene transfer or RNAWorld with more than a passing mention. The videos are certainly quite professional and smart, but the content is severely lacking.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>2</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69</course_id><course_title>Nutrition for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention</course_title><school>School:  University of California, San Francisco</school><review_data_id>4377</review_data_id><reviewer_name>sam tan</reviewer_name><other_review_count>33</other_review_count><other_course_completed>31</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/samt</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-12-10</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Probably the best of the nutrition courses out there as the material is well- delivered, well-organized and packed with useful information for the general public to adopt - Information that is based on solid evidence-based research.

I enjoyed this course very much. There was a great guest lecturer about fiber. Miss Ferraro had a funny stilted way of talking. One of the other reviewers said it was because she was using a teleprompter. I guess that makes sense, but I wasn't thinking about the reason 'for' her speaking that much. Anyway, the peer assignments were the most time consuming thing in the course, with the final one requiring you to make a recipe and analyze its health benefits (you had to post pictures of it too). One bad thing was that much of the course felt like a laundry list of different organizations eating charts they created, and Miss Ferraro was just going through them all. There was a lot of research data interspersed, but sometimes it wasn't enough between all the eating charts. It's a very heavy data driven course, and Miss Ferraro gracefully avoids falling into the many controversial health areas -- although the forum was full of these!!! Recommended course.

I see some concepts from this course returning. And I do like tutorials. Not less important, I have less patience than most people for things that bore me. I cannot for example complete networking classes when they delved into concepts which can be summed very quickly.

I recommend this class to anyone who is interested about CS or Startup Engineering (Technically I thought it would be harder you should at-least have one preliminary intro to computing course the best one is MIT's edx 6..00 and Udacity's one is pretty fun also.

Anyway, if you are looking for a refresher or foundations course then the lecturers provide very clear lessons in grammar. I was also sure to report some plagiarism in the form of an assessment copy and pasted from wikipedia. I became suspicious due to the way in which the piece was written, determining that it was plagiarism after copying and pasting the first two lines into a google search.

Discussion forums were very active with lots of useful hints and discussions, including involvement and comments by course instructors. However, assignments from week 3 onwards were very difficult and required several hours of additional research in order to understand how to solve them (for some assignments I stopped after scoring 7/10 as I had used up all my free time). I spent about 10 hours work per week to complete this course. Scala software installation and automatic upload and grading of assignments worked well for me.

Before explaining why I will start with a disclaimer. This course is one of the first in the category "abandonmoocs" you have the lectures and the quizzes but you are completely on your own, the instructor is not present and there are no TAs or any kind of help whatsoever, so in some way this is the same as just a list of videos on youtube. But the content is terrific and the instructor is a genius!. This course covers very very interesting topics such as PCA, Independent component analysis, image segmentation, signal processing and many other topics and the way the topics are presented is terrific. First you get a great lecture about the theory behind each subject, the instructor takes time to make very difficult concepts simple and he does it without losing depth in the topics. Not only that but he is also fun and presents really nice examples for each topic. Then you get a "practice" lecture where the instructor codes the different algorithms in real time using Matlab, this was awersome as you could just reproduce the code at the same time and understand how things work and what very nice things you can do with the algorithms. There's nothing remotely similar to this course so I give it six stars even in its current state of abandonment.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>250</course_id><course_title>Computational Methods for Data Analysis</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>4925</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Doug Steel</reviewer_name><other_review_count>2</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/dougsteel</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-01-28</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I am enjoying this course and is giving me a good theoretical background to the signal processing I have been doing lately. Nathan Kutz is a great lecturer and covers the material in an engaging and sometimes humorous manner, illustrating what can be quite a dry subject with interesting real life examples. The associated lecture notes are an excerpt from his book an are well written. Useful practical lessons with MATLAB and a **FREE** MATLAB license for the duration of the course (better support for Octave would have been ideal). However.... It is just a series of videos of his classroom lectures, which are great, but not always suited to watching online. The quizzes are basic and sometimes are just "do this in MATLAB, did you do it yes/no ?". There is no forum participation from the lecturer or TAs. And no certificate of completion available if that interests you (doesn't bother me much, I'm doing this out of interest). In summary, interesting course, but could be so much better.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>2</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>250</course_id><course_title>Computational Methods for Data Analysis</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>4875</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Dan</reviewer_name><other_review_count>9</other_review_count><other_course_completed>9</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/dan5</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-01-22</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>Class wasn't bad, it's a tutorial of many different computational methods. Having a lot to cover, it doesn't go deep at all, but at least the teacher identifies some key points (e.g. time vs. frequency in analysis) and illustrated them well. In the end, I don't think this class gave me much for the time I spent (lectures are quite long) as it was too superficial for my interests. The best part was probably showing what matlab functions and toolkits can be used for the various problems; even though only a few commands were used for each domain, it can be a good start for a beginner needing to get oriented.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>214</course_id><course_title>Malicious Software and its Underground Economy: Two Sides to Every Story</course_title><school>School:  University of London</school><review_data_id>3749</review_data_id><reviewer_name>vaggelas</reviewer_name><other_review_count>28</other_review_count><other_course_completed>26</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/vaggelas</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-11-10</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>This is a course abouth malware and virus,their history and how they work.

Media is currently undergoing a transformational change and I thought this course might provide some interesting insights. It has been interesting but not in depth enough for my taste. I should point out  that I have worked in media and communications for more than a decade. The weekly reading lists are relevant, through-provoking and, for the most part, timely.  While Prof. Youngman does include several books in the reading lists and he does reference those authors regularly in his lectures, course participants do not have to have read the books in order to complete the course or succeed in the quizzes. The lectures include a sense of fun but could delve more into strategy, consequences and ethics. The quizzes are too easy and I do not find the weekly writing assignment give me additional insights. They feel like make-work projects. Despite these criticisms I have learned a lot about Google, search and the shifting content paradigm - that has certainly been worthwhile. I recommend the instructor - he's passionate about his subject. I would have liked the course to be a little more challenging.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>414</course_id><course_title>Understanding Media by Understanding Google</course_title><school>School:  Northwestern University</school><review_data_id>29005</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Hamideh Iraj</reviewer_name><other_review_count>65</other_review_count><other_course_completed>55</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/hamidehiraj</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-04-14</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>The course title was interesting but it had nothing to say.

There were 3 levels of completion. Awareness - which you can get from watching videos about basics of planning, and its usage in real world. This videos were really boring and, unfortunately, needed to complete higher levels of completions. Exam part of this was multiple choice test. Foundation - knowledge of using algorithms presented in lectures, like A*, planning in STRIPS etc. Lectures that weren't about awareness level were much more substantial and interesting, than others. Exam part for this part was not-multiple choice test, where you need to simulate some algorithms. Like stating what nodes would search A* algorithm in gives case. If you have experience on AI or just programming it shouldn't be too difficult too you. Performance - there were programming assignments in which you were to implement simple cases of algorithms mentioned in lecture. Language was free to choose. On one hand it is a good thing, on the other hand it limits possibilities of how to test whether you should get point. Sending code like in Scala course is rather out of question, so it took form of asking similar questions like in Foundation part, but which were too difficult to answer without using program. To complete each stage, you had to pass previous stage, which was frustrating when you wanted just to program things. Staff response on forum also could have been a bit quicker. I think that course would be better if there would be option for those who takes programming path to gain points on more advanced assignments instead of taking previous levels. And maybe there could be at least one part where you wouldn't have choice in programming language, but there would be grading similar to that in Scala course. Before taking Scala course I would give it 4 stars, but now I see that it could be done better.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>92</course_id><course_title>Artificial Intelligence Planning</course_title><school>School:  The University of Edinburgh</school><review_data_id>1195</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Michal</reviewer_name><other_review_count>6</other_review_count><other_course_completed>5</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/michal</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-03-25</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>Don't take my rating too serious, as I didn't take enough of the course, but here's my impression.

I can see that the authors have put a lot of effort into the course and tried to get people involved using various ways (including tweets, achievments, creative challenges), but it didn't work for me, even though I'm interested in the topic.

The instructor doesn't care about making the concepts simple he just mumbles around formulas and papers without examples. As any student and instructor knows complex subjects can be explained if you create simple examples to show how things work in practice this course doesn't care about that. I also disliked the programming assignment that uses a very strange platform and asks the students to complete very simple tasks without any interesting goal.

The course covers a variety of topics in text data mining and natural language processing including text retrieval, query ranking and evaluation methods, methods and the basics of recommender systems. Grading is based entirely on 4 weekly quizzes comprised of 10 multiple choice questions. You only get 1 attempt on the quizzes. The weekly content in Text Retrieval and Search Engines consists of around 10 video lectures that range from 5 to 20 minutes followed by a short 10 question quiz. If that sounds like a lot of lecture per question, it is, and there are no in-lecture quizzes to reinforce concepts as you go along. The lectures themselves are definitely a step up from the first course in the specialization, Pattern Discovery in Data Mining. The professor isn't hard to understand this time around and he explains concepts well enough to grasp them without having to re-watch videos. As with many of Coursera's other 4-week specializations, however, lectures sometimes turn into information dumps where the professor ends up reading off slides. The course does have a C++ programming assignment which was nice to see. Text Retrieval and Search Engines is a decent course that is worth a look if you are interested in text data mining and search engines. Although the lectures lackluster, they have some good information. If you're planning on getting a verified certificate, it is a good idea to try the practice quizzes before submitting the real one. I give this course 2.75 out of 5 stars: Fair.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>28661</course_id><course_title>Text Retrieval and Search Engines</course_title><school>School:  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</school><review_data_id>74437</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-05-02</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>The course has a great content on various popular retrieval methods used in practical search engines.

Each week was dedicated to a different question such as "What is ageing?", "What is it to be old?", "What is an aging society?" etc. In addition to lectures about these topics the participants were asked to answer this question through a submission of their choice. These submissions were then read and graded by peers. All in all it was a very interesting experience. I only found the couse quite US-centric (e.g. one lecture bored me a bit because as a German I don't need convincing that free health insurance is a good thing) and towoards the end some aspects seemed to repeat themselves. The same happened in the student submissions because the questions often overlapped. For example I almost read the same essay about the question "What is it to age well?" and the question "What do ageing societies need to do to prepare for the future?" I also would have liked a few more practical recommendations about what can be done to age better. Still I recommend this course to people who are interesting in this very intriguing topic of changing demographics in the US and the rest of the world.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>458</course_id><course_title>Growing Old Around the Globe</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>43569</review_data_id><reviewer_name>WB</reviewer_name><other_review_count>14</other_review_count><other_course_completed>14</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/wb</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-07-28</review_date><review_value>3</review_value><review>This course is different from other MOOCs as it does not involve lecture slides.

The course is a 4-week overview of data clustering: unsupervised learning methods that attempt to group data into clusters of related or similar observations. The course covers two most common clustering methods--K means and hierarchical clustering--as well as more than a dozen other clustering algorithms. Grading is based on 4 weekly quizzes with 3 attempts each. Cluster Analysis is taught by Professor Jiawei Han who was the instructor for the first course in the data mining specialization: Pattern Discovery in Data Mining. The quality of the slides, instruction and organization of materials in this course is slightly better than the pattern discovery course, but that isn't saying much: it is still below Coursera's usual high standards. The course rushes from one topic to another with instruction that is mediocre at best downright confusing at its worst. That's not to say you can't learn anything from this course, but the instruction is often more of a hindrance than a help. There are occasional in-lecture quizzes, but the graded quizzes largely fail to foster any understanding of the material. An optional programming assignment was added half way through the course; in a course about data mining, programming assignments should be front and center, not added as an afterthought to quell an outcry from students. Cluster Analysis in Data Mining is another disappointing entry in Coursera's data mining specialization. Although the course covers many different clustering methods, poor instruction makes it hard to gain a good understanding of the material unless you are extremely attentive or watch the videos several times. I give Cluster Analysis in Data Mining 2 out of 5 stars: Poor.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>28662</course_id><course_title>Cluster Analysis in Data Mining</course_title><school>School:  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</school><review_data_id>74631</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Hamideh Iraj</reviewer_name><other_review_count>65</other_review_count><other_course_completed>55</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/hamidehiraj</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-06-24</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>This course is my first MOOC in machine learning that goes beyond introductory level and explores clustering algorithms in 4 weeks. This is generally a low-quality course. The syllabus is interesting technically but spiritless due to the lack of context and use cases to give a meaning to algorithms. The lectures are deadly boring. The instructor obviously lacks teaching and communication skills and most of the time he is reading from the slides. This course helps you to know only the titles of available clustering algorithms . You will not learn any of them. It only warms you up to study the subjects later. I am taking this course just to get an idea about clustering algorithms and self-study in demand. It is worth spending about two hours a week for watching each week videos and doing the quizzes in one our or so. This is the first run of the course and it has many ways to improve.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>28662</course_id><course_title>Cluster Analysis in Data Mining</course_title><school>School:  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</school><review_data_id>110200</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Richard Taylor</reviewer_name><other_review_count>29</other_review_count><other_course_completed>28</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/richardtaylor</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-06-30</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>This is a good course on Clustering algorithms. The instructor covers a lot of topics and provides good examples to understand the most important algorithms. I liked the detailed and numerous examples that were explained through the course. It is not a perfect course as real-life applications of clustering are missing and the programming assignment doesn't make any sense but overall I liked the content and how it was presented.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>25392</course_id><course_title>Process Mining: Data science in Action</course_title><school>School:  Eindhoven University of Technology</school><review_data_id>117243</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Karthikeyan Sankaran</reviewer_name><other_review_count>4</other_review_count><other_course_completed>4</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/karthikeyansankaran</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-01-01</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Process Mining gave me insights into an area of Data Science, which I think is largely neglected - 'Process Optimization'. In general, there is too much focus on data without an understanding of the underlying process that generates the data. This course provides the foundation to treat 'Process' at the same level of 'Data' when it comes to Data Science. I thoroughly enjoyed the lectures and assignments. Professor was great and inspirational. I felt that on the topic of Process Discovery there was a bit too much theory than necessary. All in all, a great course for a well rounded Data Scientist.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>25392</course_id><course_title>Process Mining: Data science in Action</course_title><school>School:  Eindhoven University of Technology</school><review_data_id>114067</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Kristina Šekrst</reviewer_name><other_review_count>64</other_review_count><other_course_completed>64</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/sekrst</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-10-08</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I was a bit late with this course, and it seemed boring, but it got my attention when I tried the tool quiz. Then I went over all the lectures again, and tried to see the applications of the theoretical models. There was a lot of Petrie net stuff going on, so if you're looking for practice mostly, this won't be fun. However, I did enjoy real-life examples, but sometimes I was a bit lost in the quizzes with all the complicated networks. Nevertheless, I always recommend this course to everyone who wants to learn about a bit neglected discipline, and I'm strongly recommending it to learn awesome new tools. The instructor was nice, and the TA Joos pretty much single-handedly answered every possible doubt in the forums, and I was hugely impressed by that. The course also features the Process Mining group on LinkedIn, and that's a nice way to stay in touch. All in all, a recommendation, but with a caveat if you're expecting more practice rather than theory.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>25392</course_id><course_title>Process Mining: Data science in Action</course_title><school>School:  Eindhoven University of Technology</school><review_data_id>67404</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-01-07</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>I expected to learn the concepts and applications of process mining. All of this was delivered. Like: \- course material content AND presentation was excellent - the videos were extremely good - one of the best I have seen so far on coursera \- Tool Support - The tools were easy to install and easy to use - no programming required! \- Hands-on Exercises were included - so one could actually create models from logs, analyze the models and became familiar with the functionality of 2 Process Mining tools. Focus was on process discovery, performance analysis, conformance checking What I missed: \- hands-on excercises for extraction of event-logs (notice: this might be a boring task but is extremely important) - usually the majority of time in data mining projects is spent on getting, understanding, filtering, cleansing data \- hands-on exercises for more advanced topics (prediction, recommendation) / operative support settings \- combination of RapidMiner / ProM While having said what I missed - it is clear that these things could or should be added in another subsequent course.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>25392</course_id><course_title>Process Mining: Data science in Action</course_title><school>School:  Eindhoven University of Technology</school><review_data_id>61268</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Richard Taylor</reviewer_name><other_review_count>29</other_review_count><other_course_completed>28</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/richardtaylor</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-12-17</review_date><review_value>5</review_value><review>I just finished the last week of this course and I find very difficult to write a review about this course, it has a lot of positive and negative things at the same time. I'll try to sum up the pluses and minuses I found: Positive things: \- Extremely well prepared material, lots of examples, clear explanations, top-quality video and audio. Top-notch. \- Fantastic instructor. Clear, precise and always right, the concepts are delivered in a perfect way. \- Excellent response time in the forums and support to the students. \- Very well prepared quizzes with many questions to make you learn the materials and apply the concepts to the questions. Negative things: \- The course is too long, too many topics, too many videos, it could have been split in 2, 3 or even 4 smaller courses. \- Peer Assignment: it is too long, the dataset is totally boring and uninteresting and it only counts for the distinction certificate. \- The tools being used: Prom and Disco. Disco is a commercial tool and Prom has many flaws and bugs. \- Lectures are too long, too many videos per week and the pace is too slow. (It is ok at 1.5x video speed) I started this course with a lot of energy and liked its start very much, my interest quickly waned to the point of wanting to drop the course badly. The course fails to deliver a real world case to apply the tools being used for something interesting, something fun, something worth it. The peer assignment was a huge letdown as I was expecting a fun application of the topics learned and instead found a longer tool-quiz where you have to use Disco and Prom to process yet another boring and uninteresting dataset. My conclusion is that process-mining is a very interesting field where very cool algorithms can be applied but in the end the work is boring and tedious and the tools that we have available today are not fun to use and full of bugs. It's a good course so long and so detailed that you will learn to love or hate the topic unfortunately for me it was the second. I can give this course 1 star and 5 stars at the same time. You be the judge.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>115</course_id><course_title>Creative, Serious and Playful Science of Android Apps</course_title><school>School:  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</school><review_data_id>7102</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jeanne Boyarsky</reviewer_name><other_review_count>33</other_review_count><other_course_completed>29</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/boyarsky</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-02-22</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>This course targets people without programming experience. It teaches how to use Eclipse (Android Developer Toolkit), the basics of Java and how to create an Android application with minimal programming. The second half of the class covers more programming (although still not a ton) but provides a logical stopping point in case you want to stop before that. I think it might have been too fast paced to actually learn Java. As a Java developer, I found the course too easy. I mainly took it to get the software installed and get an overview of Android before the more computer science based "Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems" started in January. I'm glad I did. It was a fun course and gave me a feel for Android. The three programming assignments had room for creativity making the peer review fun. I made a small Tic Tac Toe app for my final project. The quizzes appeared to be a subset of the end of video questions. Which is fine for reinforcement, but less interesting for checking understanding. Each week, there was a list of things to do. I liked that there was a time estimate for each week in addition to the coursera average one.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>3</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>115</course_id><course_title>Creative, Serious and Playful Science of Android Apps</course_title><school>School:  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</school><review_data_id>7185</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Connie</reviewer_name><other_review_count>10</other_review_count><other_course_completed>9</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/connie</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-03-23</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>Prior Experience: 5 months of Android Programming Experience Level of difficulty: As a beginner course, this level of difficulty of this course is acceptable General impression: Instructor seems to cover area of topics he likes best instead of teaching components that are essential to building practical Android application.

It comes from one of the top computer science departments in the world, so it should be better than this. The installation problems of Android SDK are significant and this class only covers some of them. Many students dropped out during the first week of this class soley because of this - if you can't get Android running on your system, the rest of the class is pointless. The first 5 weeks of the class are supposed to be for non-programmers, but the professor goes through steps so quickly you are constantly pausing the videos, going back, trying to do what he is doing, not necessarily understanding why, sometimes he doesn't even mention a step which may cause your code not to run, etc. Because Android SDK/Java is so complicated, for a beginners class, the instructions need to be flawless. And they aren't here. OTOH, I have a hunch other MOOCs may handle such a class even worse, so I finished this class. We'll see when another slightly less highly ranked university (Maryland) offers a similar class at the end of January.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>28660</course_id><course_title>Pattern Discovery in Data Mining</course_title><school>School:  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</school><review_data_id>110198</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Richard Taylor</reviewer_name><other_review_count>29</other_review_count><other_course_completed>28</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/richardtaylor</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-06-30</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>This course has some nice content but the presentation is very boring.

Keeping with the trend of other specialization courses, pattern discovery in data mining spans 4 weeks and will likely be offered again each month or two after the first offering. The course covers a range of methods for finding different types of patterns in data, such as association rules and patterns in graphs. Grading is based exclusively on 4 weekly quizzes. I was excited to see the new data mining specialization come up on Coursera to kick off 2015, but unfortunately, pattern discovery in data mining is a dull, poorly executed information dump. Besides an interesting topic, there’s not much going for this course. In the lectures, the professor reads information off dense slides and his delivery is more confusing than instructive. The slides, video and sound are of decent quality, but the explanations are not clear and while I normally don't have an issue with foreign accents, the professor's English made things harder to understand. To make things worse, there are few instructive in lecture quizzes and no activities or programming assignments. A course about data mining should have programming assignments or activities that let students interact with the concepts to reinforce learning. Pattern discovery in data mining is a disappointing start to the data mining specialization, that suffers from poor instruction quality and lack of illustrative assignments. Taking this course is like a data mining problem in and of itself: you have to spend a lot of time deciphering the lectures to uncover useful information.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>28660</course_id><course_title>Pattern Discovery in Data Mining</course_title><school>School:  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</school><review_data_id>71918</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Miguel Asencio</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>0</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/miguelasencio</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-02-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Just awesome!

However, he is not a teaching specialist, so learning the material is somewhat of a challenge (somewhat more so for those unfamiliar with east Asian accented English.) For those having problems learning solely by the videos provided, I recommend reading the free chapters from his book, which the course is based on. It is good that the instructor has setup forum subforums, such that there is a subforum for each video in the class. I wish there was programming in the class as I find that often helps me to better learn the material. The material is somewhat abstract so you have to concentrate more in this MOOC.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>385</course_id><course_title>Video Games and Learning</course_title><school>School:  University of Wisconsin–Madison</school><review_data_id>41123</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jodi Millard</reviewer_name><other_review_count>5</other_review_count><other_course_completed>3</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/jodimillard</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-07-07</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Very engaging course.

I was also interested in having some new element about the controversy about violence and video games (I thought of this as a possible drawback of what we learn through video games). I dropped after the first two weeks as I felt the content was biased towards the interest of the instructor's research. It seemed to me that the objective of the course was to present the opinions and beliefs of the instructors rather than to show the state of the art of the current scientific knowledge (none of the drawbacks of video games was mentioned as if it is the ultimate educational tool). Moreover, the "commercial" style of some of the videos did not help me lower my doubts about the content quality and accuracy. The materials were undoubtedly well designed but I preferred to concentrate on other courses such as "Epidemics - the Dynamics of Infectious Diseases" that is also well produced (the content of this last course seemed to me quite accurate as far as I could check). In terms of similar courses on the topic of education, I would suggest "How to Learn Math", which address an crucial issue in education.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>385</course_id><course_title>Video Games and Learning</course_title><school>School:  University of Wisconsin–Madison</school><review_data_id>3400</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Justine Ivan</reviewer_name><other_review_count>15</other_review_count><other_course_completed>9</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/justineivan</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-10-17</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>So far this MOOC has been great. It is well produced. The audience, everyone, is very well taken into consideration. The workload per week will really depend on the level of participation and the 'gaming' you would do as part of the assignment/analysis but I wouldn't call that "workload". I don't see signs of quizzes anywhere. This is one MOOC where the participants are very active in the forums and you can really get quality interactions. I've chosen 4/5 rating based on the first week only and the "medium" difficulty as a neutral choice for the meantime. I thought this MOOC is best for parents and educators to help them understand gaming and make use of it as a mean of education rather than being completely against it all the time.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>3361</course_id><course_title>21st Century American Foreign Policy</course_title><school>School:  Duke University</school><review_data_id>3697</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Winthrop Yu</reviewer_name><other_review_count>33</other_review_count><other_course_completed>27</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/winthropyu</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-11-02</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Good syllabus - starting with (development of) foreign relations policy within the US, then going through each of the major geographical regions in turn.

The course finished. No grades. Minimal communications from course staff. Weeks go by. No response to increasingly agitated and numerous messages on the boards asking when grades will be issued. Months go by. No grades. A staff member finally came on and said hand grading the assignments took a long time. Um... yeah. With thousands of students hand grading isn't really an option. I can't figure out what Coursera was thinking to allow that, or what the staff was thinking to propose it. We finally got our certificates the third week of February, and many people are complaining that they were given an incorrect grade. The class was over in November. As far as content, the info presented was based on pretty limited assumptions, although what was presented within those constraints was very well done. There were some really great discussions on the boards about all subjects, both within and without the given constraints.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>3460</course_id><course_title>Understanding and Improving the US Healthcare System</course_title><school>School:  University of Michigan</school><review_data_id>7076</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Paul Laub</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/paullaub</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-02-22</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I took this class in Nov/Dec 2013 through Coursera. Overall, the course was both informative and also a disaster for those like myself who sought a Certificate of Accomplishment. Pros (what was good): I gained a framework to better understand the US healthcare system, better appreciating the perspectives of the four main players: patients, payers, providers, and public health. I grappled with what in healthcare is important to me -- and what is not -- in doing the "CHAT" exercises. It involved allocating (effectively rationing) scarce healthcare resources. For example, is more comprehensive primary care more valuable to you than cutting edge specialty treatments? You can't have them both. (Clearly, there is no "right" answer, just your answer.) For all of this, five of five stars. Kudos Dr. Davis and staff. Cons (the disaster): Grading took months, not weeks, and I and many others (judging from the discussion boards) received failing grades (66.7%) even though we dutifully did all of the assignments. Assignments were ungraded. My grade of 66.7 suggests that they lost track of one of my three assignments. I guess. Who knows? If you want a Statement of Accomplishment, don't get your hopes up! Moreover, it would be crazy to pay money to take this class on Signature Track. For this disaster, zero of five stars. Final grade: 2.5 stars. P.S. It is possible that Dr. Davis / U Michigan / Coursera might fix this situation (grades were finally released today, months late), but I am not optimistic. EDIT -- READ THIS TOO: Coursera / U Michigan / Dr. Davis and company did address the problem, and did fix the grading, so that I and many others (judging from the class discussion forums) received the proper grade. Hurray!! Therefore, with this problem fixed, I am changing my overall rating to 5 stars.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>6814</course_id><course_title>History and Future of (Mostly) Higher Education</course_title><school>School:  Duke University</school><review_data_id>70665</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Alison Bulbeck</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/alisonbulbeck</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-02-12</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Cathy Davison made a significant contribution towards showing how MOOCs of the future should be run using connectivist principles - the curriculum was fluid and adaptable, you could break into smaller work-groups and use social media collaborative tools (eg Google hangouts).

This is a very interesting - and totally correct - view. It is a perspective that may seem trivial at first, but it's often forgotten by people with "computational" and strict objectivist views about vision. It was an enlightening experience for that reason. The message was repeated many times and applied to many areas (color, light, etc.). If you're interested in this topic it is definitely a nice complement to other courses where other views are held. I would, though, be weary of mantras such as "color is not a property of the object" just because we experience color differently depending, for example, on contextual cues. There are objective physical properties of objects that relate to color, and light, and all aspects related to vision - if you define them that way. This course understands the psycho-physical component of vision only and so it naturally tends to see vision as subjective. It's interesting, just put it into perspective.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>20420</course_id><course_title>Powerful Tools for Teaching and Learning: Digital Storytelling</course_title><school>School:  University of Houston System</school><review_data_id>55701</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Mod Sat</reviewer_name><other_review_count>2</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/modsat998</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-09-29</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>very good thanks منتديات ثري جي شيرنج شبكة ومنتديات ودليل وموقع شامل كل الصيانه والهرد وير والسوفت وير وكل برامج الدش والستلايت شرح مصور وشيرنج مجاني متعة كامله من الترفيه. &lt;http://www.sharng-3g.com/vb/&gt; &lt;http://www.sharng-3g.com/vb/&gt; &lt;http://www.sharng-3g.com/vb/&gt;</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>20420</course_id><course_title>Powerful Tools for Teaching and Learning: Digital Storytelling</course_title><school>School:  University of Houston System</school><review_data_id>54140</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jeff Winchell</reviewer_name><other_review_count>91</other_review_count><other_course_completed>66</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/jeffwinchell1</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-01-27</review_date><review_value>5</review_value><review>One word review: Meh.

Students indeed get a lot of insight information about Russian people and it helped me to understand certain behaviors that I would not have been able to decode without this course.  In some weeks, there were external people contributing to the course which was a good diversion to the classes held by the instructor. The instructor Mira Bergelson is a person for which I have a deep respect, she is very committed to the topic and in general, has a profound knowledge about it. The teaching style is kind of strict and also quizzes demand that you have really paid attention during the lectures, but I actually prefer this style compared to MOOCs that I have attended from US- American universities. At first, I did not like the fact that the grading foresaw 10 points (out of 100) for the participation in the discussion forum, because normally I do not spend my time in such forums (actually because you can easily lose track of what you wanted or at least, this is my case). Since I did not want to lose those 10 points, I stepped in and discovered the interesting discussions going on there and surprise (!), the instructor was participating herself in some threads and contributed again with her knowledge and/or opinion. The assignments were though and demanded a lot of analysis and understanding of the Russian culture. The grading was strict, but again, I prefer those clear rules, also because people who are not 100% interested in the topic will disappear sooner or later.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>3363</course_id><course_title>Beginning Game Programming with C#</course_title><school>School:  University of Colorado System</school><review_data_id>3968</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Adrian Van</reviewer_name><other_review_count>3</other_review_count><other_course_completed>3</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/adrianvan</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-11-23</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Pretty easy for a non beginner in programming.

The lectures are clear and well paced, although the in- lecture quizzes refer to content that is about to be discussed rather than what was just covered. The first few assessments are well suited to the beginning programmer. Many other students (who have obvious familiarity with C#) submitted assessments that went wildly beyond what was asked. Since these assignments were peer assessed, the beginners struggled to mark those extracurricular works. On the forums, the authors of those excessive assignments were unapologetic to the noobs. The assignment at the 4 week mark represented a huge leap in difficulty and took many people upwards of 6 hours to complete. It did not correlate with much of the content covered by lectures that week and, in fact, many of the tasks related to content that had never been covered in the course. As a result a great loss of morale is evident in the forums. The forums themselves are a mixed blessing with requests for help being met by a mix of people who are genuinely trying to help (without giving the answers away) and people who seem to revel in saying "I'm a programmer, and this is what programming is, so figure it out for yourself." The lecturer responded VERY quickly at the beginning of the course when he realised that not everyone would be using a PC. He was able to get Mac and Linux IDE alternatives (and how to set up docs) posted before the first assignment was due. Impressive. However, at week 5 it is still not possible for many students to upload assessment videos. This requires people to find and use their own hosting solution (vimeo, youtube, dropbox, own website, etc) many of which negate the anonymous nature of peer assessment. Overall, I thought the lectures were good and Dr T is certainly personable, but the jump in difficulty could have been managed better by the course provider. Some hints on what to do when the class or method documentation makes no sense (because you're a beginner) would have been helpful, and (I think) more in the nature of the guided learning experience that I am more familiar with. The "work it out on your own" mentality that plagues the forums is disheartening for those who are trying, and struggling. For what it is, I'm sure that it is a beneficial course, but this is not a course for those new to programming (or C#).</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>93</course_id><course_title>Computational Neuroscience</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>114085</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Kristina Šekrst</reviewer_name><other_review_count>64</other_review_count><other_course_completed>64</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/sekrst</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-10-08</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>This course was a huge inspiration, but it required a lot of prerequisites in high-level mathematics and programming. Even though I've passed the course with high marks, the programming exercises took a lot of time, and the quizzes weren't easy. It's not an introductory course, but the first few lectures ought to be enough if you're looking for a glance into what CN is. However, I'd recommend giving more practical introduction to certain theoretical approaches studied, for example, to combine the formula given in the slides with ways how to calculate them in Python and similar. I'm giving it one star more because the lecturers had done a huge job by themselves.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>93</course_id><course_title>Computational Neuroscience</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>1946</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Equanimous Creativity</reviewer_name><other_review_count>33</other_review_count><other_course_completed>32</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/equanimouscreativity</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-06-12</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>This course have the potential to be a great course. To get the most out of this course you should have some background knowledge in programming, machine learning, information theory, electrical circuits, bioelectricity or else you might get overwhelmed by the complex math used in the course. But if that is not a problem for you then it is a very inspirational course. I join to get new ideas for brain inspired AI techniques, and I got a couple of new ones while learning how the brain process information. The biggest problem holding the course back from being a great course is that they do not provide the lecture slides for download. Citing copyright problems as the reason. I find that access to the slides is the most important thing of a MOOC after the lecture videos. Also the course only had the 2 lectures working on it not a team like most MOOCs, it showed but those 2 did a fantastic job. I think that next it runs most of the problem will be solved and if you have the math skills and the interest I will recommend it.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>4</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>398</course_id><course_title>Law and the Entrepreneur </course_title><school>School:  Northwestern University</school><review_data_id>7064</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Eric Snellman</reviewer_name><other_review_count>2</other_review_count><other_course_completed>2</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/ericsnellman</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-02-18</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>The course included a portions of a textbooks which i found valuable.

The programming assignments are in python, which I had only previously used in another Coursera class. If you know about pixels, the problems solved in the programming assignments are trivial (e.g. convert an image to grayscale), while if you don't know about pixels it might be a good introduction. I spent most of the assignments time to understand how to do simple things in python (e.g. data type conversions), so while this may be useful, it feels wrong (see the Machine Learning class as an example of a better structure for assignments, where the trivial parts of the assignments were done for you and you had to spend most of the time implementing the interesting parts and even solving some real problems). Good class to get an overview of what computational photography is and get excited about it, but you will learn nothing in practice other than very simple operations like greyscale conversion (huge disconnect between class topics and programming assignments). It could become a very good class if the programming assignments actually taught us how to register images and implement other algorithms, even if using various libraries as building blocks. For example, the class introduction gives the impression that you will then be able to register images, but it doesn't tell you that you will only be able to do that by using ready-made applications (which anybody can already use even without taking this class) and only gain a little more insight of how those apps might work, but not by coding it yourself, or gaining detailed enough knowledge to be able to do it. I really hope that this class may be followed by more advanced classes where we actually implement a subset of the covered algorithms. One algorithm which had a slightly deeper treatment (and even a simplified programming assignment for it!) as it's a field of research for the author was automatically creating seamless loop animations from movies (think Bing webpage videos), although only at a basic level... pretty fascinating!</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>85</course_id><course_title>Computational Photography</course_title><school>School:  Georgia Institute of Technology</school><review_data_id>3151</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Gavin Conran</reviewer_name><other_review_count>25</other_review_count><other_course_completed>25</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/gavinconran</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-08-31</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>This class was a natural follow on from the UoW / Coursera course on Computational Methods for Data Analysis.

The lack of any form of evalutation and of a certificate discouraged efforts on that side, so I feel like I learned the theory but I would not be able to parallelize a real code.

It is a light, well-humored introduction to the subject of how the brain deals with space. The lecturer is a tremendous professor - simple but quite effective. The only reason why it's not yet a 5-star course is because it would be nice if it contained more advanced materials and/or if it was longer (6 weeks, less than 1 hour per week, is really not that much). Still, if you're interested in the topic, and even more so if it's your first time learning about neuro-related-stuff, you'll have a great time.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>2</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>12685</course_id><course_title>The Brain and Space</course_title><school>School:  Duke University</school><review_data_id>36086</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Carolina Sh.</reviewer_name><other_review_count>9</other_review_count><other_course_completed>7</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/carolinash</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-06-20</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>The lectures were entertaining and very clear, although slightly superficial.

This class explores the fundamentals of modern terrorism and counterterrorism in order to give a deeper context to help understand 9/11. (Part II will explore the response to 9/11, including the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, drone strikes, changes in law like the USA PATRIOT act and more.) It's a challenging subject, since it is still deeply emotional to many people around the world, and most of us simply don't have enough world perspective to understand things like religious extremist violence in context. The class attempts to address that by covering the details of 9/11, the difficulty of defining terrorism, the basic principles of Islam, the ideology of al-Qai'da, how people can be transformed from peaceful citizens to terrorists and how counterterrorism has changed as a result of 9/11. The lectures and student discussions are good, but the real stars are the reading material and the Google hangouts. Prof. Schanzer guides you through exploring primary source material like bin Laden's "Messages to the World" and Sayyid Qutb's "Milestones," and original research like Marc Sageman's "Leaderless Jihad" and Martin Miller's "The Foundations of Modern Terrorism." Amazingly, he has also made it possible for students to question experts like Peter Bergen who has interviewed bin Laden, Jessica Stern who has interviewed mujahideen and other religious extremists, as well as Imam Abdullah Antepli, historian Martin Miller and 9/11 memorial museum director Jan Ramirez. This class may be disappointing if you're looking for exploration of alternative theories about 9/11 like how it was a hoax carried out by the CIA or Mossad agents, etc. Analyzing these conspiracy theories and the groups promoting them could potentially make an interesting class in itself, but it is not addressed here. If your background is anything like mine, I think you'll find a large amount of new and interesting material here that can deepen your understanding of this important event and broaden your perspective on today's world.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>3277</course_id><course_title>Understanding 9/11: Why Did al Qai’da Attack America?</course_title><school>School:  Duke University</school><review_data_id>3669</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Graham Turner</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>0</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/grahamturner</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-11-01</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>A complete academic whitewash which fails to address the true history of Islam and its unrelenting jihad against all nonbelievers. it presents the politically correct version of Islam and feels completely to explore the violence that is contained throughout the sacred texts of Islam prior experience based on observing the creeping influence of Islam in Europe the course was very poor completely lacking in academic objectivity</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>35389</course_id><course_title>On Strategy: What Managers can learn from Philosophy - Part 2</course_title><school>School:  CentraleSupélec</school><review_data_id>74345</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-04-28</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I loved this course because the insights are both commonplace and profound.

It's great to enjoy a short review, and then indulge into reading. Quizzes were maybe to specific, but there is a wide array of possible topics to choose from when writing a peer-reviewed essay.

The good: the lectures were all great and given by a huge variety of very knowledgeable lecturers. Most of the readings were also really interesting, especially since many had been published recently so you were provided with the most up-to-date thinking on the subject out there. The way the course was structured was excellent as well - allowing for engagement with different types of materials depending on one´s background and interests. The bad: the quizzes felt rather pointless. They didn´t test whether you had engaged with the course contents, just whether or not you had read the lectures and read the materials. The mid-term exam was also too general to be of use - more specific questions would have been much better. The forums were really not that active compared to other MOOCs I´ve participated in, mainly due to the fact that there were no discussion questions posted for the topics covered each week and no real incentive for people to spend time posting on the forums. The citizen engagement project was a great idea, but I didn´t really feel it worked in practice - the guidelines were too general. All in all, I thought it was a good course with a lot of potential that taught me a lot, but there is definitely quite a bit of room for improvement for future rounds.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>52</course_id><course_title>Networks: Friends, Money, and Bytes</course_title><school>School:  Princeton University</school><review_data_id>58628</review_data_id><reviewer_name>S P</reviewer_name><other_review_count>4</other_review_count><other_course_completed>3</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/sp1</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-10-17</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review/><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50741</course_id><course_title>Machine Learning: Clustering &amp; Retrieval</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>123094</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Greg Hamel</reviewer_name><other_review_count>115</other_review_count><other_course_completed>106</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/greghamel</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-07-25</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Machine Learning: Clustering - Retrieval is the fourth course in the University of Washington's 6-part machine learning specialization on Coursera. The 6-week course covers several popular techniques for grouping unlabeled data and retrieving items similar to items of interest. After a short intro in week 1, the course covers k-nearest neighbor search, k-means clustering, Gaussian mixture models, latent Dirichlet allocation and hierarchical clustering. It is recommended that you complete the first 3 courses in the specialization track before taking this course, but you could take it as a standalone course as long as you know a bit of Python and probability. Grading is based on a series of comprehension quizzes and labs, but you must pay for a verified certificate to gain access to graded assignments. Thankfully you can still download and complete the labs without doing the associated quizzes, so you won't miss too much as a freeware student. Clustering and Retrieval has a good balance of lecture content and labs that illustrate concepts covered in lecture. The professor is easy to understand and the lecture slides and are well done. The course generally has good pacing and devotes plenty of time to each of the main weekly topics, taking care to explain important considerations like different algorithmic approaches to each method and similarities between different techniques. It does, however, go off on a couple tangents, introducing map reduce and hidden Markov models, neither of which are covered in much detail or addressed in the labs. The labs use a data set of Wikipedia articles about famous people as an example to illustrate clustering and retrieval. Using the same data set for multiple labs is always a good idea because it lets students focus on the techniques themselves instead of having familiarizing themselves with new data. The amount of actual coding you have to do in the labs is minimal. The labs are more like interactive explorations of machine learning techniques with occasional one-line fill in the blanks than full-on coding assignments. You'll spend more time reading text, running provided code and analyzing results than writing code yourself. You can look at and answer the lab quiz questions as you go along but you can't actually submit them and get graded feedback without joining the verified track. Machine Learning: Clustering - Retrieval is a great course that covers the many most common clustering techniques with adequate depth while remaining accessible. Although the coding required is minimal, it is not an easy course: some of the concepts may take a couple watch-troughs to sink in and you may struggle with certain concepts if you don't have prior knowledge of probability. Aside from the need to pay to gain access to graded quizzes and few topics that felt tacked on, there's not much to dislike about this course. I give Machine Learning: Clustering - Retrieval 4.5 out of 5 stars: Great.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>208</course_id><course_title>Linear and Discrete Optimization</course_title><school>School:  École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</school><review_data_id>43656</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Roman Shapovalov</reviewer_name><other_review_count>7</other_review_count><other_course_completed>7</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/romanshapovalov</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-07-31</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Quite nice theoretical course on linear programming and discrete optimization methods that can be reduced to that.

It is the first course in the “Executive Data Science” specialization, a data science track aimed at non-technical people like business managers. The course defines data science and then discusses different aspects of data science like statistics, machine learning and the structure, output and success metrics for data science projects. Grading is based on a handful of short multiple-choice comprehension quizzes. A Crash Course in Data Science is good for what it is: a brief overview of a field taught at a high level so that anyone can follow along. The professors have plenty of face time, explain concepts well and the video quality is good. The content quality is a definite step up from the original John Hopkins data science track. The only real knock against this course is its brevity and the fact that it costs the full $49 to get a verified certificate if you want to complete the specialization. A course that you can complete in an hour or two should not cost the same as a month-long course. Students looking to dig their teeth into something substantial for the first month of the Executive Data Science specialization may be disappointed. A Crash Course in Data Science is a well-made primer on the data science field, but its brevity may leave paying students wanting. For freeware students I give this course 4 out of 5 stars: Very Good.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16847</course_id><course_title>Better Leader, Richer Life</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>70600</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jeff Winchell</reviewer_name><other_review_count>91</other_review_count><other_course_completed>66</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/jeffwinchell1</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-02-09</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I have tried to take this a couple times now and have always been too busy, but since I'm making a huge change in my life over the next couple months, I figure now I will really complete the course. The "community" track of this course relies on peer review, which often scares away students who've taken a MOOC with peer reviews. However, one thing that impresses me, from a teaching style, in this MOOC is that it gives examples of what a good essay is like (the only other MOOC I've taken that had this is "Learning How to Learn"). Besides teaching you something, the essay examples also greatly lessen the fear of students incorrectly giving you a poor peer review. The peer reviews also have a minimum word count requirement, so you also don't spend a huge time on an essay, only to get a peer review with numbers and no words or barely useful comments like "That was nice".</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>12697</course_id><course_title>Discrete Inference and Learning in Artificial Vision</course_title><school>School:  CentraleSupélec</school><review_data_id>4846</review_data_id><reviewer_name>carole</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>0</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/carole1</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-01-15</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>An interesting first week...

I would recommend using other Python courses such as the track over at Codeacademy or Rice's introduction courses at Coursera. That being said, this course is a fine introduction to Python and you will see how it is applicable to Python. They will show you some extremely basic applications of Python in biology and show you sneak peaks at what you can do with Python for biology.

The material taught is definitely useful. The examples provided by the lecturer have value and allow for one to get a practical outlook on a theoretical concept. The readings assigned were appropriate and did help in cementing an idea. The quizzes have only one deadline, at the end of the course which does alleviate the pressure on students who want to balance multiple things and still get a statement of completion. The videos (thankfully) are short and I listened to most of them on a higher speed which made them shorter. The quiz questions are straight out of the content so there are no shockers. The way this course has been set up is to encourage people to engage with it and not feel pressure. Compared to other courses, this course was extremely easy, though I for one appreciated the simplicity of the material. The only thing I disliked was the ability to take a quiz 100 times and for each try of the quiz to just have questions re-arranged. Maybe if the quizzes were slightly more challenging, the course could still have been super easy yet give the students some manner of challenge.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50659</course_id><course_title>Data Visualization and Communication with Tableau</course_title><school>School:  Duke University</school><review_data_id>116805</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Greg Hamel</reviewer_name><other_review_count>115</other_review_count><other_course_completed>106</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/greghamel</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-12-17</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Data Visualization and Communication with Tableau is the third course in Duke University's "Excel to MySQL: Analytic Techniques for Business" specialization offered on Coursera. The 5-week course starts is essentially an introduction to Tableau (weeks 2 and 3) book-ended by some lectures on considerations and best practices for communicating data insights in a business setting (weeks 1 and 4.). The final week is devoted to a peer-reviewed assignment and has no new lecture content. The course provides you with a free temporary license for the desktop version of Tableau. You can get through his course without any background knowledge, although some knowledge of MS Excel will help you appreciate some of the comparisons it makes. Grading is based on 4 weekly quizzes and a peer graded assignment. Data Visualization has quality lectures that do a good job introducing Tableau in the context of creating visualizations for a business context. The Tableau walkthroughs are easy to follow and give you an appreciation for how much easier it is to make nice visualizations in Tableau than it is in Excel. You same data sets for the entire course, one data set for walkthoughs and one for homework assignments, which provides a nice sense of consistency. Weeks 1 and week 4 raise some useful considerations to keep in mind when preparing for and presenting a data analysis, but the Tableau sections in weeks 2 and 3 are the heart of the course. I would have preferred more content covering ins and outs of Tableau instead of the 2 weeks spent on communication topics, but the mix is probably about right for business-oriented students. I give Data Visualization and Communication with Tableau 4 out of 5 stars: very good.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50731</course_id><course_title>Scandinavian Film and Television</course_title><school>School:  University of Copenhagen</school><review_data_id>117676</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Victoria Li</reviewer_name><other_review_count>2</other_review_count><other_course_completed>2</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/victoria11</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-01-17</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>A good one.

An essay as a final assignment is also a huge plus since it makes you really get into the topic. Warning: lots of movies to watch and texts to read but if you really want to dig in the Scandinavian cinema (which is not just Bergman or Dreyer) that won't bother you at all.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>378</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Art: Concepts &amp; Techniques</course_title><school>School:  The Pennsylvania State University</school><review_data_id>2579</review_data_id><reviewer_name>makoto_inoue</reviewer_name><other_review_count>8</other_review_count><other_course_completed>7</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/makoto</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-07-16</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>This is the first non math/science related Coursera course I took, and I like the pair assignment reviews.

It's more of an introduction to astronomy, rather than introduction to exoplanetary astronomy. The lectures are nice, with interesting videos (loved the Dyson one!), too bad Princeton does not offer any certificates whatsoever, and that this course is an on-demand one.

The weekly quizzes are well written and with a interesting level of difficulty. It's common to fail here a few times but the retry it helps you to understand better what you saw in the video content. The assignments of this course probably are its main weak spot, specially regarding the progression on its level of difficulty: The first 3 weeks assignments are more like tutorials, with small datasets, of how to use R to play with some basic stats. They make a really good job on that but do not offer any challenges for the student, the student doesn't have to actually do much by himself, just fill in some data in some already given commands to place data in a quiz. The last assignment of the course is a totally different deal and it probably got by surprise almost everyone that did this course. It's a peer review, very open assignment that requests you to use R to complete a very open task using a quite large and complex dataset. I'm not sure if it was just because of how the difficulty of the course escalated here but, all the assignments that I've corrected were far of being complete, I never made a peer review in Coursera like this, where my colleagues work were so incomplete. I've managed to complete my assignment but I'm a experienced developer and I knew R fairly well before this class.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50800</course_id><course_title>Teach English Now!

A great course for any person interested in Finance. Cons: The lectures were a bit too long and it is difficult to take it at one sitting.

The specialization is really promising .The instructors did a great job of designing nice engaging courses.They carefully alleviated the problems of existing courses. Instead of PowerPoint, they used films to teach subjects. Instead of one voice, you hear the voice of different people. The use of Anaconda allows the student to get rid of installation and package management troubles at the very beginning. Instead of uploading your code and document, you post assignments on your blog. This minimizes the trouble of uploading and technical issues. In addition, you can show your posts to other people later. Last but not least, there are no quizzes to take up your time. You do four short assignments and it is done. In a nutshell, this is a carefully designed specialization. Highly recommended.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50309</course_id><course_title>Managing Big Data with MySQL</course_title><school>School:  Duke University</school><review_data_id>119273</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Greg Hamel</reviewer_name><other_review_count>115</other_review_count><other_course_completed>106</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/greghamel</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-03-11</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Managing Big Data with MySQL is the fourth and final course in Duke University's Excel to MySQL: Analytic Techniques for Business specialization offered through Coursera. The 5-week course focuses on teaching students how to make relational database queries. Unlike some database courses that delve into details concerning database construction and theory, this course is all about the practical use of databases from the perspective of a business analyst. The first week introduces the concept of relational databases, entity relationship diagrams and schema, while the remainder of the course covers querying from simple select statements to summary functions, grouping, joins and subqueries. You don't need any particular background to take this course and it could be taken in isolation from the rest of the specialization. Grading is based on 4 week-end multiple-choice quizzes. Weekly course content is divided into several lessons that typically involve watching a short video segment and then working through an exercise set in MySQL or Teradata, two relational databases used in the course. The lecture content is high quality but after the first week, you'll be spending most of your time working on exercises rather than watching videos. In fact, some lessons don't have video lectures at all: the written exercises are really the core of the course. The MySQL exercises are contained in Jupiter notebooks--interactive text and code documents--that let you read instructions and play around with code in the same place. The exercises provide plenty of opportunity to drill SQL queries and build SQL vocabulary. The answers to exercise questions are provided in PDFs (they are ungraded), which means you can skip ahead if you don't need more practice. Considering each week after the first has at least 3 exercises sets plus a quiz, each of which could take a few hours to complete in their entirety, consulting the answer keys frequently is recommended to keep things moving along at a reasonable pace. At the end of each week after the first you'll do a final exercise set using Teradata and answer multiple choice quiz questions based on your results. You use the same real-world data set for each quiz--product information from Dillard's department stores—helping you build some familiarity with the data by the end of the course. The final week of the course doesn't cover any new material: it just contains the final quiz. Managing Big Data with MySQL is a great course for learning practical relational database querying skills with plenty of exercises that let you interact with real-life data sets. The focus on drilling ungraded exercises combined with sparing use of lectures after the first week does, however, make the course feel impersonal. It plays out more like a collection of training materials than the sort of university-style course you may expect from Coursera. I give Managing Big Data with MySQL 4.5 out of 5 stars: Great.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>55</course_id><course_title>Rationing and Allocating Scarce Medical Resources</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>4388</review_data_id><reviewer_name>sam tan</reviewer_name><other_review_count>33</other_review_count><other_course_completed>31</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/samt</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-12-10</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Intriguing course, well-taught by a straight talking professor.

And I really liked developing a custom extension to our project as part of the final assignment. But being part of an intermediate specialization, I though it would be a little bit more advanced. For example, it was unfortunate we didn't talk at all about exception handling. At first, I was a little bit disappointed too as the course focused too much on "drawing with Processing". Maybe a little bit more of interactivity using some standard Java library would have been great. Some students asked about Swing which is (still) commonly found in professional environment. Or JavaFX ? Or even Control5P if the instructors wanted to stay more focused on the Processing ecosystem. Being partly attracted in this specialization by the name of "Google" associated with it, I expected more emphasis on code quality and best practices. I've already mentioned exception handling. But a word about unit testing would have been a great addition too. Finally, I have to mention the audio quality of some videos was poor. "Great sound makes great movies". It is especially important for non-native English speakers. And, speaking for myself, if I turn the subtitles on, I focus too much on them and not enough on what's happening on the screen. Please, don't take me wrong : obviously there are room for improvements, but for a first iteration the instructors did overall a good job. And I would add a special mention for their implication on the forum : I think we've definitively felt part of a "learning community" containing both students and instructors. And that's really an important part of a successful MOOC experience...</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>19349</course_id><course_title>Deciphering Secrets: Unlocking the Manuscripts of Medieval Spain</course_title><school>School:  University of Colorado System</school><review_data_id>114437</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Mark Jackson</reviewer_name><other_review_count>7</other_review_count><other_course_completed>6</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/mark35</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-10-17</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>A slow starter course - the first few weeks cover the history of medieval Europe generally.

I do think it tried to cram a lot into one course, and I frankly forgot a lot of what I had learned. Nonetheless, I am aware of what is possible in R, and it has been a lot easier for me to come back to R when I needed to use it for one of my university courses. Overall, this is a great course to get you started in R, but you need to continue to use R immediately after if you want to retain it well.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50770</course_id><course_title>Building a Data Science Team</course_title><school>School:  Johns Hopkins University</school><review_data_id>117342</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Greg Hamel</reviewer_name><other_review_count>115</other_review_count><other_course_completed>106</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/greghamel</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-01-06</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Building a Data Science Team is the second course in “Executive Data Science” specialization offered by John Hopkins University on Coursera. It is a one-week course that defines the different data science roles in an organization, what to look for in data scientists and strategies for managing and communicating with data scientists. The course has no prerequisites and grading is based on a handful of multiple-choice quizzes. The content in Building a Data Science Team is similar to the first course in the specialization: it is geared toward a non-technical people who have to manage data scientists. The video quality is good and the instructor is personable, easy to understand and knowledgeable. There’s not too much to dislike about this course apart from its brevity. All of the courses in the Executive Data Science track are only a week long, so they can be completed in one or two learning sessions. This is not necessarily a bad thing: I find it refreshing to get a high-level overview of a topic in a short course, but it may not deliver the amount of content that paying students expect. Building a Data Science Team is a good course for what it is: a succinct primer how to assemble and manage a data science team. I give this course 4 out of 5 stars: Very Good.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>198</course_id><course_title>Pre-Calculus</course_title><school>School:  University of California, Irvine</school><review_data_id>4490</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jeff Winchell</reviewer_name><other_review_count>91</other_review_count><other_course_completed>66</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/jeffwinchell1</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-01-27</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>This was a refresher class for me to make sure I didn't miss anything important prior to taking refresher calculus courses.

How do Stars Evolve and Die? What Exists Outside our Galaxy? What is the Fate of the Universe? Although only 4 weeks long, each module covers at least 15 video lectures, so it would take you a whole day to go through that week's lectures. However, since it's self-paced, there's a higher degree of freedom here. The teaching style was nice, and it covers basics of astrobiology, astrophysics and cosmology, and it's somewhere between an introductory course and an intermediate one (the quizzes aren't that easy). Unfortunately, there are no problems or math assignments, but this may be a positive thing for beginners wanting to experience the wonderful world of astronomy. The forums are a bit desolate, but this seems to be an issue with self-paced courses, too bad.

Unless the professor (which was talking obviously to full-time student audience, and didn't make a perspective, that it could be working professionals, who are taking the course), invited guests was focused only on practical implications, thus, I found an answers for some of my questions in their monologues.

I believe the perfect continuation would be a course on robotic spacecraft missions as well. The part 2 of this course has been announced, and a part about spaceflight catastrophes seems to fall in it, which is often referenced in class. The course goes over Soviet and American space expeditions: Vostok, Voshod, Soyuz, Mercury, Gemini, Apollo etc. Its strength lies in great footages, TV streams and interviews. Its flaws are in the fact that course texts are often presented on the slides without any voiceover, and it's difficult to read them. Every lesson is usually a 45-minute lecture, but it's more like a documentary. Technical issues like "pause now and go to quiz 3" should be resolved for the next run, or the videos should be splitted accordingly. The instructor is very active in the forums, but the lectures are more in a video/TV format with various voiceovers, rather than the traditional style. I guess this is an advantage. The instructor has also created Prezis along with PDFs, which is a nice touch, and a good review material. However, this course has gone straight to an on-demand one, and I believe that it could work better in a live session.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50426</course_id><course_title>A Life of Happiness and Fulfillment</course_title><school>School:  Indian School of Business</school><review_data_id>117169</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jñānam Gan</reviewer_name><other_review_count>5</other_review_count><other_course_completed>3</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/jnanam</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-12-29</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>It appears to be a fun personal development course with good use of sound cues, music, instructional video presentation.

I expected the course to be more about ethics and less about long explanations of conditions and their testing. Very often less time was devoted to the ethical issues raised by precision medicine than to the medicine itself. There was also an approach to defining the "ethical issues" that I personally found odd. For example, it was argued that testing for conditions has induced physical problems in some people as one issue of too much testing (even when paid for by health services consumers and not taxpayers); but there was no critical analysis of this assertion. How often does that happen? In 1% of all tests? 0.1%? 0.00001%? And shouldn't the analysis of the acceptability of that risk be left to patients? In this course there's a lot of talk about "risk" but not enough about how relevant those risks are. My personal feeling after taking the course was that, because of the bias towards finding potential risks everywhere, it presented a very grim picture. The last lecture itself is an exercise in futurology arguing that big data is useless - oh, I'm sorry, "raising the issue that there is the risk that efforts towards using big data are inefficient". If you put it like that it's just a risk, right? Yet, like all courses in social science, you need to always hold your defenses up. If you always maintain your alert levels high, you will learn a lot - and this course has a lot on its side. If you hold on to your skeptical instincts, you will end up enjoying it (I know I did, in a way). I do not regret sticking to it when I felt like quitting, because I feel like now I'm much more informed in this subject, whether I agreed or disagreed with the ideas put forth. The workload is quite heavy - seven quizzes and three (!!!) writing assignments. The worst part is that the evaluation system is totally irrational: you can assign a 0, a 5 or a 10 to your peers. Yes, only those three options and nothing in between. I had to give out 10's to almost everybody even though there were significant differences in quality between the essays. And you don't even get the chance to provide feedback to the other student. Overall, I recommend you check it if you have the time. If your interest is ethics, you won't learn anything about it here. If your interest is how precision medicine is seen by social scientists, then this is the course for you.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>28164</course_id><course_title>The Bilingual Brain</course_title><school>School:  University of Houston System</school><review_data_id>70714</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jeff Winchell</reviewer_name><other_review_count>91</other_review_count><other_course_completed>66</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/jeffwinchell1</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-02-15</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>The instructor seems fairly well-informed. However, he is not an engaging presenter (not boring, but not engaging either). The instructor's speaking style is somewhat tedious because he so frequently makes long pauses in the middle of his sentences. You can speed him up to reduce the length of the pauses and hence the videos, but then other parts of his talking will be quite fast. Assessment in this course is very easy and academically a joke. It is not too conducive to encouraging deep, lasting learning. The quizzes, which count for 70% of the grade, are identical copies of the end of video quizzes. The final is a repetition of almost every question in the quizzes in virtually their original sequence (and hence the video quizzes too). You can take all the quizzes AND the final, up to 100 times, the questions don't change with each submission, and they are all multiple choice. So if you don't care about learning and just want to get a certain grade, "multiple guess" is easy. That being said, if you are a parent of bilingual or are thinking of doing so, or you are one yourself, you will find the course interesting (and since there are no other college MOOCs on this subject, this is your only MOOC choice).</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>17356</course_id><course_title>Pensamiento algorítmico</course_title><school>School:  Tecnológico de Monterrey</school><review_data_id>118696</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Julián David Vásquez Gutiérrez</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/julian_david</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-02-21</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Excenlente, este curso te enseña las bases que se necesitan para programar computadores.

The one-week course examines various steps in the data analysis process and contrasts ideal outcomes against the outcomes you are likely to experience in reality. Grading is based upon a few short multiple-choice quizzes. The lecture videos are crisp and the professor does a good job explaining the topics without being overly technical. It does discuss some topics that you won’t fully appreciate without having hand-on experience doing data science projects, but it will help prepare you for some of the problems you might encounter. Like other courses in the Executive Data Science track, there’s not too much to dislike about this course other than its brevity and the limited depth at which topics can be covered in a one-week course. Data Science in Real Life is nice, succinct overview of many of the challenges you are likely to face in data projects and suggestions for overcoming them. It is raises considerations that could be useful for both data analysts and managers. I give Data Science in Real Life 4 out of 5 stars: Very Good.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>464</course_id><course_title>Caries Management by Risk Assessment (CAMBRA)</course_title><school>School:  University of California, San Francisco</school><review_data_id>4410</review_data_id><reviewer_name>sam tan</reviewer_name><other_review_count>33</other_review_count><other_course_completed>31</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/samt</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-12-10</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Even though this MOOC is geared towards the dental health providers, it is still a helpful course for those who want to improve their own dental health and their loved ones.

The first two weeks of the 7-week course discuss classification in general, logistic regression and controlling overfitting with regularization. Weeks 3 and 4 cover decision trees, methods to control overfitting in tree models and handling missing data. Week 5 discusses boosting as an ensemble learning method in the context of decision trees. Weeks 6 and 7 cover precision and recall as alternatives to accuracy for assessing model performance and stochastic gradient ascent to make models scalable. The course builds on the concepts covered in Machine Learning: Regression, so it is highly recommended that you take it first. Assignments use GraphLab, a Python package that requires the 64-bit version of Python 2.7. You can technically complete the course with whatever language and tools you like, but using Python and GraphLab will make your life much easier because the assignments are designed around it. Like the previous course, basic knowledge of Python, derivatives and matrices is recommended, but course doesn't get too deep into math. Grading is based on weekly quizzes and programming assignments. Machine Learning: Classification follows in the footsteps of the regression course, offering a good mix of high quality instructional videos and illustrative programming assignments. Carlos Guestrin takes the reigns in the course (Emily Fox, the professor for the regression course, does not make an appearance) but the presentation format and style are mostly unchanged: videos break topics down into well-organized and digestible 1 to 7 minute chunks. The slides are crisp and generally uncluttered. Some of the most complicated sections are optional, so you can skip them without it affecting your performance on the programming assignments and quizzes. The programming assignments are provided in Jupyter notebooks--interactive text and code documents that run in your browser. They do a good job illustrating the concepts and walking you through the process of implementing machine learning algorithms. Although the course claims that you'll be implementing algorithms yourself from scratch, they provide a ton setup, support and skeleton code: you don't need to define a single function yourself. Instead, you follow along with instructions and fill in key pieces of code in the bodies of certain pre-defined functions to get things working. Essentially every line of code you need to write has a comment giving you the gist of what you are supposed to do. Some may not appreciate this degree of hand-holding, but it keeps the assignments moving along steadily and puts the focus on learning and understanding concepts rather than coding details and debugging. My only major gripe with this course is with some of the decisions concerning which topics to cover. The course mentions random forest models briefly at the end of the section on boosting, but the topic warrants a little more detail. A single 5-8 minute video would have been enough. The course does not mention support vector machines at all. The professor stated in the forums that he may release some videos on SVMs in the future but they were not included at launch since they are more complicated than other models and do not scale well to large datasets. The section on decision trees only discusses missclassification error as a metric for splitting, failing to mention information gain or gini impurity, which are often preferred in practice. Similarly, the boosting section focuses on AdaBoost, while stochastic gradient boosting and xgboost in particular are often more successful in practice. The final week's title "scaling to huge data sets and online learning" is a little misleading because it only really covers stochastic gradient ascent and mini-batch gradient ascent. Machine Learning: Classification is a great first course for learning about classification that benefits from good organization and illustrative programming assignments. The course, does, however eschew some important topics in favor of simplicity; including a few more optional videos covering these topics would give the course the breadth and depth advanced learners desire without harming its accessibility. I give Machine Learning: Classification 4.5 out of 5 stars: Great.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>51723</course_id><course_title>Managing an Agile Team</course_title><school>School:  University of Virginia</school><review_data_id>121153</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Dave Menconi</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>0</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/davemenc%40gmail.com</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-05-16</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Best thing ever: the people who come in and talk about aspects. The very best of the best was the video from Spotify which really showed, in an inspiring way (it's really a recruiting video) what you could do with agile. The instructor does an excellent job of laying out Agile in an organized way and takes a practical, not pedantic approach (which is important because in development you have to be flexible). He speaks well and has organized the course well. No one is going to win oscars for the the little skits ("What's my motivation for that user story!?") but they illustrate the point very well and I give high marks for leaving it all on the field. There were a few quizzes that seemed broken. The first one in the 3rd week seems to disagree with the little explanations (and I know the explanations to be right and the quiz to be wrong) and the 2nd quiz that week says that unit tests help to focus developers on their code (which is on true of test driven development, not unit tests in general) and that test provide documentation (which is true but only if you are very bad at writing the code). But these little quiz problems aside, I both enjoyed the course very much and think I got a lot out of it even though I've read and studied agile extensively.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>27501</course_id><course_title>Probability</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>74439</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Dale anon456</reviewer_name><other_review_count>3</other_review_count><other_course_completed>3</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/anon456</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-05-02</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Excellent 8 week college introductory course to probability, from a mathematics perspective. First edition of the course finished April 2015. The perspective is critical as the course is somewhat more difficult than a course on introductory statistics, requiring the ability to manipulate equations, with just a smidgen of calculus. The instructor is very passionate about the subject and put together an absolutely amazing set of numerous videos, one of the best I have yet seen for MOOCs. The videos included interesting historical references. The videos are somewhat verbose but easily addressed by watching at accelerated speeds. Certificate provided, 65% passing and 90% distinction. Course statistics were provided that showed the average weekly score on the homeworks was ~70%. ~42000 enrolled, but by the end of the course only about 600 students were still submitting homeworks. Discussion forum very active and well supported at the beginning but tailed off as the class participation declined. The instructor was very active throughout. No quizzes or exams or in-video questions or peer assessments, just seven weekly homeworks each consisting of 7-8 multiple choice questions with 2 attempts, solutions provided 24 hours after the 24 hour 50% penalty deadline. I am a well experienced engineer and managed to barely achieve a perfect score, however, there were ~10 problems that I solved by means outside of the course, primarily simulation. Materials released on a weekly basis. In my opinion, the homeworks were short of problems as compared to other MOOCs and the lecture materials usually did not provide more than one example of each concept. A few of the homework problems were ambiguously stated, so the 2nd attempt came in handy. In my opinion, the shortage of worked out examples was the only significant shortcoming of the course. I highly recommend the course and would take it again.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50618</course_id><course_title>The Changing Arctic</course_title><school>School:  National Research Tomsk State University</school><review_data_id>119859</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Kristina Šekrst</reviewer_name><other_review_count>64</other_review_count><other_course_completed>64</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/sekrst</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-03-28</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I really liked this course because it was an introduction I was looking for - an easy overview, but with alarming warnings and educational quality.

Think of this course as a review course and a bit more. Yes, the course does not go into too much detail regarding basic concepts as it assumes that you already have a good knowledge of symbolisation, rules of replacement/inference, proofs, etc. and spends much more time delving into much denser complex concepts that I think aren't typically taught in most "Intro to Logic" courses like Resolution or satisifiability. Tl;DR: This is Logic+. If you already have a good foundation in (formal) logic and high school maths then you will love this. It is a great review resource and gives you a taste of the more mathy side of logic. But you absolutely must have a very strong foundation in logic already.

This course is a series of lecture slides (less than half an hour per week...) with nothing but jargon and practically no examples or training, followed by problems, some of which as absolutely trivial because if you select the correct answer you'll get a check mark, and others are unsolvable by beginners. There is no syllabus ("go check the index of a book", we were told in the forum by a staff member), no information on grading and logistics, nothing. Considering that this course has been offered so many times, and considering that Stanford courses are usually good examples of great MOOCs, I have no idea why this course works so badly every time it opens. Everyone commenting here says the same, and yet there are no changes to the materials and evaluation. I don't think anyone should take this course. The University of Melbourne offers their great two-part course on logic that is one of the best MOOCs ever!

I took this course among several other courses in Statistics and data science. The good things are: \- I like the direct link between the concepts and the applications. Also the concepts aren't advanced, but it truly gave me a very different understanding of statistics in general. On the bad things: \- I really wished the course to be more deeper in the different concepts of statistics. \- The slides are really messy, can't be used for reading or as a reference.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>468</course_id><course_title>Case-Based Introduction to Biostatistics</course_title><school>School:  Johns Hopkins University</school><review_data_id>4514</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Lee Chia</reviewer_name><other_review_count>4</other_review_count><other_course_completed>2</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/leechia</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-12-12</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>The keyword for this course is "Application". This is my first MOOC and the main difference from other courses is there is no detailed notes given. One is expected to have basic knowledge of statistics and is expected to apply what you have learned in a particular scenario.

Blink and you'll see the screen/slide full of doodles. haha. That is what I hate about it. But the instruction/explanation was clear and the cases are intuitive. (smoking). The statistics used can be forgotten easily if you don't practice and write is down. There was one week that I just went straight to the quiz after the lectures without the self-explanation/brain storming of the lecture and I end up almost zeroing the test. Good thing there is a second attempt and I took it slowly. There were exercises before the graded quiz and to be frank the ungraded exercises are harder than the quiz. The quizzes are relatively simple, which is ok because what is important, I guess, is you understand the concept, over sorting the data on paper! (I hate that part too.) Good overall. Could be better.

The 4-week course provides a high-level overview of data visualization, covering topics like human visual perception, basic plotting constructs and design principles, visualizing networks and visualizing databases. The course doesn’t have any particular prerequisites, but knowing how to make plots with some software package or programming language will be helpful for the assignments. Grading is based on two quizzes and two peer-graded visualization projects. The lecture content in Data Visualization is better than the lectures of the previous courses in the data mining specialization. The instructor is easy to understand and there isn’t as much dense technical content to absorb. On the downside, since the course focuses on high-level concepts, you won’t learn how to actually construct your own visualizations. It’s up to you to pick out software and figure out how to make visualizations with it. It would have been preferable for the entire data science specialization to pick a programming language and stick with it throughout to pair concepts with specific implementations and exercises. Data Visualization is a nice introduction to visualization at a high level, but the lack of low-level technical instruction and exercises limits its practical usefulness, especially for students who don’t already know how to create their own visualizations. The course is relatively smooth end to what is otherwise a rocky specialization, but since the content has no real connection to the other courses in the data mining track, you could take it as a standalone course. I give Data Visualization 3 out of 5 stars: Fair.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>28663</course_id><course_title>Text Mining and Analytics</course_title><school>School:  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</school><review_data_id>114071</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Kristina Šekrst</reviewer_name><other_review_count>64</other_review_count><other_course_completed>64</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/sekrst</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-10-08</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I liked the way I could find out about newest algorithms and trends, but I'd like for the ratio of theory and practice to be at least equal, since it's too much focused on the overview of everything there is.

Text Mining builds upon the second course in the specialization, Text Retrieval and Search Engines. Course topics include mining word relations, topic discovery, text clustering, text categorization and sentiment analysis. The course lists programming proficiency (especially in C++) and knowledge of probability and statistics. Keeping with the system established by other data mining specialization track courses, grading is based entirely upon 4 multiple choice quizzes with 10 questions apiece. You only get one attempt at the quizzes. Text Mining and Analytics is information-packed. Each week has 2.5 to 4 hours of lecture content in video segments that generally range from 10 to 20 minutes. The videos quality is satisfactory but the explanations and content on the slides could be a bit clearer. Despite the long videos, there are no comprehension questions or exercises to interact with during or after lecture segments to reinforce learning. By the time you reach the quiz at the end of the unit, you may find yourself having to go back review certain videos to answer the questions. There is an optional programming assignment. Text Mining and Analytics covers many useful data mining topics, but it has too much lackluster video content for its own good. I can’t help but feel like a better course would have been able to condense the videos down to cover the same topics more clearly in half the time, leaving room for more quizzes and exercises. This course could serve as useful as reference material but students watching straight through may find a lot of information going in one ear and out the other. I give Text Mining and Analytics 2.5 out of 5 stars: Mediocre.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>28663</course_id><course_title>Text Mining and Analytics</course_title><school>School:  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</school><review_data_id>110201</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Richard Taylor</reviewer_name><other_review_count>29</other_review_count><other_course_completed>28</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/richardtaylor</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-06-30</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>This course was a major disappointment for me. Everything was bad: content, presentation, evaluation, programming assignments. You name it. I will start with the content of the course. Text Mining is a very exciting area of computer science getting a lot of attention these days, for some reason the algorithms and ideas that are being used today and are the state of the art weren't covered in this course. There's nothing about things such as deep learning, wordvec, glove, recurrent neural networks or LSTM that are the most important tools used today for natural language processing. So I think the content is outdated and I felt I was getting a review of things the instructor likes instead of things really used in the field. Next the presentation: really terrible. The instructor dances around formulas and papers without a single working example to check how things work or any attempt to simplify the topics or explain the most important concepts, just references to papers and reading out loud formulas. The evaluation is also problematic you have only 1 chance at each quiz so effectively you have four exams. This wouldn't be a problem if the lectures contained anything remotely similar to what the quizzes ask. If you are going to give students one attempt at each quiz you need to at least do some examples of excercises in your lectures. The programming assignment was the cherry on the cake, confusing, badly prepared and didn't make any sense. The META system used is really terrible to work with and is a tool that as far as I know is not used at all in the real world. There are plenty of interesting things and tools to use in this area but for some reason META was chosen. I think that was a very bad choice. At the end I completed all quizzes and passsed the course and felt I learned almost nothing and the very few things I remember about the lectures are things that I know won't be useful in the real world. I would have given it 0 stars but I have no such an option.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>28663</course_id><course_title>Text Mining and Analytics</course_title><school>School:  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</school><review_data_id>75733</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Hamideh Iraj</reviewer_name><other_review_count>65</other_review_count><other_course_completed>55</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/hamidehiraj</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-07-08</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>I was very happy when I heard about the course because it was my first MOOC in text-mining.

The lecture component in particular is very good. Prof Kutz is excellent at quickly and clearly explaining concepts and tries hard to be entertaining (often successfully!). The major weaknesses of the class are the frequent errata in the programming assignment graders and a complete absence of any staff attention. The assignment errata are particularly frustrating because your program gets three attempts at a pass/fail evaluation based on a single numeric output, accurate to, for example, 5 decimal places. If you get a "fail", then you have very little information to go on. Is there a subtle error in your program, or was the answer key created using bad rounding, etc.? It is frequently enough the latter to where you are never quite sure where the problem lies. Fortunately, generations of prior students have catalogued most of the errata on the wiki, which is a fantastic help once you discover it. But it's unfortunate that these errors have persisted so long and that the course seems to be running on autopilot, with the staff oblivious to issues that could have been fixed by now. The University of Washington does advertise a paid version of the same class where you have access to course staff, additional materials and some form of certification for completing the course, but given the current state of the free version, I'm skeptical that it would be worth spending the money on. Regardless, I'm grateful that the class exists and think it's worth signing up for if you want to learn the material.

The lecture notes are good, but need to be expanded with more examples. I found the quizzes were too terse - not enough explanation of the question for me. The only assistance is from a forum, but the lack of actual assigned TA's like I've had at paid online classes means that you can't really post/ask detailed questions about quizzes or homework, showing your work, without jeopardizing the post being deleted for academic violation. This is a major drawback to a free class, and one of the reasons I dropped the class. I'd rather pay and get some assistance when I get stuck on a question, so I can move forward. The pre-reqs listed were Linear Algebra, but the course focuses mainly on ODEs and PDEs, - I have much more exposure to the former, which meant I had to review ODE's quickly the first week. The course had problems with many browsers - Google Chrome seemed to be the only choice. I came into the course as a software engineer already with Matlab experience. I believe we all need to get away from the Fortran-ish naming conventions still used in scientific programing - single letters for variables. We should name variables with longer names to help the poor soul who picks up our code a year later and tries to fix it or enhance it. It would be great if teacher's and book writers using matlab would start to move towards more modern styles. I dropped the course as it was taking me more time than I had. I think one needs to have ODE PDE in their back pocket prior to starting this course, and the lack of TAs kept me stuck a few times.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>95</course_id><course_title>Scientific Computing</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>761</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Sai</reviewer_name><other_review_count>13</other_review_count><other_course_completed>13</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/sai</reviewer_url><review_date>2012-12-26</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>This course goes through the whole basics of scientific computing, starting with ODE, PDE (wave equation, diffusion equation, etc.), various methods for solving Ax=b, then FFT, Chebychev transform, and finally finite element method. The professor highly recommends getting MATLAB and in the lecture, uses some functions that are not available in Octave. The lecture videos (except for brief opening videos for each week) were from the recordings of his actual course at U of W and about 20-30% are devoted to hands-on demo of MATLAB sessions. (After watching all the lectures, I feel like getting MATLAB is not a bad idea because its IDE is much better than Octave, which essentially has no IDE. It seems Coursera "students" are eligible to purchase a student version.) Professor Kutz is a very humorous guy, making funny remarks all the time, and I have never got bored. His approach to scientific computing is not to devise all the tools by yourself but to take advantage of whatever available to you and concentrate on solving problems. He not only covered the basic theories but also gave practical advice in using various tools and methods. Thanks to him, I did not lose sight of the big picture without being buried in formulae and algorithms. Like other U of W courses, this course does not offer certificate.

The first problem and the reason I dropped is that what you learn in the lectures is not enough to do the homework assignments, and that's totally frustrating. I believe easier exercises with nicer examples that can be done based on what is learned in the lectures would fix this course. The second problem is the boring way the lectures are given without any interesting examples or motivation, just a readout of formulas and theorems without any story between them. Formula 2.3, then 2.4 then theorem 2.5 etc etc. I would have loved this to be a nice class but it fails.

Required a huge commitment of time and attention, and in most cases, the lectures had to be complemented by self- study, both from the recommended textbook as well as from other, more basic texts. The professor was mathematically sound, but did not do enough to motivate the subject. I think most students who took the course dropped out. What I liked was that the course covered a great deal of information in a mathematically very rigorous way. Even if I had dropped out halfway, I would have learned more from the course than from a typical undergrad course in Information Theory.

This course aimed to provide the technical background as to how this technology works for those not in the industry. It suceeded admirably in this aim. It examines the workings of commercial nuclear power generation and safety issues with a look the supporting physics, a background to radiation and ends with an overview of other civilian applications of the use of nuclear science It does not require extensive maths, physics nor chemistry, scientifically interested 15-16 year olds will be able to take this successfully. Anyone who has a college level science, engineering or maths background will have no difficulties Dr Foulke delivers the content in a passionate, approachable style. The administration of the course (forums quizzes etc.) was mainly done by a support team from Pitt. This was the first running of this course and there were some glitches in the questions, the course staff tried to fix the problems in situ and added an additional optional exam at the end allowing those affected to recover. On the second running of this course should go fine.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>160</course_id><course_title>A Look at Nuclear Science and Technology</course_title><school>School:  University of Pittsburgh</school><review_data_id>2961</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Markus Weber</reviewer_name><other_review_count>5</other_review_count><other_course_completed>4</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/marwebe</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-08-17</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>The course itself was rather interesting. It could have even been a really great course if it wouldn't have been for these two serious issues: (1) The course was extremely biased pro-nuclear, pro-hormesis. There is no danger, sleep well, all is safe. If they wouldn't have been so overly partial about it, I might have believed them. (2) It was too easy, but not just because of the lectures, but also because once a few students were in trouble, the parameters were changed. Some students signed up late? No problem, let's postpone the deadlines. Students had problems with a question? No problem, absolutely everyone gets a point for that question. Students had too low scores? No problem, we just add an optional exam to boost scores for whoever needs it (best thing: if you score low, it won't be counted!). And so on... The grading was largely a farce. Sadly, that made the course totally frustrating for those who took it seriously.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>344</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Psychology as a Science</course_title><school>School:  Georgia Institute of Technology</school><review_data_id>30548</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Dana Taylor</reviewer_name><other_review_count>4</other_review_count><other_course_completed>4</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/danataylor</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-04-29</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>I had little previous experience with the subject matter, and the materials on offer gave a good overview of the subject.

The accompanying interactive textbook could have been the saving grace of this course, however it includes many errors throughout, and contradictory information. The weekly modules contained a lot of working with the textbook, and were not very engaging. It was almost as though I had bought a textbook and worked through it on my own without much guidance or added information.

After I finished I got the same impression as when I finish a 10-minute workout session - good, but tomorrow I won't feel any pain in my muscles.

Most MOOCs are generally stupidly easy, so to me that is a plus. I guess some people just want certificates and don't really consider the quality of the learning materials to rate courses. Don't get me wrong. This course is extremely hard, mostly because there isn't much of a link between videos and exercises - videos are mostly theoretical, exercises are mostly numerical applications of the theory. But that only makes it fun. I never spent more than 2 hours per week and I completed the exam in less than one hour (without recurring to any external study elements), and yet I managed to get a passing grade. So it is a lie that you need an overwhelming amount of time investment to finish the course. And in any case difficult does not mean bad. The lectures are extraordinary - clear yet complex, challenging but rewarding. All professors are great. You will learn more in these 4 weeks than in the entirety of 99% of "easy" MOOCs even if you fail to get the certificate. If you're interested in the topics covered here (social choice, mechanism deign, auctions) or in game theory in general, please do not get scared of dramatic warnings of "difficulty". Be sure that those who like easiness are mostly about getting a certificate. If you simply want to learn more in this area, go for it, you will not regret it.

The videos gave virtually no examples and used lots of terminology with the tacit assumption that you either already knew the terms or virtually immediately understood them when they first sort-of explained them. Unlike in their original version of the Game Theory I class I took, the professors were absent from this class. It was run on autopilot. This class is a disaster. One student persevered, chasing down other texts to figure out how to do well in the class. He got 100% on every test but one (getting a 99%) but it took him 50 hours a week to do this. The professors need to redo this course from scratch. They are excellent in their fields, so I have no doubt they can. Until you hear if they have rewritten the course, DO NOT take it. Wait until they fix it or try to find some other source for this learning. Update: The above review was of the 2nd iteration of this course, run in early 2014.

The first week introduces Science - Technology (S-T;) paths, the second week Research - Development (R-D;) processes, and the third ISs. The course begins with a historical look at things, then moves closer to contemporary studies of government policies, firms, and economies, and how all these things are interrelated with ISs and China. It's a short course, 3-weeks. However, material is dense. I feel it should have been expanded to at least a 5-week course. The course rests of three, short peer review assignments. I would have liked some quizzes too, because without them I don't feel like I was really challenged to understand the material as much as I would have liked (or been expected) to. The videos usually include one in-video quiz question at the end. But let me reemphasize that: one question...for an entire video. It's not adequate. Esp. for an entire 25-30 minute video where half-a-dozen new concepts or ideas are introduced. However, most bothersome is that the lecture notes are BEHIND the lecturer. Accompanied with the fact that the lecturer is always moving around, often you can't even see the lecture notes! How could they make such a blunder?! Here's to hoping that they fix this major oversight in the follow-up courses. Another problem is the audio. It's not normalized. So when the lecturer tilts his head to look at his iPad his voice becomes dramatically louder as it gets closer to his shirt mic. You have been warned. Finally, thelectureroftenspeakstooquickly. I hope he slows down a bit for his audience. There seem to be parts II and III of this course coming up. We'll have to see how those go.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>225</course_id><course_title>The Camera Never Lies</course_title><school>School:  University of London</school><review_data_id>110751</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-07-31</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>I almost dropped the course after viewing the first week section. Already disappointed and discouraged, I grudgingly proceeded to view some of the other videos. I harbored the hope that at least one original thought would eventually surface. I eagerly anticipated the section about Soviet propaganda posters, in hope that with such a vivid subject the lecturer could not possibly deliver dull results. I was wrong. That section in particular caused me to lose all will to continue the course and withdraw. Being a Russian national born in the Soviet Union, I'd been excited to get an opportunity of an outside view, a foreign perspective of the posters' art and some reflection of the shiver inducing cold-hearted practice of brushing of the historical Stalin's disagreeables. Sadly, all I got was the habitual lecturer's routine of retelling the book written by the photographer/researcher, who had actually done an excellent job. By the way, the abbreviation “CCCP” reads as “SSSR”, not as “SiSiiPi”. In order to keep my good faith in all rational in this world I can only assume that the lecturer joked about the pronunciation, assuming that MOOC participants, a potentially multi-thousand auditorium, were well aware how the abbreviation of USSR in Cyrillic is pronounced: [SSSR]. There is one good thing about this course – the subjects that it covers. I don't say "themes" because the thought- and discussion-provoking themes as such are absent in the videos, or it could be said that there is only one recurrent theme: "in our days photography plays an important role". It doesn't require much discussion or thought: in the 21t century nobody really needs a university professor to grasp that concept, it's integrated in our lives, almost an instinct. I admit that the list of events and notorious images, put together by Prof. Emmet, is noteworthy and I suggest to download the curriculum and to give it a closer inspection. To my great sorrow, in all other aspects this course is plainly weak: the absence of reflection, the video editing, the ridiculous practice of not showing the photos that are being discussed due to the copyright restrictions, or showing even those that are not copyrighted on an iPad and from an awkward camera angle... With all due respect, professor Emmet an the filming crew, are you kidding me? You recur to this in a digital age, when anybody can whip up a PowerPoint presentation in 5 minutes?.. At one instance the lecturer apologizes that the presented copy of a photo is too dark to really see anything, but if you squint just like that you could probably get the point... I was tempted to call it quits at that, but my curiosity about the section that covers Soviet propaganda posters took over. The focus of the course is supposedly on images in context, and basing on my own uni experience I naively supposed that it would involve a lot of really eye-opening thoughts on analyzing the images from different perspectives, on teaching people to find a deeper meaning in a seemingly innocuous photo. That didn't happen. The typical "lecture" went like this: the presenter shows an image (and sometimes he doesn't), describes what happens on the photo and concludes with the concept that images really do have significant impact or can be "controversial". That's it. No deeper analysis, no mention of how this fits/doesn't fit with the tradition, no hint of a direction that a student should take to arrive to some conclusion of his/her own, no deeper thoughts from the lecturer. Sometimes the lecturer simply retells what is written in a book of a famous photographer, offering no personal insight. The lecture about "Black Hawk Down" literally consists of retelling the events of the battle and the subsequent work of the war journalist who covered the events. You will gain a better account of this tragic occurrence by reading a Wikipedia article than listening to those 15 minutes of stuttering, badly rehearsed speech. And what does it have to do with the role of images?.. Talk Long, my dear fellow Coursera students, so please bear with a conclusion that is also long: - On the afterthought, having witnessed the results, the fact that a historian made a series of lectures about images strikes me as a bit bizarre. Why would one want to dabble in the outside of one's professional field and offer the online audience an inadequate learning experience is beyond me. - Overall, not much of an effort was put into making the course. I apologize in advance in case there was any original, groundbreaking input from Prof. Emmet in the lectures that I didn't watch, but the reason I quit was partly because I got a strong impression there wasn't going to be any. On one of the several Coursera review websites I've seen a comment describing this course as a "university level" one. Believe me, it isn't. It's a decent listing of curious photos. - The lecturer can't boast deep knowledge about the subjects he brings up, which, I must say, doesn't help his academic credibility. Not to be accused of an empty claim, I have to note that my judgment is based on the Soviet propaganda posters section. Any member of Russian intelligentsia of Soviet times, or even a humanities student educated in Russian Federation (since 1991), whether h/she is a philologist, a historian, or an art researcher, including people from my 20+ generation, could offer a much more thorough explanation of the posters than Prof. Emmet, who contended himself with describing in what Wikipedia calls "Basic English" the images that the students could clearly see for themselves (for once). - The lecturer has awful presentation skills. I understand that not every university professor should or could be a great orator, I've met some humanities' researches who wrote brilliant monographs but were rendered mush-mouthed at the lectures, but damn! This is a flapping MOOC! The lecturer's incessant stumbling on long words, irritating bouts of repetition and low content to speech ratio could all be smoothed over with a proper filming and editing! - BAD editing. Have I mentioned that yet? - The choice of the copyrighted photos that couldn't be shown feels like a disrespect to the student and was one of the things that led to my decision to leave the course. Aren't online, free of charge MOOCs supposed to be accessible to the largest possible number of people, including those who can't afford higher education? Bringing the light of knowledge to all who long for it? Not showing the images: a) is a sign of lazy preparation: other significant images could've been picked for the course, there's no lack of them; b) undermines the glorious concept of free education that MOOCs are all about. In this course the dialogue with the student could be translated as: "I'll tell you a few words about how important this image is, but you still need to buy/rent the book or go to the library to look at it. Oh, the libraries in Ghana don't have the book? Well... you still get what I'm trying to say, right?" - No original insight form Prof. Emmet, he simply retells somebody else's work. I'm obviously very disappointed. More so because I had great expectations of this course (the curriculum was captivating) I would not recommend this to anyone. I'm sure that somewhere out there lurk the courses about art and photography, about the magic and power of a camera shot, created by people who are not only enthusiastic, but also truly professional, courses where the images are treated with attention and understanding that they deserve. And if there aren't any yet, you'd be better off reading a book on the subject of visual arts than wasting time on this course.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>225</course_id><course_title>The Camera Never Lies</course_title><school>School:  University of London</school><review_data_id>3218</review_data_id><reviewer_name>K Brown</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/kb</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-09-11</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Some in the class seemed to take real issue with the structure as compared to other MOOCs, but I learned a lot from the lectures. Each week centered around a different historic event and the coverage it received by the media and how this shaped our perception of said events. He uses both photography and video to make his case, along with a solid grounding in the history of each event. As a photographer, I found it fascinating to know just how many images are manipulated in context or physically altered to deliver propaganda messages. The assignment structure was one of the main reasons I finished the course, there was flexibility in doing most of the quizzes, just get them done by the end of the course period. This helped me a lot, as one of the main problems I have in completing courses is ill fitting time requirements that interfere with life outside of "school". The instructor made some adjustments during the course in response to user comments, so I'd imagine next offering will only get better. Would recommend it to anyone looking to learn more about mass media.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>395</course_id><course_title>Live!:  A History of Art for Artists, Animators and Gamers</course_title><school>School:  California Institute of the Arts</school><review_data_id>30532</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Fernando Fragoso F.F.</reviewer_name><other_review_count>7</other_review_count><other_course_completed>7</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/fernandofragoso</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-04-29</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>It's a nice introduction to history of art, presented in chronological order.

As such, the accompaniment of FutureLearn's MOOC on Archaeology of Portus and EdX's ChinaX mini-course series offered a lot of context, as the three areas were connected by trade around 49 C.E. My only issue was that Professor Lacovara seemed so nervous when he was reading the scripted lessons. However, this was not enough to take away from the material being learned about the conflicts faced by Nubia over time and the eventual fall of the empire. The videos were accompanied by the script for each week in PDF, but there are some visuals used in the videos that make them the primary focus of study. Students will not only learn about the changes in Nubian society over the various eras, but will also gain some insight into archaeological practice over time.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>12676</course_id><course_title>The Art and Archaeology of Ancient Nubia</course_title><school>School:  Emory University</school><review_data_id>43589</review_data_id><reviewer_name>BJ</reviewer_name><other_review_count>6</other_review_count><other_course_completed>6</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/bj</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-07-28</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>Archeology is a relatively new subject to me and I found this an intriguing opportunity to visit something other than an Egyptian subject.

However, this is primarily a data analysis course, so if you're after depth in neural science, you might look elsewhere. I have a strong background in computer science, so it is difficult for me to gauge this, but I suspect that, despite the whirlwind tour of python in the first week, some familiarity with basic programming control structures would make the course more enjoyable, even if it was only at the level of say Code Academy. I enjoyed the material on python libraries numpy, matplotlib and pandas. The assessed work includes four auto-graded programming assignments and associated multi-choice quizzes, and a final project. Each assignment focuses on specific analyses of specific data sets. The data sets are interesting, but there's no cohesive overview of common approaches and the areas they're best applied to. This would be a four star review if not for the autograder. On a couple of assignments, my code worked flawlessly (and without overfitting) on all the practice datasets, but a couple of the grader tests failed without any response beyond "fail". With no further information to be wrung out of the system, and not willing to waste time with endless rounds of outguess-the- grader, for the first time in my MOOC career I had to just write a few marks off. (By way of comparison, I'm simultaneously taking Pavel Pevzner's brilliant Bioinformatics Algorithms I . It too gives a binary success/fail response on "code challenge" submissions, but in this case it is always very clear what is being tested, and there's never yet been a time where my code produced the correct output on the practice data sets but failed to on the test one. I'm running at full marks.) Each assignment also has a peer assessed portion, but these simply check that data plots match a detailed rubric, and there's a minimum of subjectivity involved. Only the other hand, the project is worth 40% of the final grade, is largely self-directed, and entirely peer assessed. If this is not your cup of tea or you don't feel taking your chances with which peer your work is assigned to, this may not be the best course for you.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50873</course_id><course_title>Regression Modeling in Practice</course_title><school>School:  Wesleyan University</school><review_data_id>116758</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Hamideh Iraj</reviewer_name><other_review_count>65</other_review_count><other_course_completed>55</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/hamidehiraj</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-03-13</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>This course is a high-level introduction to linear and logistic regression modeling using SAS and python.

There are good bits about this course, but you can probably read about those in other reviews. I'll focus on the bad bits. First of all, it does not make sense to follow this kind of quality course after the high quality courses "Data Analysis and Statistical Inference" on coursera and MIT's "Introduction to Probability" on Edx which cover similar topics, but in much greater depth and with much more rigour. I'm sure Boris Mirkin is very knowledgeable, but i.m.h.o. he lacks the educational skills. Sometimes the language he uses gets in the way. At other times he explains bits left and right without a clear route of understanding things with increasing complexity. There are times he does not explain why certain concepts exist or how they are used. The slides often contain too much text, numbers and formula's to be clear and informative. I found I had a better understanding when I skipped his lectures and went straight to wikipedia or some other resource. Because of that, it irritated me that he used terms and definitions in a unique ways, so that I couldn't use wikipedia or online searches to study. If I look up Quetelet Index, all I get are references to BMI (Body Mass Index), but Boris uses that term for a general statistic. Another example is the use of "odds-ratio" that differs from its official definition. The programming assignments are quite easy. You can use any language or tool you like. You download a dataset and upload the answer within 5 minutes. When the answer is incorrect, you can download a new dataset and repeat until correct. The environment works. It's a bit specific about white space and punctuation. I do like the idea, but I would prefer to download from within the program using some API as some other programming courses offer. The quizzes are so so. You are asked to show you've understood the definitions and to calculate certain statistics. When doing the peer assessments, make sure to read the grading criteria, because the question does not always comply with them. I did the first run so there is room for improvement. Still I believe there are better ways to learn about the topics that are covered by this course.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>6</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50728</course_id><course_title>Tibetan Buddhist Meditation and the Modern World: Lesser Vehicle</course_title><school>School:  University of Virginia</school><review_data_id>117168</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jñānam Gan</reviewer_name><other_review_count>5</other_review_count><other_course_completed>3</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/jnanam</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-12-29</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>The MOOC does not take advantage of the video format, and certainly does not take advantage of the so-called socially constructed pedagogy learning method, or a panel discussion delivery method. (Instead, it relies only on the traditional hub-and-spoke didactic lecture format.) The content may just as well be delivered as audio only. The presentation seems good, and it is fine for in-person teaching and lecture halls. But attention spans of an Internet audience on the Web platform are expected to be fleeting. (Anything is one mouse click away.) In addition, the subject choice falls within a very specialized area - Tibetology. On auditing the course, I do not think that I could get a handle on it. The course itself seems to wind aimlessly with no narrative structure, and no clear sections to find the answers. In terms of value for money, I prefer video that are spliced with video clips, and video presentation that has a video narrative. (Take some Film Studies!) Maybe this course was intended to be used in a flipped classroom. It is not effective as an online course. Because the information is rather dense, I would prefer to read a book. The MOOC format is only for small bites of knowledge, or so-called fragmented information.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50884</course_id><course_title>Foundations of strategic business analytics</course_title><school>School:  ESSEC Business School</school><review_data_id>117339</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Greg Hamel</reviewer_name><other_review_count>115</other_review_count><other_course_completed>106</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/greghamel</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-01-06</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>Foundations of Strategic Business Analytics is the first course in the “Strategic Business Analytics Specialization” offered by ESSEC business school on Coursera. The 4-week course covers data analysis topics including clustering, exploring relationships between variables, forecasting and communicating results. All discussion is geared toward a business context, so the focus is on producing clear, actionable insight instead of looking at low-level details. The course uses the R programming language for analysis; basic familiarity with R is assumed. Grading is based on 3 quizzes and a peer-graded assignment. Each week consists of two main content sections: a lecture section that introduces concepts and data analysis techniques and then a recital section that teaches you how to use the methods discussed in lecture in R. The lecture videos themselves are polished with nice text graphics. The lecturer’s English takes a little time to get used to, but he speaks clearly and he does a good job framing each topic in the context of business. The programming recitals are easy to follow and let you get some hands-on experience with lecture topics right away. Foundations of Strategic Business Analytics is a nice introduction to thinking about data analytics in a business setting, but it is too short. Follow-up courses will hopefully let you dig your teeth deeper into the material. Also note that the specialization is listed as “Advanced”, but this course is not very technical and only really requires basic R knowledge as a prerequisite. I give Foundations of Strategic Business Analytics 3 out of 5 stars: Okay.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50896</course_id><course_title>Responsive Website Tutorial and Examples</course_title><school>School:  University of London</school><review_data_id>117453</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jeanne Boyarsky</reviewer_name><other_review_count>33</other_review_count><other_course_completed>29</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/boyarsky</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-01-10</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>I like the idea of the course. To talk through some actual examples and have students extend two of them. Why so low? 1) The forums were VERY quiet. One of the high points for me of taking a MOOC is interacting with the other students 2) The instructor/TA weren't in the forum much either. When someone had a question, the TA would say (sometimes the day before the assignment was due) that he/she would ask the instructor. But then we never heard back and the problems/queries didn't get resolved. 3) The "peer grading" procedure was to upload a very large zip file and run other student's. I didn't do this was I was concerned about security. I deployed mine to meteor's website and had my peers grade that. Which worked fine, but most people didn't do that. Another student and I both raised the issues with the "upload a zip file" system and the course staff didn't address it. I look the inaugural version of this course so this problem might get better over time.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>121</course_id><course_title>Planet Earth...and You!</course_title><school>School:  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</school><review_data_id>116093</review_data_id><reviewer_name/><other_review_count>3</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/knfuchss</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-11-25</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>Could be an excellent course: The topics covered in the videos are very interesting. The videos are of good quality, making the material accessible for interested amateurs without cutting too many corners. There is a rich mix of assignments: quizzes about the lectures, assignments to explore your own environment from the perspective of the teachings of this class, and labs to get some insight into the practical work of a scientist in the field. - This course could have a straight 5.0 rating, if the labs, quizzes and assignments weren't so buggy, and what is probably even more bothering, if the instructors showed any interest to address the issues. In the first run of this course, students and teaching assistants have eagerly tried to find the errors in the material and suggest solutions, just to see the second run start again with the same and new bugs (in the case the material had been so buggy it had to be replaced by a completely new version), with apparently no testing done before it was released in the new session. Also, instead of showing gratefulness for good suggestions, the instructors and/or university shut down efforts of students collaborating on collecting class notes, and slammed students with the honor code if they discussed solutions of wrongly graded assignments. Moreover, the grading in this class is rather dissatisfactory, "fixing" bugs (i.e., correct answers graded as wrong) by giving ample make-up options for easy extra credit instead of a real solution, and giving lots of credit "for free" (e.g., by having weekly "assignments" that just ask students to enter some numbers at will that are not verified or used for anything constructive in the course - the most plausible explanation seems to me that they are used for "data mining" for internal use by the instructors, though none of this is proven). So a grade of 100% is nothing you can pat yourself on the back for hard work, but just means that you picked up all the little grains thrown to you as compensation after you didn't manage to get full credit for correct answers on the main assignments. - So even if the instructors may be great lecturers, their apparent lack of interest and respect for students leaves a stale taste.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>51407</course_id><course_title>The Rooseveltian Century</course_title><school>School:  Universiteit Leiden</school><review_data_id>119312</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Hamideh Iraj</reviewer_name><other_review_count>65</other_review_count><other_course_completed>55</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/hamidehiraj</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-03-13</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>I audited this course.

The course, however, has two fatal flaws. First, the lectures are a bit disjointed. While there is much to learn in the lectures, the lecturers style is a bit halting and scattered (it would have been much better presented if the lecturer had a script to read off of.) As is, the lectures are mediocre, which is unfortunate since the lecturer is clearly knowledgeable about the topics presented. Second, the assignments suffer from a lack of good error messaging and no support in the forums (aside from what you will find from other students, which can be very helpful at times.) The assignments themselves are a great approach to learning concepts (and you get to work with real data, like the Twitter data), but without good error messaging when you submit a script you pretty much end guessing where you are taking a wrong turn. I had high hopes for this course, but it seems as though it fails on execution.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>3362</course_id><course_title>Major Depression in the Population: A Public Health Approach</course_title><school>School:  Johns Hopkins University</school><review_data_id>4574</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-12-16</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>I have worked in health care (family medicine) for 25 years.

The one-week course discusses the process of data analysis at a high level from formulating questions to exploratory analysis, inference, modeling and communicating results. Grading is based on several short comprehension quizzes. The lectures in Managing Data Analysis are of good quality and the instructor is generally easy to understand. The lectures do, however, use some jargon and concepts that aren’t always adequately explained. Unlike the first two courses of the specialization, which are geared toward managers, this course is more geared toward people who are actually going to be conducting data analysis. The concepts in this course are definitely important for data science managers to understand, but non-technical students may find this to be a jarring change of pace. In addition, certain parts may be confusing if you have had no prior exposure to statistics or machine learning other than the first two courses of this specialization. Managing Data Analysis provides a useful overview of the process of data analysis, but it is taught at a level appropriate for data analysts. “The Data Analysis Process” would be a more appropriate name for this course. I give Managing Data Analysis 3.5 out of 5 stars: Good.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50477</course_id><course_title>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</course_title><school>School:  The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</school><review_data_id>117216</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Nick Papasavvas</reviewer_name><other_review_count>2</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/nikospapasavvas</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-01-01</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>This is a good short introductory course that assumes you have some experience with HTML and CSS.

Taking into account, that she's leading 2 weeks out of 4, it's pretty empty. The part of DeRue is better, but still not very strong, and the only piece, which deliver something really useful is the part of Sych (as usual).

I found myself doing things on other tabs on the last two weeks because she couldn't keep my attention. I do know that these are videos and not actual interactions but she was repetitive, dull and the productions generally needs work to keep attention since the object being taught is really self explanatory. Which brings me to my next point. The class in itself offers some good advice but it's not something you will miss out on. In my opinion, give it a go.

This short 4-week, self-paced course introduces the concept of business metrics and the role they play in business analytics. It also spends some time discussing the various data-centric roles at different types of companies. The course has no prerequisites and grading is based on 3 multiple-choice quizzes and a final case-study assignment. The lecture content in Business Metrics is crisp and the lecturer is easy to understand. There are only 3 short weeks of lecture content as the final week is devoted to the case study. The peer-graded case study assignment involves identifying and explaining a business metric in a fictitious business. The course explains several common business metrics in detail but doesn’t send as much time on how to use metrics to formulate questions, inform analysis or make decisions. Hopefully these are topics that will be covered in more detail in some of the upcoming courses in the specialization Business Metrics for Data-Driven Companies is a good overview of business metrics and business data culture. As the first part of a larger specialization, it concludes before you get to use the metrics you learn about in any sort of analysis. The value of this course will ultimately depend upon whether the follow up courses make good use of the foundation it lays. As a standalone course, I give Business Metrics for Data-Driven Companies 3.5 out of 5 stars: Good.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>240</course_id><course_title>Surviving Disruptive Technologies</course_title><school>School:  University of Maryland, College Park</school><review_data_id>61132</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Adtya Agrwal</reviewer_name><other_review_count>8</other_review_count><other_course_completed>8</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/adtyaagrwal</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-12-07</review_date><review_value>3</review_value><review>I liked the instructor but there is serious issue with the content of the course.

A range of technologies (e.g. Hangouts, discussion forums, video lectures) were used to attempt to connect with students. However, the emergence of MOOCs has created serious questions about quality, and, for example, how the experience develops deep learning in students and how we can know the extent of that deep learning. Specifically, how can the assessment be designed in very large enrolment courses to ensure validity (e.g. face, construct and predictive) and reliability (e.g. inter-rater reliability) involving a diverse range for students assessing each other's Mid Term and Final Term Projects. Having been both an assessor and having been assessed, this is the worst example of assessment design and implementation in relation to validity and reliability that I have ever seen in my 7 years of primary schooling, 5 years of secondary schooling, and 16 years of tertiary study in 4 tertiary institutions. Standards were not made clear, there were no strategies for moderation, and there was no review of grade or appeals process.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>3</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>246</course_id><course_title>General Game Playing</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>28499</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Dmitriy Borisenkov</reviewer_name><other_review_count>4</other_review_count><other_course_completed>3</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/dmitriyborisenkov1</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-04-09</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>I have MS in computer science, but AI wasn't my specialization.

The videos didn't add that much over the written material, and the written material may need some smoothing, but overall it's good. A few of the exercises were ill-conceived as even following instruction could result in a low grade, but this was only the first course iteration and all the other exercises were useful. The staff also seemed receptive to criticism and willing to further improve it. You can complete the class with or without programming, but for it to be a good experience I think you need to write your code. They offered a gamer framework in Java that could be expanded and resulted in many people writing their own players. I'm a programmer, but didn't know much about Java (but know C# which has many similarities) before this class and found it easy enough to implement a player once the first step of orienting oneself within the framework and where to find the various tools. They pointed to Eclipse as the IDE and I was quite pleased with it, except for code profiling I could do everything from the IDE and it even offered to-the- point suggestions to fix errors due to my lack of familiarity with Java. The 'logic' part of the class was a bit hard due to nomenclature, but looking at the game definitions and the examples in the notes cleared it up. A couple of things that I thought were weird about GGP: 1) all good implementations seem to use a coding approach called 'propnets' (similar to a digital circuit implemented in software that represents the game rules) that is only hinted at in class and requires much work without guidance if you aim at an efficient implementation. 2) some of the games seem specifically tailored to be exploitable (e.g. factorizable games) by algorithms that I guess may be of interest to the authors of the discipline or of those games but I still don't know how much of those methods translate to 'traditional' games. At the end of class the staff organized a competition, it was good fun. Writing a player to participate in the competition should be easy enough, but writing one that is not hopelessly dumb in all games is actually a LOT of implementation work beyond what was covered in class. Overall, I wrote a (general) game player (although its level of play is still medium-poor) as a result of this class, which is something I always wanted to try but never found the time before. I might even continue to improve it for months or years. General game programming has many similarities (e.g game trees, alpha-beta search, transposition tables) but also some differences with programming for a specific games. One difference is the performance hit of having to interpret the rules, but an even bigger difference is that you can't pre-build an euristic to evaluate game tree nodes (it was interesting to see how Monte Carlo tree search can partially address this).</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>246</course_id><course_title>General Game Playing</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>4862</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Duncan Murray</reviewer_name><other_review_count>25</other_review_count><other_course_completed>24</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/duncanmurray</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-01-16</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>I had no experience with Game Theory, but some exposure to AI and software development in general.

I learned far more in that class than this one. The videos were terrible, the instructor was rarely on the screen, and it seemed like she was just reading from a script. The mispronunciations and start overs should have been edited out (and seriously how does someone with a PhD in a subject have trouble with so many words?) The monotone speech could be sold as a cure for insomnia. If you dedicate your career to something you should have some excitement! Also it seemed like as the course went on, there was less content each week. The lectures went down to one segment, and were barely a table of contents to the reading we already did. I did get a lot from the readings up to the last week which was just a wiki link. Rather than powerpoints of the information during the lectures toward the end it was random clip art. Mind Maps work for somethings - but the m ind map project was ridiculous. There was no way to keep it from being cluttered if you added any depth - and realistically you could just modify the sample based on how much of it we had done to that point. I used bubble.us to do mine, and if it were an actual brainstorming project, I could retract unnecessary "baby" bubbles to declutter and focus on the current important bubbles - but can't save that to jpeg, and allow a viewer to reopen them - so I had to leave them open to save - adding more clutter. I was very disappointed in the quality of this course, especially as it deteriorated as the course went on,</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>2</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>218</course_id><course_title>Fundamentals of Human Nutrition</course_title><school>School:  University of Florida</school><review_data_id>1438</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Kelebek</reviewer_name><other_review_count>15</other_review_count><other_course_completed>13</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/kelebek</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-05-02</review_date><review_value>1</review_value><review>I dropped out of this course the second week due to the lack of organization and communication by the team. The online text was poor quality and the reading assignment didn't seem to match the lesson? When I got to the quiz, nothing that I'd read in the text was on the quiz. Thankfully I have some background in nutrition so it wasn't difficult to finish and pass but I felt sorry for those who were taking this class to actually learn the subject. This is one of the worst courses I have ever taken through Coursera. I think the team had good intentions, and the world of MOOCs is new territory, but the lack of flexibility and quick thinking on the part of the team once the course started really lost my respect for the team and the University of Florida.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>218</course_id><course_title>Fundamentals of Human Nutrition</course_title><school>School:  University of Florida</school><review_data_id>1368</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Danny Cinnamon</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/danielcanella</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-04-21</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>This course was very good in terms of content, but poor in terms of presentation. Video lectures were informative but painful to get through. Readings were very informative and not too bad. As a reference for difficulty, I am a high school student and I learned about 50-60% of the course material in a Biology class in sophomore year. The mind map project was to my mind pretty useless and more like busy work than a learning aid. Overall the course was quite informative and helpful but somewhat boring. In addition, after completion it took I think two weeks for the professor to send out completion certificates, with no other contact or conclusion of any kind. It seemed that she may have had some personal issues that prevented her from completing the course properly.

It was interesting to see what others wrote. There was also a "final project" which was vague enough to be anything. The course was fine.

There's so much wrong with this course that I'm just going to give a list. *Videos not edited properly, outtakes left in. *Videos artificially 12-15 minutes each, whether they need to be or not. *No lecture slides, in-video slides, graphics or any learning tools what-so-ever *No in-video quizzes *No video subtitles *No video lengths *Videos in the wrong order *Poor, muffled audio *Worst speaking professor I've ever heard. speaksinonelongcontinuousmanner that makes it incredible difficult to stay focused or parse ideas in lectures. Uses "ummm" and other sound effect frequently to string sentences together. Has an incredibly dry and flat speech vocalization. Doesn't matter how interesting the material may sound on paper, it's delivered horribly in voice. *No peer review assignments *No final *Quiz contains only five of the least critical and basic questions you can imagine. *Students have no opportunity to critically test their understanding of the material. *Opens up his first lecture by saying how it won't measure up to an offline course. This gives you a clear impression exactly how this course is going to go (and it does go). *Staff replies became increasingly sparse as the course went on. No replies to the fact that no one was receiving their certificates over a month after the course had finished. *Course was delayed almost a year to 'get stuff ready for the Coursera platform,' and this is what is produced.

It's a blessing to be able to attend these courses, no matter the problems, and we should be grateful to.professors and staff. But that does not exonerate course organizers from their responsibility of offering something decent - at least cover the basics like make the audio audible. This is the worst course I've taken so far in terms of organization and must be completely re-done if it is ever offered again. The whole experience was a mess. There were sound issues (which were "resolved" and actually sound quality just got worse), the subtitles didn't work either (they were our last resort, and even those were not synchronized), the quizzes were terrible with a terrible grading system (it shows an X when you haven't selected an option that shouldn't be selected, meaning you got it right), there was an amazing lack of communication, especially after a while, and so on and so on. This is all basic stuff. The sound issue is particularly serious because it was IMPOSSIBLE to understand the lectures. Everyone complained after week 1 - I want to believe they shot everything before they noticed the sound issue, and then just didn't want to go back and shoot it again. This seems highly unethical, to be honest. Why didn't they just tape it again? The segments weren't that long, and if they just re-read the transcript from the previous takes it would be literally less than one hour of work per week! The only conclusion is that the staff didn't care. No wonder they kicked it off in week 1 by downgrading their own course - saying it will never compare to on-campus education. If you already start from that premise, the rest of the disaster is no surprise. It was a shame - very interesting topic by a professor who I'm sure is very knowledgeable, and has a very good career in the area. Too bad most of the time I was unable to hear a single word he said. It's also a shame that after a while there were no meaningful staff replies to any of our complaints. It just looked like everyone gave up on this course while it was happening. Now you tell me - without wanting to sound entitled, is this even ethical? Sometimes course staff seem to forget that we are also using our time to attend and appreciate their work, and learn from it. If a lecturer ignores us in mid-session, that is just disrespectful. I stuck with the course until the last week because I've been waiting for things to get better. Now I feel insulted, I feel like an idiot for doing so. I feel like I've been wasting my time. Don't make the same mistake I did.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>54</course_id><course_title>Neuroethics</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>4636</review_data_id><reviewer_name>vaggelas</reviewer_name><other_review_count>28</other_review_count><other_course_completed>26</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/vaggelas</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-12-22</review_date><review_value>5</review_value><review>This course is an example that a very good subject and a very good professor don't necessary make a good Mooc Course. I took the Fall 2013 session and i really struggled to keep up to the course,not because of the difficulty but mostly because of the many problems. I believe that when a university want to provide a Mooc in the public for whatever reasons it has,it must provide all the resources and the team needed to the professor so this Mooc would be an great advertisement to the Uni.Moocs are very different from in Uni Courses for a lot of reasons,and right now there is a lot of competition out there. I really hope that this Course has a new total new offering in the future. My 5 rating is only because of the professor cause i am always grateful to the Professors for the time they dedicate to provide something free,cause as a Mooc production even 1 would be very generous. What i Liked : \- Professor seems very knowledgable \- The subject What i didn't Like: \- Video quality was bad \- Sound quality was poor and level was low,in the first videos you can barely listen eventhough i have big speakers \- Video lectures were long \- The due dates changed a few times during the course. \- Lectures were recorded in an office,which always is a bad choice for Moocs.White screens or black screens with graphics are always better. \- Some lectures were out of order In conclusion,as a Mooc production one of the worst Moocs i have taken(in the fall 2013 offering)</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>54</course_id><course_title>Neuroethics</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>4363</review_data_id><reviewer_name>sam tan</reviewer_name><other_review_count>33</other_review_count><other_course_completed>31</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/samt</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-12-10</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>First the pluses - Prof. Moreno is more than well versed in his field and he provided a fairly quick overview of many provocative issues that are current being grappled within the field. The material delivered in a simple series of lectures from his office will leave you a tad uneasy and that's a good thing. The minus - The course was basically hobbled by poor sound quality. I hung on to the end because the content of the lectures were truly fascinating. Hopefully if it runs again that would improve vastly. It would have been better if the slide content were to be incorporated into the video lectures themselves.

Probably the choice of the framework, i.e., rails is the one to blame for this. rails has code-generators and does many automatically with some commands in the command-line so it is very difficult to know the "under the hood" operations. If you are a very self- learning person and just need to register course(s) to act as some dead-line manager then you might take this course. Otherwise, there is absolutely nothing I gained by going through the videos and completing the quizzes and programming assignments in this course. Talking about programming assignments, they are the most embarrassing part of this course. The prof. has videos of exactly what you need to type and stuff in the form of "The blog application - Iterations". There are totally 5 iterations and just mere imitation of these videos will be the 5 programming assignments.... see, there is not a bit of scope for thought or challenge. I absolutely hate this course, worst of all my MOOCs</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>194</course_id><course_title>Science from Superheroes to Global Warming</course_title><school>School:  University of California, Irvine</school><review_data_id>3082</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Ramiro Aznar</reviewer_name><other_review_count>27</other_review_count><other_course_completed>26</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/ramiroaznar1</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-07-16</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>"Science" was my first MOOC taken from Coursera and I can say that I have a very good time.

As another said, the videos are simply horrible quality audio recordings of an actual class. with a simple slideshow rewriting stuff along to the audio. I tried to give it a chance, as I was very interested in the course material, but I just could not get through even 1 week of the lecture videos. I have no doubt that this is an awesome course to have taken in person, but this format and quality is just unacceptable as a class offering for coursera, and I'm surprised Coursera ok's something like this.

The videos are slapped together from previous courses the professor had pre-recorded, with little 'pop-ups' to adjust them for the Coursera course. Furthermore, those videos are only a whiteboard with no visual interest whatsoever. The audio quality is poor- one can hear students coughing and shuffling in the background, and the professor's voice is hard to follow at times. The only reason I give this course one instead of zero stars is that the free textbook they provide is well organized and interesting. I will save myself the trouble of taking this slapped together poorly designed course and just read the book on my own.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>3</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>194</course_id><course_title>Science from Superheroes to Global Warming</course_title><school>School:  University of California, Irvine</school><review_data_id>948</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Eric G</reviewer_name><other_review_count>3</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/Codechopper</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-04-02</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>I'm enjoying this course much more than the "stare at a professor talking" offerings around many MOOCs. It's enjoyable to hear the professor in a real- world setting giving his lecture in a real classroom (complete with ambient sounds). This gives me the impression that this is "real world" and not just made for the web. The content is easy to follow and presented well. The first peer assessment was a lot of fun to complete and didn't take much time at all. I managed to complete it in one afternoon, and parsed the data the next day. I'm really enjoying this class and am looking forward to each new week. My only real issue is the same I have for all Coursera and edX courses...TERRIBLE discussion forums.

There is lot's of discussion (I'm told) in at least 3 places -- the Coursera discussion forum (which was excellent, but little used compared to 2 or more alternative discussion sites the instructor set up -- a twitter @ site and a twitter # site) -- but I was never able to find all the discussions, even with some direction from the instructor.

If you want to teach such a controversial subject, you're bound to run into hot topics. The lecturer is really quite good and engaging, and he does a very competent job at maintaining your attention throughout. You will definitely learn something new about the nature of the relationship between religious institutions. As a course, it is very light. The exercises are quite easy, virtually impossible to get wrong (two attempts at questions with only two possible answers). However, this course left me very uncomfortable at moments (and others too, judging by reactions in discussion boards). It presents a very light take on the relationship between the christian church and jewish populations. It highlights the centuries of relatively peaceful coexistence, punctuated by brutal episodes that it mostly ascribes to issues of state and power and not necessarily religious intolerance. That is definitely true - the rise of modern states, and their appropriation of religious excuses, caused more bloodshed than religious institutions by themselves. But very often you're left with a sour taste in your mouth, because the tone of the lectures is very close to whitewashing of atrocities committed by religion in the name of religion. By highlighting mostly the good and doing an apology of the bad, the overall historical picture gets very biased. Imagine the following analogy: Charles Manson spent most minutes of his life without committing murders. In fact, he was only in the act of committing murders during, at most, a few minutes of his entire lifetime. If you write a biography of Manson framed in this way, you're bound to say that for the most part he was a pretty peaceful guy. I cannot shake the feeling that that's what the course does with the history of the Church in what relates to other creeds. In any case, controversy is good - so if you're interested in this topics you should take the course. Roman catholics will obviously be very interested in it, since it gives them a lot of ammo to respond to some atheists' arguments about religion being a force for evil in the World.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>48</course_id><course_title>Experimental Genome Science</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>31856</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Mbwana Samatta</reviewer_name><other_review_count>5</other_review_count><other_course_completed>5</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/mbwanasamatta</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-05-26</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>With my master's in molecular biology I was hoping to get an upgrade on genomics and genetics with this course.

Actually the test taking process makes it too easy to get 100% for a course from Coursera offered by a decently ranked university. The technology presented by the teacher is old hat for the typical person who keeps up with popular internet sites. I would prefer if the teacher was more knowledgeable. It is not taught by a professor or even someone with a PhD and her lack of detailed info shows. That being said, there are a number of resources pointed out by the instructor that MAY prove to be valuable. If evaluating those proves to be fruitful and if you spend time for the peer reviewed assignment to do quality work, the class may be worth it. I was very disappointed to see that the peer review assignment had no space to provide comments. The instructor is in charge of all MOOC offerings from her university and claims to have overseen 14 MOOCs so far. The quality level in her MOOC (and another one I took and dropped) suggests that her management and teaching skills need a lot of work for someone at a good university. If it weren't for my good experience with the university's pre- calculus class, I would be tempted to stay away from all Univ of California- Irvine MOOC offerings. As it is, I will be wary when I take another one from them. There is an advanced class from the same university starting in January 2014. Hopefully that one will be more worthwhile.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50476</course_id><course_title>Machine Learning With Big Data</course_title><school>School:  University of California, San Diego</school><review_data_id>118706</review_data_id><reviewer_name/><other_review_count>5</other_review_count><other_course_completed>4</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/kingstonn</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-02-21</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>this is the fourth module in the Big Data Specialisation.

If you take a course in such a narrow professional sphere, you expect to have at least a couple of real-life tools to use, when you finish the course. But unfortunately, this course is too narrow, with too shallow material, and too obvious conclusions, which instructors tried to sell to student, as a practical tool. Also, the delivery of the materials was questionable. One of the instructors (Ilya Breiman) was not bad, but the other (Alexey Dolinskiy) was talking too fast with a nasal voice, as if he's constantly in a hurry, and a lot of things was simply hard to understand from the first time listening.

La corrección, al ser texto con tus ideas, se hace entre iguales (peer assessment): fue un desastre porque la misma gente que no se molestaba en hacer los ejercicios no se molestaba en corregir los de otros... acabamos autocalificándonos en un 50%. La soluciones consistían sólo en enumerar las ideas principales. Pocos días después de la finalización del curso, sin aviso previo, desapareció por completo: material, vídeos, foro de discusión, ejercicios propios y soluciones... No sé si es algo habitual en Coursera (no he repetido) pero sigue pareciéndome inaudito. En general la experiencia me recuerda más a algunos profesores mediocres que tuve en la Universidad española, que a los cursos impecables que he hecho en edX o Udacity (sobre informática, electrónica y aerodinámica que, he de admitir, son materias que me atraen bastante más). Pese a lo dicho, terminé el curso porque sólo duró 6 semanas, y aprendí alguna cosa que puede que me sea útil, sobre todo en los vídeos de los "artistas invitados".</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>28802</course_id><course_title>Human-Computer Interaction Design</course_title><school>School:  University of California, San Diego</school><review_data_id>117900</review_data_id><reviewer_name/><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/stenseven</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-01-25</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>This is a very interesting subject, but unfortunately it is presented in an uninteresting way. The instructor, Scott Klemmer, is dull as dishwater. He reminded me of the kids in college who never shut up. The content is rather disjointed and the assignments don't apply fully to the lessons. For instance, the first assignment is about interviewing and using the information to determine how a user relates to a process. The assignment requires an interview, but there is no next step, to extract the information. It's just an interview, which does require skill, but why not use the opportunity to go through the next steps? Also, considering that this is a course about Human-Computer Interaction Design, I was surprised at how badly the Coursera platform was utilized to submit the assignments. For instance, the storyboarding assignment required the upload of a JPG or GIF file that was nearly illegible when reviewing because it was reduced to such a small size. Why not at least display the file at full size, or include a lightbox feature? I get the impression that Coursera is now letting anyone teach anything, and is not reviewing the quality of the courses before making them available. This course is part of a 12 month Interaction Design Specialization, but after completing this first unit I have zero incentive to continue. There are plenty of other ways to learn this material.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50577</course_id><course_title>Foundations of Objective-C App Development</course_title><school>School:  University of California, Irvine</school><review_data_id>117029</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-12-23</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>Don Patterson is a professor of Computer Science at UC Irvine, so there can be no doubt that he knows his stuff, CS-wise, but he seems completely disoriented trying to explain a rather complex development system to what he appears (at the outset) to assume are complete programming novices -- e.g., explaining the difference between integer and floating point variables and what machine code is. Students will learn how to navigate the Xcode development environment, and how to prepare rudimentary apps by means of a rote-learning approach, perhaps without ever being referred to Apple's Human Interface Guidelines. Human-computer interaction is supposedly one of Patterson's academic specialties as a professor, so it is remarkable that his interaction with the Coursera MOOC building platform is so awkward. I don't know whether this reflects more poorly on Patterson or on Coursera. The course and specialization seem to have been rushed into production a bit. Oddly, the instructors did not bother to include a Discussion forum alongside this course. There may be good reasons for this omission, but if they exist, they are not made clear at the outset. All in all, this may be an opportunity for bright novices to get hooked on Cocoa, iOS, Objective-C and Swift without forking out thousands of bucks for a boot camp at Big Nerd Ranch. But they won't get much farther than the ubiquitous Temperature Converter if they don't also pick up one of Hillegass's (or similar) books to read alongside the MOOC. Ten years of programming experience with X-Code, Objective-C and the Cocoa frameworks have shown me that this cookbook approach will bore the ones who can learn it on their own and will leave the rest struggling to do anything besides copy what they've seen before. Development of a popular app can still happen with a brilliant idea, but reliable success will require exposure to at least the first couple of years of a university computer science curriculum.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50718</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Operations Management</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>119862</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-03-28</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>There were several errors in the videos that had to be corrected in the discussion forums by the TAs. If one didn't read the TAs comments they would have learned the wrong thing and had trouble with the assignments. TA support was spotty at best, many questions go unanswered. The instructor, never visited the Forums and never commented. Other Professors in the Wharton series, DID occasionally visit and comment! At times, Quizzes focus on and test trivial "dimensional analysis" rather than comprehension of the subject matter. Unlike other Wharton Business Specialization courses, there is no reference material. Instructor is German which means a slightly different way of thinking and presenting the subject matter due to cultural differences. (nothing wrong with that) However, if one does not fit with his style, then the only text he references (he wrote) is of little help in elucidating the concepts. Plus, with sparse TA support one is essentially on their own. Certainly would not be left hanging in a bricks - mortar education. Unlike other Coursera courses that recognize learning is often collaborative and shared, none of that was suggested or encouraged. Other Coursera courses on business matters often encourage and develop a learning community through the forums, not here. Finally the content is watered down from prior courses. The philosophy that Wharton appears to have taken is that attention spans are too short for anything over 4-weeks in length, so shortening the course gets and keeps more people in the class and more likely to take the next class. Certainly a push-pull happening here between World Class education and Marketing / Revenues. 3500 students at $95. Hopefully Wharton can improve and adjust?</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50756</course_id><course_title>Engineering Self-Reflection for Human Completion</course_title><school>School:  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology</school><review_data_id>122431</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-07-03</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>Be careful about taking this course!

The style of the professor's presentation is actually engaging. Understand, though, that the class provides no chronological history of China. Someone without an understanding of the basics of modern Chinese history will be lost and should not take the class. Second, the quizzes. There was no feedback. Only the final attempt counted. That would have been fine if the quizzes were clearly worded, or if every quiz actually had one unambiguously correct answer. So far I've taken four quizzes (there is still a final exam that will be released tomorrow), each with three questions. One or two questions on all four quizzes have been deeply flawed. Third, since the beginning of the course, well over a hundred comments have been made complaining about the poor nature of the quizzes. When it came to one question, the professors accepted two right answers. In all other cases, student comments about the confusing nature of the questions were completely ignored. The lack of responsiveness from the professors has been extremely disappointing. In short, I would recommend this course only to people who (A) have a sophisticated understanding of statistics, (B) don't care about earning a certificate, (C) already know a good deal about modern China, and (D) don't mind if questions posed by numerous students in the forums are ignored by the staff and professors. ADDENDUM: I have just seen the final exam for the course. It features 10 questions, all dealing with trivia rather than understanding. And the professors, who have never addressed any of the concerns about the course, just closed down all the forums. This is extremely annoying, given that we were actively told by the professors early on to reach out to classmates in the forums to discuss confusing questions.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>410</course_id><course_title>Early Renaissance Architecture in Italy: from Alberti to Bramante</course_title><school>School:  Sapienza University of Rome</school><review_data_id>51732</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Maryna Lagereva</reviewer_name><other_review_count>5</other_review_count><other_course_completed>4</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/marynalagereva</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-08-19</review_date><review_value>3</review_value><review>I had to drop the course as the speech of the lecturer was awful.

The course itself is very much 'talking head' with slides in the background. The problem is that the lectures are rather poor quality translations of Italian originals, delivered in a strong Italian accent which is sometimes difficult to make out. There are grammatical errors and many, many flaws in idiom. This makes it hard to get to the literal sense of what is being said. There are computerized sub titles which are a mixed blessing and which state 'inaudible' at frequent intervals, including at times when what was said was audible to me. The subject matter itself is easy: it is the language through which it is delivered which makes it difficult. Those whose first language isn't English appear to find it especially difficult. I found the use of the term 'final solution' to describe one feature of design unfortunate. Not only were the associations of this word regrettable but also many students were not certain what it actually meant. I think it meant something like 'decision about what to do in terms of pillars and columns when you get to the end of a wall'. Some students have taken it on themselves to produce written transcripts with illustrations and these are a great help. The quizzes are simple factual ones, and easily answered correctly, especially if tackled with a transcript open while you do them. Spot the doric, ionian, corinthian is a common choice of question. But even in the quizzes the English language is not correct. In one there is an example of subject - verb disagreement. Nothing particularly theoretical or abstract here. The pictures are nice. A mixed blessing: whether I shall complete I don't know. The prof is clearly an acknowledged expert in the field, so I suppose that this course doesn't really do him justice and that is a shame. One noticeable thing and positive thing is the way that the students work together to answer each other's questions. If you want to learn to recognise and name features of Renaissance Architecture and to learn a little about some of the architects of that time, and especially if you intend to visit Florence or to tour Italy, then I think it would be worth having a go at the course. You may be put off by the delivery issues, you may not.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50571</course_id><course_title>Songwriting</course_title><school>School:  Berklee</school><review_data_id>116830</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-12-18</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>I thought this would be a fun course.

Some of the lectures were also rather on the confusing side and a lot of things don't seem to be explained in a way that doesn't make a lot of sense. Like I said earlier the Instructor is entertaining and has an amusing personality. He tries his best to make the class fun and moving forward. I learned a few things a bit more on the technical side of things so at least it wasn't a total bust.

It made my stomach turn. It displays everything that is wrong about social sciences today. I should also say that the materials are all put online in the beginning, so you're able to do the course in one go. I found it challenging but I made a point to finish the course so that I cannot be accused of being uninformed. I finished with more than 95% on the quizzes, so I am not speaking out of spite. I was really excited about this course. "Understanding Video Games", in my view, would be actually about... video games. Their evolution, how they started, why people play them, how they relate to current events and social and artistic movements, etc. Nothing prepared me for what the course is actually about. This course is a shameful display of post-modern relativism. It is built around social theories that interpret and divide video games characteristics, and proceeds to "analyze" (it can hardly be called an analysis) them according to those frameworks. The history and evolution of video games? They take 5 minutes to get it out of the way each lecture. The reasons why people play? Nothing discernible mentioned. How they relate to the rest of the world? Oh, there was quite a lot of that... unfortunately. If you take this course, they will try to "teach" you that the back stories in games are a way to "make arguments". So if in "Civ 3" you sometimes need to go to war instead of always making peace - that's an argument about how the world works. You will "learn" that games that are purely violent, or stereotypical in general, without any context for that violence or stereotype, are just nonsense. You will "learn" that many games are "misogynistic" - and, even more striking, that "gender is a social construction" (sic). You will "learn" that race is always an issue, if for nothing else for its absence - the hero is always a white male heterosexual, after all! And "Star Trek" had you killing Klingons just because they were an alien race, teaching racism to young children! You will learn that the people who made "Medal of Honor" paid more attention to making guns sound authentic than showing the actual horrors of war - the bastards. And, of course, you'll hear about gamification on a slightly scornful tone. If this all seems like utter nonsense to you, then you are not alone. I find it shameful to pass this - which is pure ideology - for knowledge. It is unverifiable theorizing. It is empirically unverifiable. My favorite example was "Street Fighter" as a case of stereotypical racial profiling. Dalshim is Indian, and as such he practices yoga and can bend his limbs. Blanka, you'll be told, is Brazilian, and as such he is a very quick Capoeira fighter. Those racists! How dare you, Capcom? Of course, they forgot to say Dalshim's main feature is that his arms and legs extend. Is that the stereotype of Indians? That their arms extend meters in front of their bodies? And Blanka, his main feature is giving electrical shocks. That's totally stereotypical, right? After playing "Street Fighter, when I was in Brazil I was sooooo afraid to shake people's hands... If you believe the post-modern constructivist credos, you'll love this course. You will probably see the world as a paternalistic, sexist, racist place. Which is sad. If you're a reasonable person, this will all sound astonishingly bad. This course follows that same path, quoting nothing but post-modernist "thinkers" (cough cough). And as such it does the same thing that post- modernist social science does: it proposes basic ideas obscured by made-up technical terms; when you distill those ideas, they are either truisms or absolutely false. Not that those folks will admit to this - after all, if you ask a "video game theorist" about this same review, they will say I "misunderstood" the contents. Of course I did. It's the slippery way those people argue. Their claims are all obscured by their style of dialogue precisely so that it is impossible to pin them to the ground and actually assess the truth or falsity of their claims. Every single way you interpret it is, necessarily, a misinterpretation. And this is a symptom of rotten intellectualism in itself. Saying that "gender is a social construct" is purely false. It's ideology rather than knowledge. Seeing racism in having to kill Klingons is beyond unreasonable. The saddest thing is that a whole course about video games hardly ever says explicitly the main reason why people play games. Because games are f'ing FUN! Sure, games use stereotypes. Sure, princesses are there to be saved. Sure, the body count and sadism in "Manhunt" is high. And that's why we play those games. They allow us space to shed our skin and indulge in pleasures we would not want to in the real world. We get to be someone else. We are in a world of no consequence where we can be as amoral or immoral as we wish. To suggest that those games, the racist, sexist, violent-for-no-reason, stereotypical ones, are plain, boring, dangerous, bad or uninteresting, is simply to miss the point. It is the opposite of understanding video games. It's trying to bend games to the ideology of the interpreter. During the entire lectures you never see even a still picture from any game mentioned. I question why the lecture videos have no images of the video games themselves. I doubt it's a copyright issue, because the games are being used for commentary - at most, the university would need to ask permission. Is it because maybe people would find them fun and want to play the "undesirable" ones? Or is it simply because anyone who saw the actual games would understand that what's being said (again) is either trivially true or completely false (or, at the very least, meaningless)? I always recommend people check out the courses for themselves. You should definitely do the same. But don't take a passive stance. These "theories" in the social sciences have long held back their respective fields. They are relativistic, obscurantist, and just wrong. Applying them to something so free, boundless and fun as video games is sacrilege.

I'm currently half way through the Udacity Android course and I recommend the Udacity course over this one. This course suffers from a fundamentally flawed approach to teaching Android development. It tries to teach Android development through lectures instead of having students write Android applications. While the production quality of these lectures is high, they are nearly useless for learning Android development. Learning to write Android applications is mostly learning the Android API. It is a rich, complex API and just like learning any other API such as JPA, JSF, or Swing you have to write code to learn it. While this course does have programming assignments, Coursera defeats the learning process by distributing Android applications that are more than 90% complete with a few TO DO blocks in them for students fill in with a few lines of code. This approach is useless. What is needed is to have students write entire Android applications. In a MOOC applications from thousands of students could only be graded by an autograder, and this I believe is why Coursera chose to over-emphasize lectures instead. Coursera would not spend the money needed to develop an Android autograder. The Princeton courses on algorithms by professors Sedgewick and Wayne have a very impressive autograder that could serve as a model for Coursera's Android courses. The professors specify an API that the application has to implement and the autograder gives detailed feedback on the implementation. There will be some challenges for an autograder for Android applications. It may not be possible to autograde an app that plays an audio or video file. Someone has to watch and listen to see if it is played correctly. Peer grading would be needed in these cases. Coursera is responsible for this failed approach. During the second course in this specialization (taught by Professor Douglas Schmidt) some of us were lamenting the lack of an autograder. Professor Schmidt responded that there was no way to develop an autograder since they had no budget for the two courses. This course alone provided over $400,000 in revenue to Coursera, but they didn't invest any of it back into the course. Coursera ate all of the seed corn. Professor Porter probably did the best he could with what he had to work with. It is up to Coursera to provide the resources (money) to create the technology needed to teach this course effectively. Startups are supposed to create new technology, not repackage centuries-old techniques and deploy them on the web. Get with it, Coursera.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>3</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>20325</course_id><course_title>Social Entrepreneurship</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>69341</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Jeff Winchell</reviewer_name><other_review_count>91</other_review_count><other_course_completed>66</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/jeffwinchell1</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-01-27</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>This class had much hope, with the promise of select students getting to go to a retreat/mini-incubator. But it was sadly, a waste of time. The practices advocated by the professors may be suitable for Fortune 500 companies doing the same old same old, but not for innovative social entrepreneurs. The only thing differentiating Fortune 500 practices in this course were the things you would do to get rich foundations to give your never-make-a-profit idea money to burn. Notably, there was nothing about testing ideas out on potential customers/creating some sort of mockup/prototype. Silicon Valley would laugh at such a course. At or around the same time there were 3 other Social Entrepreneurship MOOCs (1 on Coursera and 2 on Iversity). All could use a good dose of Silicon Valley realism, but the closest to breaking the decades old business practices was the Social Entrepreneurship MOOC from Copenhagen. As it is being run again in April 2015, I recommend that one over the other 3, but be sure to take Steve Blank's Startup MOOC on Udacity (which is always available) first.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50541</course_id><course_title>Programming and the Web for Beginners</course_title><school>School:  Duke University</school><review_data_id>118640</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-02-19</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>I am taking two different MOOCs in computer science right now: this one and another from a different university.

This course is dry, dull, not challenging in any meaningful way, and often fails to convey memorable information. It's a shame these professors, who have so much to offer, are represented online for so many learners through this course.

No lecture slides provided; 2\. The texts in the videos appear as they were produced online by an old fashioned typewriter; 3\. At most of the times, the instructors read monotonously the texts in the videos (those text looking as been just typed); 4\. Very few examples provided (most of the times, the focus seems to be the memorization of the various acronyms, rather than deeper understanding of the concepts); 5\. The textbook is not available at major stores such as Amazon or Barnes-Noble; (edited by Argos Press, Canberra); 6\. Many bugs with quizzes (including scores that are suddenly reduced, quizzes with many or no correct answers, inconvenient wording, etc). Because 100 atempts were allowed, I took the quizzes some few times until I got full marks. However, because of the bugs, the marks were randomly "reseted" and I had to re-take them to recover them (happened up to 3 times). Some quizzes are quite uninteresting as they concern mostly the memorization of acronyms. 7\. The design for the course pages is not the usual Coursera Standard, requiring familiarization with the modifications for efficient navigation. Overall, I would prefer to reed a good book on the subject (some are freely available, such as the NASA's System Engoneering Handbook).</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>2</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>34333</course_id><course_title>Preparing for the AP* Calculus AB and BC Exams (Part 2 - Integral Calculus)</course_title><school>School:  University of Houston System</school><review_data_id>67418</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Mr. L</reviewer_name><other_review_count>2</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/Leyil</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-01-07</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>The poorest-organized course I have ever taken.

In reality, I'd give it probably .5 or less. Overall, the course was a VERY targeted complex statistics class, where the professor would do 1-2 examples during his video lecture, and then nothing else. NO readings, no practice problems, nothing besides the quiz, which was completely different than the actual examples. In addition, there was very little Excel. We received Excel workbooks pre-populated that could help us solve the problems in the quizzes, but the video instruction did not actually show you how to do this...the professor solved all the problems by hand, thus there was little to no knowledge transfer on how to actually use Excel. Finally, the single TA for the entire class was absent from the discussion board for weeks at a time. Questions literally aged for 5-10 days before being answered. Total waste of time and money. I'm glad this site exists, as Coursera does not have reviews for classes on its site.

If it isn't immediately obvious to you that this class is devoid of original thought after spending 10-25 minutes viewing the first week videos, this review can not help you. It has slick (though not hard to create) production values to make you think you might be getting a quality learning experience. Instead, you learn about what some group trying to standardize what is not academically researched (at least by them)... how learning online approaches can be effective or not. Instead we get banal slides (with "cool" sound effects or background music) that might as well have been: In this course you are going to read * Words * Sentences * Paragraphs * And Sections! And then you get an in-video quiz asking you bullet point words you just saw. In one slide I learned we can read some material about blended and online learning usage outside the US. In a report from 2006!!! How about tell us what happened in the stone age? And here is some groundbreaking information I'm sure every teacher will want to learn from this MOOC (from one of their slides with a happy, vacuous face on it): A teacher INTRODUCES Content ASSESSES Regularly ADJUSTS Instruction FACILITATES Communication and Collaboration PROVIDES Feedback The only thing worse would have been if they had made some absurd acronym out of that slide and tested us on what words made up that acronym. THIS IS AWFUL: No wonder I never heard of Kennesaw State. The UC Irvine education MOOCs have been bad enough. I'm not wasting another minute in this MOOC.

Therefore, some few comments are posted here with a view on contributing to improve future editions of it. 1\. Content: Very interesting and relevant. However, the material is presented in a very superficial way, without details or explanation of the involved physiological phenomena. Not much "whys". 2\. Instructors: This course involves many instructors. Most of then just read the slides and have very strong accent. Sometimes, it is difficult to follow what is being said. 3\. Slides: Mostly bulleted text on white plain background. Very little pictures, diagrams or videos are used. Many acronyms are used without prior definition. Sometimes the slides become cluttered with a large number of latin names of the various protozoans, worms and vectors. 4\. Quizzes: Many questions are repeated, some use confusing wording, some are misplaced and there are too many typos. Some are "trick questions"... 5\. Reading Material: A significant number of text is provided. These are mostly, freely available, but some are not. No handouts are provided. 6\. Video and audio: Mostly OK, but problems such as sudden increase or decrease in the audio volume may occur.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>32026</course_id><course_title>Statistical Reasoning for Public Health 2: Regression Methods</course_title><school>School:  Johns Hopkins University</school><review_data_id>114407</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Ranga Raghunathan</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/rangaraghunathan</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-10-16</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>If you want to learn the intricacies of regression modeling and the concepts involved, do not take this course. The instructor and the course content is so drab and boring that I struggled hard to finish the course. Most of his case examples are screen shots from journals with no effort into making it interesting or intuitive. Statistics can be a wonderful subject when you teach the intuition and idea behind the technique. This course does the opposite. For e.g. His section on propensity scores was so bad due to the fact that he puts in zero effort into explaining the intuition behind using propensity scores in the first place instead of using all the variables as a multiple regression model. He basically reads out the slides aloud and reads out the reserach clippings for examples/case studies.

This course made me understand atleast one thing in great clarity, that I should not waste money on Wharton courses. The amount of effort put into the course material, into the organization and flow of material (or lack thereof), and into the quality of videos and content delivery, would sum up right about to Zero. Needless to say, this review is going to be highly critical, since I expected some value and quality from a school like Wharton. Should you pay $95 for this course. I think they should pay you for wasting your time. The course tries to teach the importance of branding, and customer centricity, and personifies how not to do it. Here are some specific complaints I have with the course, in no particular order. You might not agree with all of them, and some might seem insignificant, but in any case, here they are : 1. Platform : The entire course is just a series of videos, and plenty of them are over 15 minutes long. It's hard to imagine that students would be able to keep their attention, and grasp new and/or tough concepts with such an approach. A combination of text, figures, videos, and interactive exercises would have made it much easier to grasp the material 2. Videos : High school kids can make multimedia of better quality. Videos consist of someone talking for several minutes, with occasional inclusion of presentation slides. Slides are no help either. It seems material is copied out of a text book, then pasted into a slide, and then integrated into a video. And then professor spends a few minutes reading out the text of the slides. The diagrams are lifeless, asymmetrical and does not help advance the understanding. 3. Structure : The order in which videos are presented doesn't make sense. There is no structure to the material which would help you understand the concepts in a logical and progressive manner. Sometimes, the heading of the video does not even seem to match with the content. It feels all videos were filmed in an ad hoc fashion and then just put together in a random order. 4. Discussion Forum is not a great help either. You would want to see more activity and brainstorming there, considering so many students take this course. But, there is no incentive for the students to share ideas and contribute, since passing the course does not depend on discussion forums. When "Mentors" reply to some answers, those answers seemed to be pasted out of a text book. 5. Quiz : In its current structure, there is no point of having a quiz at the end of the week. The goal should be assimilating or internalizing the material and concepts, not just pass the quiz. The course allows you to retake a quiz upto 3 times a week, so you don't really need to go through the videos at all. They don't check if you went through all the videos before taking the quiz. And they don't give you answers and explanation after the quiz is done, since then the students would always score 100% on the second try. If I can not even understand where my understanding lacks and fix it, why am I taking this quiz. 8. Final Exam : You can find answers to most questions by just searching the key phrase in the course material. And they help you in doing that by telling you which Professor's videos you need to search. They don't test you on concepts, they test you whether you can remember what the Professor X meant when he/she made a statement Y. 9. Content Delivery: I found second week to be the best in terms of content delivery, but the rest of the weeks were more or less lacking. The examples or analogies given did not always match the concept introduced. If you read the transcript of the videos, the sentences spoken would not even make much sense. Many times, you can find the professor glancing down, as if looking at the laptop screen besides her, to read out the slides. The professor comes out as nervous and fidgety, which is very distracting, to say the least. If you are still reading this review, I hope you would spend your $95 on a subscription to a business magazine, or may be just on some good food. This course is definitely not worth it, and it 'll cost you more in your precious time.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>12652</course_id><course_title>Основы корпоративных финансов (Fundamentals of Corporate Finance)</course_title><school>School:  Higher School of Economics</school><review_data_id>4709</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Front Crew</reviewer_name><other_review_count>1</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/frontcrew</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-12-30</review_date><review_value>3</review_value><review>I've had some experience in this course before but now I've come to know new things that I wouldn't have learn if hadn't taken the time to do this course.

The textbooks were well chosen (though asking students to purchase three textbooks is, for many, asking a lot financially). But overall the course suffered from various technical problems and lack of engagement on the part of the staff. It would be more honest to call it a self-study rather than a “course.” The technical problems seem to have resulted from a half-hearted effort to turn a live class into an online course. Video segments were missing and had to be requested. Entire lectures were mislabeled. The audio failed frequently, in one case over about 100 consecutive minutes of lecture, resulting in an echoey track that was barely audible and often unintelligible. When the instructor moved away from the screen to write something on the blackboard, the camera typically did not follow, resulting in a comically empty frame until the camera operator finally woke up. The in-lecture questions that appeared on- screen sometimes migrated out of their logical slots and past the credits at the end of a segment. The slides could have benefitted from more dynamic sequences showing movement of data and the like, and where such sequences appeared in lecture, they were not provided in the slide decks. The lectures were generally clear and understandable, if not especially inspiring, and complemented the reading. Some of the slides, however, were clearly taken from a similar course offered at other institutions (and credited as such), and these were poorly explained or glossed over; the lectures suffered here. The problem sets were challenging and broadly covered the lecture topics. Occasionally a problem had no lecture or reading antecedent, perhaps because the topic was covered in a lab that was not part of the online course – again, a deficiency in adapting the live class to an online format. More problematic were the frequent errors in the solutions, some of which were corrected in response to student postings and some of which were not, as well as the paucity of explanation. Disappointingly, the staff answered virtually none of the substantive questions posted to the discussion boards (other than to occasionally confirm the correctness of a student-posted answer). This was surprising given how few questions there actually were throughout the course. In fact, most of the questions arose from the incorrect or inadequately explained solutions to problem sets. Unless the problem itself called for an explanation, the solutions offered none. While bare answers may make sense in advance of a live class to discuss them, obviously there is no such class in an online course; and just as obviously, erroneous solutions never make sense. Exams were challenging but ultimately frustrating and somewhat pointless. It took almost as much time to enter answers into the primitive on-screen template as it did to actually take the exam; line after line of characters had to be entered in a specific font and painstakingly aligned. The grading rubric was difficult to apply and did not cover the range of possible answers. Despite several students’ requests, no statistics were provided, so we had no idea many students took the exams, how well we did relative to our classmates or how our efforts rated objectively. Given the absence of grading statistics, a completion certificate or even acknowledgment of participation in this class, it is difficult to see the value of actually submitting the exam or grading others; since the grading rubric (imperfectly) supplied the answers, why not simply grade yourself? Again, this reflected a lack of staff engagement. Certainly we participants have paid nothing for this course and don’t expect generous outlays of faculty support or time. But many of us did put quite a bit of time into the study of advanced subject matter; it is not unreasonable to expect at least a modicum of attention and feedback from the course staff. One professor offered this explanation of “what’s in it for Princeton” in providing online courses: “With tens of thousands of students completing exercises, there are sure to be lots of interesting stuff to learn and analytics to be done. We can find what errors students are most likely to make and which topics are most troublesome.” I hope that Princeton derived at least some benefit from our collective experience. Princeton’s end of the bargain, in my view, is to provide something more than an open coursewear self-study. In fact, the technical deficiencies in the videos and slide sets, and the inadequate solutions to probem sets, compromised the effectiveness of the course even as a staff-less self-study. Certainly it disappointed as a “class.”</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>12</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>47012</course_id><course_title>Photography: A Victorian Sensation</course_title><school>School:  The University of Edinburgh</school><review_data_id>114650</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2015-10-23</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>More like an old style 'multi-media' Web site than a mooc.

If that is not your case, my opinion may not matter. Also, I only watched the first 2 weeks of lectures (did no homework, since the first one is at the end of week 3). While it deals with a really interesting subject, with sub-exploration in the MOOC space (I believe this is one of the first courses addressing it), I believe there is a poor delivery of the material: this may be harsh, but I felt the lectures where neither challenging enough nor clear enough. Probably the fact that I have had issues listening to the instructor contributed to this feeling (the audio didn't seem very good, it makes focusing hard). Overall, I felt I was learning nothing new, neither revisiting what I already knew; but you experience may differ if you have a different background, I advise to try it for yourself.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>2</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>228</course_id><course_title>Economic Issues, Food &amp; You</course_title><school>School:  University of Florida</school><review_data_id>1821</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2013-05-30</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>The main problem with this course is that it's very poorly organized and worded, and the lectures are just definition lists. Also, the quiz questions are just plagiarized directly from other sources, video lectures are often out-of-synch, and the lectures are flat and sound like someone is just reading directly from a textbook while staring at you on the screen. If this sounds awkward, it was. Many people didn't pass this course because of the often confusing and disorganized instructions and inconsistent assignment listings. Sometimes the assignments would be worded in a way that made them sound optional, when in fact they were not. At other times the assignment list would be missing requirements until you clicked on a downloadable .pdf which listed additional requirements. How confusing! This course also has some of the most writing I've had to do for a non-liberal arts course. Each week there are writing assignments in the form of news summaries, journal entries, and peer commenting; and assuming you correctly follow the writing rubric, then you'll be writing a minimum of 4,500 words. Another problem is that all the conceptual lifting is done by student. The professor only gives you the definition list, then you have to fill in all the gaps yourself. This course could have greatly benefited from case studies aimed at helping the student understand the implications of the definitions. Without this, the ideas in the course usually feel abstracted and without meaningful context. Throughout the course, I couldn't help but feel very sorry for the many international/ESL students who must have been having an even more difficult time than myself. If they made it through the course, then a big congratulations to them.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>2</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>96</course_id><course_title>Information Security and Risk Management in Context</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>58629</review_data_id><reviewer_name>S P</reviewer_name><other_review_count>4</other_review_count><other_course_completed>3</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/sp1</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-10-17</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review/><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>96</course_id><course_title>Information Security and Risk Management in Context</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>7138</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Student</reviewer_name><other_review_count>anonymous</other_review_count><other_course_completed>anonymous</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>null</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-02-27</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>What a pile of garbage.

But there are NO SUCH DISCUSSIONS in the lectures.  The quizzes are just opinion polls that are automatically given full credit as there are no wrong answers.  The second writing assignment grading rubric is guaranteed to give good grades to even the most awful of answers because it only asks if issues were addressed, not if they were addressed well.  At this point in time, I have taken well over 30 MOOCs and this is by far the biggest waste of time of any of them.</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>14150</course_id><course_title>Technology and Ethics</course_title><school>School:  The Ohio State University</school><review_data_id>43597</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Josh C</reviewer_name><other_review_count>3</other_review_count><other_course_completed>2</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/joshc</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-07-28</review_date><review_value>3</review_value><review>I had no prior experience with this subject.

I've taken other Coursera classes and this is the worst I've encountered. Almost complete absence of course instructors or assistants in the discussion forums. Poor preparation of course materials. Incomprehensible quiz questions and answers. Nearly impossible to complete in some cases. As an example, one quiz requires you to derive answers from a dataset in Splunk, but the dataset they expect you to use is UPDATED DAILY (the instructor even states this fact in the lecture). The answers when the quiz was written are no longer the answers you get with the current data, and they don't provide a copy of the dataset used to create the quiz. You must simply guess the quiz answers and repeat the quiz until you guess enough correctly to pass.</review><review_status>null</review_status><helpful_rate>1</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50579</course_id><course_title>Hadoop Platform and Application Framework</course_title><school>School:  University of California, San Diego</school><review_data_id>120727</review_data_id><reviewer_name>Angel T</reviewer_name><other_review_count>3</other_review_count><other_course_completed>1</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/angel16</reviewer_url><review_date>2016-04-28</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>This course offers no more than reading the Hadoop tutorials by yourself.

I liked that the course was coming from a more "sound design" perspective. However, continual mistakes in dates used to open the assignments and the evaluation of assignments (e.g., evaluation periods opened and closed at the same time on the same date) resulted in the course lasting longer than it was supposed to. This was due to how long it took us to get someone to notice the problem and fix it, resulting in backing up the eval dates. In fact, the course went into "Grading in Progress" mode before we had been allowed to evaluate the final assignment. But even more irritating than that was the fact that no one--neither the staff of the school nor the staff of Coursera-- responded to forum posts to let us know what was going on. I have taken numerous MOOC courses and this was, in comparison, very disorganized and unprofessional. I think it has the potential to be a great course, but it needs serious attention. I wouldn't discourage anyone from taking it as long as they understood that they were in for a certain level of frustration and what one might call shabby treatment</review><review_status>Completed</review_status><helpful_rate>0</helpful_rate></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>19166</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Computational Arts: Audio</course_title><school>School:  The State University of New York</school><review_data_id>30624</review_data_id><reviewer_name>i S.</reviewer_name><other_review_count>14</other_review_count><other_course_completed>11</other_course_completed><reviewer_url>/accounts/profile/ivanas</reviewer_url><review_date>2014-05-01</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>I enrolled in this course with the motivation to learn a bit about working in sound editing software, for example audacity or similar free software.

The course was disorganized, students had no idea how to deal with assignments or where to post the finished ones. All course info was scarce, insufficient and confusing to newbies in the field.
