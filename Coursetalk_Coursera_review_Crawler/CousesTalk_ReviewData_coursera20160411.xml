The professors seem to like teaching the class (and really seem to like each other, which come across and actually makes the class even more enjoyable). The lessons and mini projects are perfectly calibrated to be challenging without being impossible -- after the first week I started each homework assignment saying "I DON"T KNOW HOW TO DO THIS!!", but then realized that they did indeed teach us everything we'd need to know to complete the assignment. I think I read there were something like 40,000 students taking the course. How do you grade 40,000 assignments in one week? You provide a very careful rubric and you do peer review. This is actually the toughest part of the class, because your peers are even less forgiving than the professors would be. All in all, I'm glad to be taking this course, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn Python.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>726</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Wonderful experience! I'm impressed so much with both the material and the way this course is organized. Lectures, quizzes and mini-projects were entertaining and challenging. Still, while I was enjoying and having fun, I also learned a lot about the language which was new to me. The professors really love what they do, which is the most important. They put really a lot of work into this course, so that even newcomers could write applications with GUI using some OOP. This is incredible! I'm looking forward to other courses of the professors! It was really a 8-week long holiday to me, despite hard work upon the assignments:)</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>687</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This class makes itself different from others in a few different ways. The class works around an open, friendly, and supportive environment that makes learning easy and welcoming. The professors of the class do a great job of making things interesting and at times very funny, while at the same time walking you through learning to program with Python and teaching you the fundamentals of programming in general. This class is a gem, and something that everyone should take, regardless of their skill level. I've been programming/coding for the past 8 years, and was quite familiar and comfortable with Python before even starting the class. I initially started the class because I liked the way the professors did things, and I thought it would at the least be a fun experience overall. I ended up learning a few things that I didn't even know about Python, as well as alternate ways to do things I already knew of. And this, in my opinion, makes the class priceless and well worth the time I spent on it. I truly have to give my thanks to the professors, to Rice University, and to Coursera. All of you have made a valuable impact of my life that I will keep close for the long run.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>1408</review_data_id><review_date>2013-05-07</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>66 reviews and only one that's below 4 stars, eh? I agree that this class has a lot going for it: the professors are smart, cool guys while also being skilled communicators who explain things well (Mr. Rixner especially -- maybe he should be the sole instructor). Watching the video lectures, almost everything made sense while it was happening, and it encouraged me to press on. But then came the first test and project, which both left me stumped on several points. I ended up spending hours on each, mostly on scanning the forums in the hopes of finding a message thread that would answer my question (I often got lucky eventually, but not always). I'm not sure if it was a matter of being tested on concepts not covered very thoroughly in the lectures, or the class not giving enough practice for the material to absorb properly (there's no homework; maybe it would help?), or whether I'm just slow. In any event, the frustration, coupled with my subsequent inability to meet the deadline, inspired me to drop out. It's strange: I always saw math, logic and analysis as my strong suits. Either I was wrong all along or this course needs tweaking to be more n00b-friendly.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>688</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Very entertaining course.

This was my first course on Coursera and I am very happy with the format and interaction. Having done distance learning and selfstudy courses before I am most impressed with the student to student and student to instructor interaction this adds the missing dimension to distance learning bring it up to the level of being at there. I will be taking other Coursera courses and hope the experience continues. I have used the MIT open course ware and although it's content was good it lacked a fundamental part of the learning process, interaction with other students, instructors and there feedback. This course format gives an experience very close to being in College and thats something that has been lacking in distance learning. So well done Rice, Coursera and everyone involved. Thank you everyone for putting in the time and effort.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>4613</review_data_id><review_date>2013-12-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Overall Assessment: The professors here did a great job of explaining the programming fundamentals, keeping the videos light and MOST IMPORTANTLY showing concern/engaging with the students (Joe Warren actually reviewed my final project in the Code Clinic). Also, I am a huge fan of CodeSkulptor not only because it is a really easy to use this web based program but also because I was able to share my games with friends/family and they were able to play in their browser vs downloading a Python shell. Know Before You Start: (1) Use the Code Clinic early and often. You can waste a lot of time debugging and the TAs/Professors are very responsive and can diagnose issues quickly. (2) Start your mini-projects early. In order to see the solution, I needed to step away from the computer and if you are scrambling before a deadline (projects have a hard deadline of 10pm PT on Saturdays), you will get stressed. Target Audience &amp; Prerequisites: Great class for those with little to no programming background and looking to get hands on experience in coding. Probably couldn't become a developer after this class but definitely would be able to build some cool variations of the mini-game projects. Having some math background is important but if you know how to use Excel then you will do well since Python is very similar to writing Excel formulas (lots of "if" statements) Difficulty: As a novice, I found this course about medium difficulty. Learning how to debug took the most time. That being said, the CodeSkulptor interface is great and the weekly instruction guide for the projects provide a great walkthrough of how to build a game. Weekly Workload: There are about 1.5 - 2 hours of videos to watch, the quizzes take at most 20 mins each but the projects are what were very time consuming. Early projects took about 3 hours to complete but later projects (e.g. Blackjack) were more in the 5 hour range. A great resource that I didn't really use until the end was their Code Clinic where you could send in your program and they will help you debug. Great response time that was typically within 2 hours of sending an email. What Could Be Improved: The peer grading system is good for ensuring completion of assignments but I never received any useful feedback on how to improve my code. The challenge is that when you have to peer grade 5 other assignments then you just don't have time to go through a debug and provide helpful commentary.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>728</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I have no words to describe that fantastic experience that I had in these 2 month. Its the best course ever. I really liked the way it was planned, the short lectures, the humor and atmosphere, and of course it content. I love playing computer games (and playing childhood games like pong and asteroids - own made was even extra fun) and had to learn python for my work, so I got 2 birds in one shot. You guys made these videos, in a way, that I really felt like i'm actually sitting in your class (and even a small one), so even it was hard for me to spend the required time, listening, answering the quizzes and coding the mini-projects, and I'm happy to be able to "return to my wife and kids", I'm going to miss watching your videos. btw, some WERE crazy. Thanks again, for preparing such a well design and warm course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>657</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I already knew a decent amount of Python before this course started which means I didn't learn that much. (list comprehensions were the only thing new.) I signed up because I wanted to see how an intro to programming course could be taught online. I think the professors did a great job. The videos were clearly designed for internet learning and they tried to be fun. The quizzes and homeworks had strong ties to the course. Peer review went better than in some other classes I've taken although I would like to have seen more review of the code and not just the functionality. I liked this discussions held in the forum. I learned about pyUnit (on my own) to make the assignments more challenging - and easier since I had regression tests. Another student did the same so we got to talk about it. The course also held a video contest where the winner got an iPad. I didn't follow along with that during the course, but I think it was a good idea. The course used http://codeskulptor.org as the development environment which introduced consistency and prevented needing to download Python. (I had it already and used my Python for pyUnit.) The browser version didn't work consistently in all browsers. If we are supposed to use Chrome, it would be nice to say that week 1.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>454</review_data_id><review_date>2012-11-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>very well done. starting with specially designed sandbox - http://www.codeskulptor.org/ you have everything to learn the basics of Programming and Python. the learning curve is perfect: from nothing to complex game design in 8 week. requires curiosity, persistence, and sense of humor.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>712</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>A superb introductory course in event driven GUI programming using Python.

Although there were many occasions an which I got lost or confused the both re-watching the video lectures and using the practice exercises / community forums quickly cleared up my confusion and allowed me to finish the weekly assignments. I found the teachers to be entertaining and very instructive, and the community support was amazing. I had posted problems and got a response within minutes. I would highly advise taking this course, even a complete newbie can learn to build some rather creative and fun code, so long as you put in the work.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>34527</review_data_id><review_date>2014-06-02</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This class was a great introduction to Python and interactive programming.

I had taken a few courses at school, but it was mainly theoretical stuff that didn't even scratch the surface of this course. The course starts really easy, but about the mid and on it builds up in difficulty quite abruptly for beginners (it is mentioned that beginners might find it fast-pacing though, so you should just have it in mind). However I didn't follow all the excersises and many times I was running in the last minute to complete mini-projects, so I guess it was my fault too. I definitely learned lots of cool stuff and I now believe that programming is not as difficult as I though it was. It just needs planning and thinking. This course is 100% recommended if you are just getting started! Lots of thanks to everyone who contributed!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>34082</review_data_id><review_date>2014-06-02</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Great professors and materials, the course is very interesting.

The amount of material offered, in term of quizzes, mini-projects and pedagogical tools, is pretty phenomenal for a mooc. This, to me, is what really makes this one stands out : the programming assignement have been much more sophisticated than what I've seen in other MOOCs, even those which were arguably geared toward more advanced students. The same is true of quizzes, which are usually longer, better elaborated and more complex than what I've seen elsewhere. (This is the reason I'm giving this course a "medium" level of difficulty.) Combine this with evident passion on the part of the teachers and a talent for content structuration, and you're pretty close to having a perfect MOOC. I will be joining M. Rixner and Warren on their following course, "Principles of computing".</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>34065</review_data_id><review_date>2014-06-01</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course was great, the professor and the way that they teach us how to programming in Python it is perfect and also an oportunity to a good education.

I'm already a programmer but I wanted to learn Python, as it is one of the core languages used by my employer (Google). The class teaches the basics of the Python language, but what makes the course engaging is that it uses game programming as the basis for homework and project assignments. I didn't know anything about game programming, so I actually learned some interesting things I wasn't expecting to learn. Yes the course is work (don't underestimate the required number of hours to complete the mini-projects), but it turned out to be fun work. I can recommend the class for anyone, at any programming skill level.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>955</review_data_id><review_date>2013-02-20</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course is very useful for Python beginners.

If you are new to programming, don't be afraid, this course is perfect. The pace is just right and the mini-projects (games) at the end of each week have the right level of challenge (and you can share them with your friends by sending the link!).

The other course, from U of Toronto, was narrower in scope with more carefully organized/clear lessons, but this course had much more challenging projects that helped me get the concepts down more effectively. I think they worked very well simultaneously!

The way this course was structured really helped to focus what I was doing. The lectures are not only very informative, but a lot of fun as well, and I will certainly miss watching them each week. The course is a combination of lectures, quizzes and mini-projects. There is a logical progression to the teaching and how to implement the mini-projects introducing you to many aspects of Python. By using games as your mini-projects and coding in a browser, you can easily share your programs with friends and family, I found this incredibly fun as they not only bug tested, but also gave me many ideas of new things to implement, leading me to experiment with my coding. The buzz you get on completing something that initially seems quite daunting, but when broken down into small steps is very manageable, is truly incredible. I will actually really miss this feeling as the course has now come to an end.

It provided useful information from the professors and students and fostered a community feel for the class and allowed more advanced students to mentor beginners, providing an engaging experience across skill levels. Only bad thing about the class is that it ended without a Part II to follow-up.

The quizzes seemed to be a layer of learning for me, because I could retake them up to 5 times to continue to improve. I learned a lot from doing quizzes.

Turns out this course has been extremely instrumental in making me fall in love with programming; I found that through this fun class (both in the way it was taught and the programmes we had to make), I was willing to struggle and push myself, and gained huge satisfaction in the end. The instructors were awesome in making this class accessible and I would like to thank them for all the effort. Highly recommend this course to everyone, and I'll be moving on to other courses under them as well.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>119726</review_data_id><review_date>2016-03-24</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Course content: python is modern language in demand and the form it's been taught is marvelous.

For reference I had completed Calculus in college ( about 10 years ago), but had no prior programming experience. I am a biologist, but did not have any issues with grasping the materials. The instructors were entertaining and engaging. I was a little irritated with the university when the course prices jumped from $49/session to $79/session with no warning, so beware of unannounced cost increases! This did not affect my current enrollments, but did make it much more of a financial challenge to continue taking courses from the university.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>119718</review_data_id><review_date>2016-03-23</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Very good course for anyone looking for a taste of what programming is about. The content has been carefully created to give a thorough introduction of python, and in no time, they get you going doing some very interesting projects. The feeling of succeeding at a mini-project and showing it to your friends afterwards is highly rewarding. For the instructors I have nothing but praise. Both prof. Scott Rixner and prof. Joe Warren excel at making the whole process both useful as a learning exercise and engaging. They skilfully delve into the more difficult concepts and to soon after, jump-start the student with a fun exercise to put those concepts into use. Regarding coursera, while flawless in computers, it is a pain to use in Android or iOS in the iPad. Whole sections will not load (such as the mini project pages), a change in the screen orientation (in Android) will refresh the app to the landing page.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>119716</review_data_id><review_date>2016-03-23</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Outstanding course - the best Coursera course I've taken.

If you are wanting to learn only the core features of Python, you may get frustrated with all of the time spent on game-related topics. However, even though I felt that way at first, I thoroughly enjoyed the course. The sense of satisfaction gained from completing the weekly mini-projects is great. The course material itself is challenging, as is the course structure. This isn't a course you can spend a few hours a week on and expect to be successful; it requires some investment. Having attended Rice University in person for my undergraduate degree, I know the level of quality expected of the students and the courses, and this MOOC follows in those footsteps. The class material and instruction are top-notch, but a certain level of dedication will be required to finish the course successfully. But if you enjoy a challenge, you'll be glad you did. As far as the provider, Coursera is reasonably good, but I don't have much to compare it to right now. It does seem lately that they keep making changes that benefit their profit line rather than their students, however. In spite of increasing prices and other similar issues, I hope people will still take this class. I think it is well worth the effort.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>119672</review_data_id><review_date>2016-03-22</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I am not a game-boy, but the games do provide a nice way for interactive programming.

I'd recommend this to anyone interested in learning python.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>119596</review_data_id><review_date>2016-03-21</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course content is great.

I don't even a word of Python before the start but completed the course without problems. Instructors are very, very good. Keep us motivated, good help, funny jokes, I'm really sad now the course is over because I was enjoying a lot. Coursera is a good course provider, but now has changed the policies and you can do the tests and mini-projects only in paid mode. Those are really bad news for all who have money enough to spend on it.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>119594</review_data_id><review_date>2016-03-21</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>CodeSkulptor is the real game-changer in this course.

What differentiates this class from other python programming MOOCS is the use of Codeskulpter and the pedagogical decision to use games as a motivation for learning to program. Codeskupter is a web-based python programming environment the eliminates the need for newbies to find the best and latest python installation. Using video game development as a motivation makes learning about lists, tuples, sets, timers, etc. much more interesting.

Not only did I learn a lot from the course but it is now my favourite coding language and am eagerly looking for Python projects. I can't recommend this course enough. The only criticism I have is the penalty for late submissions. 1 minute late, you lose 50% of the grade, other courses on coursera I am doing do 10% per day late, which to me with a full time job, 3 hours of commuting a day and studying three courses seemed fairer.

I am 66, began programming in Basic at Dartmouth in 1967, continued on learning Cobol and Fortran for business (with punch cards) and finished up at Harvard with Pascal. I haven't worked in what we called MIS since 1987, so while I knew of object-oriented programming, I never quite understood how or why one would use it. I also had no real interest in gaming. A young college graduate friend toying with idea of game development as a career asked me my advice. I suggested that I would find an online course and we would take it together and he could find out if it was something that might work for him. He dropped out after part 1 ( he had a life), but I was hooked and continued. Far and away the most organized class I have ever taken. The lectures, quizzes and mini-projects built on one another beautifully. Everything was there to complete the projects---and on several occasions I even went to the forum for some hints. Not as much fun as helping a young woman after class at a coffee house, but more effective. In particular, your roadmaps for attacking the mini-projects were invaluable. I couldn't have completed the projects without them. Also, telling us which data structure to use saved a lot of time and pain. Those decisions are often more important than the actual programming. I admit, I probably spent about 15 hours a week on the course, and without the lure of a grade or a paycheck, it was sometimes challenging. But I am terribly pleased and impressed with my final project. I wish I had friends that would appreciate what I have done. I even wish they had a follow up course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>117142</review_data_id><review_date>2015-12-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>It is a very good and fun class with a nice teaching style.

I would of preferred to use the python program instead of using codeskulptor because i have got used to it and now I would need to learn different names of the modules instead of simplegui. The course is really enjoyable , the videos are really good and the instructors (Joe and Scott) are really good teachers and they are funny. They sometimes play games with each other it is enjoyable to watch. The mini projects are good however there is only week to submit which doesn't feel like a long time because I had to watch all the videos first to try to understand it and there are quizzes that need to be completed too within the same week ( it is a lot to do).

You can really tell the instructors have spent a tremendous amount of time and effort in putting together the course material and refining it over time. The instructional videos are put together well with a good sense of humor keeping you engaged, fully preparing you for the quizzes and mini-projects. I took this class as it is a part of a learning curriculum from my employer along with Part 2. I've been so impressed with the instructors that I've already signed up for the follow-up classes 'Principles of Computing' even though it's not a required course for me. I know I'm going to learn and these guys do an excellent job in teaching.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>117116</review_data_id><review_date>2015-12-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>A top class MOOC to learn programming interactive games using python.

I love you! It was great to learn from these great teachers, just a dream. My mistake is that I signed up for training, with a low level of English proficiency. Zero programming knowledge, by contrast, does not prevent - the explanation is very affordable and simple. Russian subtitles were not in every video - and therefore had to translate English subtitles through Google Translate and revise :) twice. But increased their English) At the end of the course was very complicated, time to complete assignments missed. But I'm glad I tried.

This time before clicking on stars besides, I started to think about my expectations and what this course, material, instructors or environment could give me more. I soon realized that "none" was the true answer to my question. I give 5 stars to the content because I started from zero and now I am thinking about my next programming project. I give five stars to the instructors because they did a great job teaching and helping me get the best out the course and a plus for their humorous attitude. I believe they have spent lots of hours building it, and it shows. Great job guys. Finally, I give five stars to the provider (coursera) because of the easiness and usability of their environment.

I recommend this to my friends / colleagues. If you have some prior Python knowledge - or can pick it up quickly - then you are at an advantage. Personally I found my occasional use of Visual Basic / VBA and Javascript helpful to understand the event driven model and the object orientated aspects. Also I'd done a low level Python course before on the basic syntax and flow control (all covered in this course, true...but if you've done it before this helps). Joe, Scott and John - and the other course tutors - are really good at what they do and have fun doing it clearly. That the course gives you very visual results from week 1 is very good; that this is done in a WWW browser framework (supplied as a Javascript library: just access the WWW page) means that it is very easy to get started and take it to a high level. The the art work for ships, cards, rocks etc. is all supplied helps a lot for those of us who are 'artistically challenged' to great something that looks good. On thing I missed - and hence struggled with - was the coverage of 'program state model' from a strategic perspective: events happen, how to record these when the event code finishes? Still all in: very good. Note that course material is not released 'in advance' which makes it difficult to get ahead in the material so you can have a break / catch up for vacation / illness: each week there is a Quiz or two (generally easy, 5 attempts allowed) an assignment (the focus: so harder..) and assessment of the previous week's project (except Wk 1!) every week. Something is 'Due' every 4 days maximum; in other words it is just like being at University proper.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>115547</review_data_id><review_date>2015-11-14</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I had a lot of fun with this class.

It really can make an absolute newbie to feel confident by the end of the course - confident to be able to learn programming. The tasks consist in quizzes and mini-projects. Quizzes are very useful and relevant (!), in my opinion. Not too simple, not too hard. The mini-progects are the essense of the course, they take 80 % of time, so I won't speak about them :) What is really great - it is codeskulptor.org and the code examples there! I will surely continue to use it after the course. CodeSkulptor is a python simpeGUI written by an instructor. Each code used in video lectures was given to us as a link, so that we could play with it, modify, study... That was extremely useful. There were several weeks in the beginnig, when I didn't need to open the videos! Studying the pieces of code provided there, where everything was explained in the comments + reading the documentation (provided by the course, too) made it possible to make the mini-projects.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>115425</review_data_id><review_date>2015-11-11</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Course content is awesome - I've been able to finish all tasks, and received all needed knowledge before I started to do it.

Early in the course I was a bit concerned but realized around week 3 of the first course that the content would be stimulating and challenging. The real challenge came with the introduction and implementation of Object Oriented Programming. As a conventional programmer having learned to write in BASIC and Assembly code on the Commodore 64 and TI-99/4A this was a much needed exercise in changing my thought process and approach to programming. With a lot of work, watching the videos, interacting in the course discussions, use of code clinic, and looking at supplemental content, I actually understand and can implement OOP. What is unique is that they make what might otherwise seem to be dull material very fun by teaching the concepts from the perspective of designing classic games. The instructors are, by far, the most engaging and thoughtful of any MOOC I have taken. I was impressed by the incredible amount of work they put into preparing the course. Saying they have gone above-and-beyond is an understatement. The video lectures are engaging. The creation of an online Python shell with easy to use built-in documentation clearly took an incredible amount of time. The end result is an easy-to-use IDE that allows participants to not only write code (and analyze it step-by-step through the use of Viz Mode), but to share and analyze others code by the simple sharing of a link. I was impressed by Dr. Warren's personal attention that he gives in the forums. Overall I found the instructors to be thoughtful, engaging, humorous, and interested in students learning the material. They have accomplished creating a learning environment that is fun and fosters continuing even when the material gets challenging. I have not seen this from any other course I have taken.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>115298</review_data_id><review_date>2015-11-09</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I really enjoyed this class. I looked forward every week to the next video. I couldn't skip ahead like in other classes but it was fine. I did have prior Python experience from other MOOCs and that helped. The instructors were good at visually explaining each concept. I recommend dissecting each example they give you. The quizzes were tougher than I expected and if I didn't have the prior Python knowledge I could see the Mini-Projects taking longer than you'd expect. Even with what I knew I had to refer to the videos several times. In the end, I feel way more comfortable with Python. I'm sad this course isn't longer.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>115293</review_data_id><review_date>2015-11-09</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course has helped me a lot in learning to program.

I honestly wish some of my college courses were as well constructed. Every part of it worked together to teach new concepts without forgetting to reinforce and extent the older ones. All the videos were direct and on-point for the concepts you'd need for the week's project; the quizzes kept you very honest about your class video watching and highlighted the finer points of the concepts you'd need for the big homework project for the week. The focus on making those projects small games of increasing complexity but simple game play was spot-on too - both fun and rewarding on a regular basis. Even the grading scheme - where you run through several of your classmates' assignments and grade to criteria, was a clever way to have group participation without the typical problems of group work. And the CodeSculptor web-based Python development environment eliminated just about all the computer/OS specific problems. WELL DONE!! One thing that seemed to be a negative was the work depended on the SimpleGUI libraries, which are not otherwise available outside CodeSkulptor which leaves your games stuck there - but since then I've read about SimpleGUICS2Pygame which should help in breaking your games free. Also, while it is not meant as a comprehensive course on Python, it seemed that some concepts were too quickly introduced and put to use before understanding them and why they exist - Classes/OOP stands out. Also, sooo much dad humor... But - for an introduction - my appetite is whet, and I'm off to see what else is out there. Well done to Joe, Rick, John, Stephen and Rice on University for making a great MOOC.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>115260</review_data_id><review_date>2015-11-08</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python is an excellent course, with very good teachers and materials.

And you'll have been taught in a very well thought out and 'layered' way which will have you internalising a lot of the material without you realising it (until you come to code something later and surprise yourself how easily you're doing it), and also experiencing just how much simpler and easier things can be with the object-oriented approach. There are a few times towards the latter part of the the course where you can experience how relatively small amounts of programming with classes/objects leads to relatively powerful effects. (This course was my first exposure to OOP, so that was my experience having become very comfortable with procedural, non-OOP programming in the past.) The instructors/lecturers are highly likeable, and are clearly very invested in the quality of the course. And one thing that's important to point out is that they have provided a substantial amount of support material: weekly 'concepts' go over the material taught in detail with plenty of examples; and weekly practice exercises that are pretty easy, and yet very helpful in cementing your knowledge and building up your coding confidence. The tools provided - CodeSkulptor for coding in your browser without having to download and install complex software, and "Viz Mode", for studying in detail what's going on in the bit of code you just wrote that isn't working as you expected it to - are just superb and well documented. CodeSkulptor in particular just makes it easy to get going in the course (and also helps to make peer reviewing much easier), and the Viz Mode - while I didn't use it much - is VERY helpful for gaining an understanding of what is going on 'under the hood' of Python (e.g., how lists are mutated, how local variables 'disappear' after a function has returned, etc., etc.) I could go on for longer, but if you are (like I was just before I started this) interested in learning a powerful, widely-used programming language within the context of a larger specialisation that is designed to teach the core concepts of computer science (this course if the first part of the 'Fundamentals of Computing' Coursera specialisation, then just enroll on the next course, and definitely sign up for certification if you can afford it, because that will help you to get all of your assignments in by the deadlines and to finish this great course!

I had some experience with SAS and SQL, but this is the second "real" programming course I have ever taken. Things I like: The contents are well-structured in an interesting manner. Instead of tedious long lectures on types of variables, mathematical crises or Turing machine you are actually building your knowledge from making games in this class. The course is friendly to newbies like myself, but it also gets deeper and systematic along the way. Joe and Scott are fantastic lecturers. The lectures are clear, well-paced and relaxed. The forum is very helpful with many members active and willing to lend a hand. The peer review is a good process to learn from other peoples' work. The only thing I don't like: The last project was too difficult in terms of math and some notions are ambiguous in the lecture. For instance the fraction should be a constant and should always be in the opposite direction with the moving direction (which is not necessarily the same as the current direction of the ship). I saw a lot of people directly using the ship's direction to calculate the fraction, which is not correct. These calculations should be provided so people do not have to spend hours solving problems on maths and physics. This is a programming class after all :) To conclude, I strongly recommend this class to whoever begins to learn programming or has some background in other languages but wants to learn python.

Infact i am going to build my career based on this language. For me this class was not just about games(I loved building and playing them- even showed off with them in my work place) its my basis for learning more OOPS languages and also a foundation for my masters preparations. Thanks a lot to this course and the professors. It was well coordinated and crisp.

Remarks made were clear to beginners yet concise and succinct enough for refresher students too. e.g. in my case learning Python GUI from a background of compiled languages. The instructor team are clearly committed to making this a positive, useful, empowering and beneficial experience for *every* learner. They clearly want everyone to succeed. And to that end they've clearly invested much time in developing and polishing this 4/5th iteration of this course. When you add to that their boundless enthusiasm, Python-esque zany humour (and choice of t-shirts and ties), the team really does "give it all" for the thousands of students taking this course. As to RICE University, I can only congratulate them for their insight that developing solid MOOC offerings is time well spent and this course is an excellent example of what can be done migrating classroom experience to the global MOOC platform. Well done supporting your own people and in turn potentially hundreds of thousands of future learners. As an experienced software developer who took a long career diversion into first aid and emergency care, this has been an enjoyable and productive way to get my head back into Computer science and coding, as well as apply that knowledge in a fun way - that of building well known graphical games. Many Thanks to the RICE CS Team!!!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>114059</review_data_id><review_date>2015-10-08</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Probably the most interesting form of teaching programming.

I took this course because I want to start data science specialisation in the university (my major specialisation is a manager, this is an extra-course to choose). It includes 4 disciplines and starts with learning Python. I found it really interesting, but I was a pretty average student in programming classes and school, and I was afraid that I won't be smart enough for taking this class. This is why I decided to start learning Python in advance, in summer (the specialisation started in autumn). I never thought that, first of all, it would be SO interesting for me to learn Python, and second of all, that I will manage to learn it. But I did! And I wouldn't do that if these great teachers weren't there to teach, if stuff and other students weren't there to help. I loved that you explained everything in an easy way, I loved your fun mini-projects! And I've been studying Python in my university for a month, and this goes so much easier that it could have been without your help. Though there are lots of things I need to learn and I find out about new functions and methods (well, there are many new things because the direction of our university class is different, and that means learning new specific features), it goes very smoothly, and it's not just because this course gave me the essential basics of Python, it's also because I became so much confident and thanks to Coursera and this course, I know that I can be pretty good at programming.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>113829</review_data_id><review_date>2015-10-01</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>It was great.

Hats off to both Scott, John for their crisp teaching style and the amount of hard work they have put in. However, I completed with a feeling that a lot of different aspects have not been covered. Course is focused only on GUI oriented programming. Even though personally, GUI aspects were interesting to me as I never worked on GUI before and got a good incite into it. There are many different aspects like networking, file operations, multi-threading, IPC etc. which were not touched upon. There are probably more advanced courses to cover those. Thanks a lot for giving me chance to learn.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>113821</review_data_id><review_date>2015-10-01</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Joe and Scott exhibit energy and enthusiasm while teaching.

Professors Rixner and Warren, the two leads, explain concepts clearly and in a way that builds logically. They really seem to understand how we learn. They also seem to really enjoy teaching, and working with each other. It sounds funny but it made me feel good to watch their interactions. In terms of what I learned--I cannot believe I was able to complete an asteroids game in 8 weeks. They provide you with a very structured sequence of steps that make it possible to do what seems like an impossibility at first. Finally, as woman who likely is about the same age as the instructors--when I think back to when I was in college, never in my wildest dreams did I think I would be able to learn to program in my 40's!

I've had the great fortune of obtaining college and graduate degrees at wonderful institutions where brilliant thinkers who also happened to be master teachers were the norm.

The class was very challenging for me, but I found that they provided all the materials I needed if I was willing to put in the time and effort.

The best course I have ever taken - Coursera or not! The absolute goal of the instructors was to help students to learn! every question on the quiz was aiming at helping with mini-projects! it was obvious there was a lot of time put in in structuring this course -- they were so many excellent components of it -- the Concepts and Examples section, the Programming Tips videos, the TA suppot, the You Tube videos, the Code Clinic!!! I have raved about this course to my all friends, family and co-workers! I felt sad when the course was over! Never felt anything about any of my classes before! It would be fair to mention TAs -- they were extremely helpful!! and seemed like they were constantly online, always ready to help! Every little detail of this course was designed to made the learning fun!! IF there is a thing such a best instructor's award, these instructors should have it!!

There are no prerequisites, so everybody can start the course. It is fun and interesting to follow. It is also very useful. I really liked codeskulptor and the fact that the instructors give it as a solution to programming that does not require any other tool (just program in your browser).

The only thing I'd suggest is to add a final mini-project that doesn't have so detailed instructions or program template. Such a way, a student has to think about how to organize handlers, classes, functions etc. I mean he starts a new program from zero.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>113545</review_data_id><review_date>2015-09-28</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course is a great way to get into programming if you have never done it before.

I am interested in learning Python and I took this class for a quick introduction into the subject. As expected I found the class easy given my background. What I did not expect was the high quality of the teaching, quizzes and projects. The instructors have put a truly excellent course together making the introduction to python fun. I really did have fun building the games and in the process can write Python code. I would also like to say that their CodeScultptor IDE is awesome (along with their simpleGUI package). I could have easily picked this stuff up by reading a book, but this was fun and the instructors are excellent.

The basic classroom model includes video lectures, discussion forums, automated grading, student grading, and more. Many classes are free, or a certificate can be had for a nominal fee. Other classes or specializations, a set of classes, may have a somewhat higher associated cost, but nothing approaching even my local community college rates. Programming in Python provides a challenging, beginner level of instruction. The carrot (caret?) at the end is a game similar to Asteroids that they affectionately call RiceRocks, as this class is provided by Rice University. The primary instructors, Joe Warren and Scott Rixner, provide friendly, informed lectures, lots of assistance through the forums, and generally have an entertaining teaching style that shows their enthusiasm for the material. I highly recommend the class.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>113509</review_data_id><review_date>2015-09-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Excellent, really good content, very well-explained and paced.

The Forum and he Code Clinic are great places if you're stuck and need help. Scott Rixner and Joe Warren are great teachers, and CodeSculptor is a great tool for people who are new to programming. VizMode is a great debugging tool, and although I didn't use it often, I think it's great for new programmes. John Greiner's "Programming tips" videos were very helpful, as were his instruction on how to use VizMode. Coursera, as a provider, was stable and easy to use.

Rice University (Scott Rixner) has programmed a web interpreter for Python called CodeSkulptor that makes it really easy to experiment, try things out, and run your programs from any platform. It can even function as a single-step emulator/debugger. Combining the CodeSkulptor platform, with a series of interesting and progressive projects, and a good organization of the Python programming topics, you also get a group of Rice professors (Joe Warren, Scott, and John Greiner) who, while sometimes a bit geekish, really have fun teaching, and it's a pleasure learning from them. Only downside - no text; my own notes are now my Python reference work. (On the other hand, perhaps making me write, edit, and reorganize my own reference book helped me learn!)</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>111673</review_data_id><review_date>2015-08-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The instructors laid out this class well.

Each week the concepts are presented to you in the context of a game, which you will then go out and make. The games themselves range from memory, to pong, to blackjack, to asteroids, and are surprisingly fun to play after you've made them. Moreover, the instructors frame the making of each game within several reasonably straight forward steps, giving the programming of the games a gamelike feel themselves. The other thing about this course that I found extremely valuable was the peer review system. Instead of having a machine grade your games, each student reviews the games of five other students, and grades them on the rubric. I learned quite a bit about proper design from playing other peoples' games, and graders have also often left useful comments on my own games.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>111655</review_data_id><review_date>2015-08-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Before this lesson, I know nothing about coding.

The professors are funny, and explain things really well while also keeping the class interesting. I'm suggesting this class to all my friends who have ever expressed an interest in exploring programming. I also loved the way the class was structured. It was broken up into weeks, and each week was broken into two sections. Each section had a few lecture videos, and a quiz (which you could take multiple times, to make sure you really understand everything). Each week had a mini-project, where we made some little game to annoy our friends with. At the end of the course, I feel like I have a good set of stand-alone programs that I can brag about, and refer back to as I continue learning.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>111639</review_data_id><review_date>2015-08-15</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I enjoyed this class.

The teachers were amazing, and I learned quite much from it. Before, I only knew the syntax of python from Codecademy, and I didn't know how to actually apply it to anything, but from here, I learned many valuable tools from which I can now expend on to actually make some programs I wish to make. This course was truly a gateway to real programming from what I only knew as syntax. The instructors were kind and I really enjoyed how they tried to engage their students with some humor in their video (of course, humors are not the focus of their video) and they really do know how to teach! I loved the lesson pace, and I really encourage any programming beginner to take this class because the lessons were well organized and compare to other course I took (as little as they are) this class's materials were concise and to the point, enabling their student to make really fun program and make them feel proud of themselves for their new accomplishment in rather short time.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>111530</review_data_id><review_date>2015-08-13</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Great intro to python.

The course does demand a fair bit of time each week, but the lectures are short and informative, the quizzes are detailed and complete and require a bit of extra programming and the mini-project and peer reviews require a few hours of extra effort. But the results are amazing and time will be well spent. Each mini-project comes with a lot of assistance to help you complete the task.

It covers Python from the ground up. I’ve programmed in Python for several years and still learned a lot. I took the course because I knew I had gaps in my understanding of Python. I particularly appreciated the part on OOP (object-oriented programming). It is something that I used before, but did not really understand until I took this course. You learn Python by building games using a web-based version of Python developed specifically for the course called CodeSkulptor. At first, I wasn’t sure about using CodeSkulptor, but it was a good choice. It removes the struggle of just trying to get Python to work on your machine that can wear you out before you even begin. Building the games was fun, and when you get a game to work correctly, you want to do back-flips. They also have a Code Clinic where you can send your code when you are having problems. I used it a couple of times and found it invaluable. They responded quickly and were very helpful.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>111478</review_data_id><review_date>2015-08-12</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I thought this was a great class I will continue to take more classes!

If not for the puns and healthy rivalry between the instructors, I would've enjoyed the class lesser. I would recommend this class to any person who is interested in learning programming!

I started with no experiences in programming at all and walked away building my very own Asteroid game. I am so proud of myself and grateful to have taken these classes. The instructors were enthusiastic in teaching the concepts and the discussion forum was also helping in building the concepts needed to build the games. I would to thank Rice University, Joe, Scott, John and Steven in providing the course. I know they have put a lot of work into making the best course I ever took in MOOC and I have taken many courses and this by far is the best one. So thank you very much. I look forward in progressing my computer language skill.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>111452</review_data_id><review_date>2015-08-11</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Before jumping into An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python, offered by Rice University, I was attempting to learn Python on my own. I was not happy with how my progress was going, I couldn't see the big picture. That all changed with the way Joe Warren and Scott Rixner presented the pertinent information, while giving glimpses of it's larger context. While challenging, the class is easily manageable if you short on time and are determined to understand the material. The mode of learning how to program through creating games is a huge boon to most types of people. I feel this is because you can immediately present and show off what you've accomplished to give yourself a morale boost and continue on after a hard week of struggling through concepts that are presented. I would highly recommend this course for beginners, novices, and really all levels of programming understanding. There's so much to add to your programs, even after you've finished the assignments. Just remember to turn them in on time! I may have missed the deadline twice even though I finished days before it was due. oops!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>111449</review_data_id><review_date>2015-08-11</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Life changing class. Went from zero programming knowledge to making multiple games. Teachers were great and explained the material really well. The mini-projects and quizzes helped solidify each new topic for the week.

This is the go to course.It shows various aspects of programming in a fun and challenging way. It really makes you work hard and in the end you will be amazed with what you can do .This course is a great introduction to Python. But if you are a complete novice I would recommend doing Codecademy's python course and even a bit of reading of How To Think Like A Computer Scientist beforehand. A background in programming will surely help . But otherwise this course is a great option for anyone looking for an introduction to Python. The teachers are amazing and even the discussion forums and support groups are really helpful.So even if you are stuck there is plenty of help available.Not many courses give joy but this one surely does! So go ahead and take this course.

I'd recommend this class to anyone at any level of programming experience who wants to get a good introduction to Python. I have over 30 years of development experience, but have never coded Python before. Even though this class was geared to student with little to no programming experience, the programming assignments and quizzes were still challenging enough to keep me busy on the weekends :) Fortunately, the class was a also lot of fun. Spending hours doing game development is a lot more fun than building esoteric applications. It's also more rewarding to play games that you've built yourself, rather than something you just downloaded from the web. I also can't speak highly enough of the class curriculum, the instructors, and the individual course content. Usually, each week's lectures and the explanation of the accompanying project assignment would be split among the 3 main instructors, each providing a different area of focus and expertise - Python Language, Data Structures, Game Mechanics , Best Practices, and Debugging. I think the delegation of these tasks made the class more interesting, since it allowed each instructor to focus on part of the course they were most enthusiastic about teaching. The best part was that you could tell that the instructors (at least 2 of them :) ) had fun teaching these classes!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>111423</review_data_id><review_date>2015-08-11</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>A fantastic course which teaches you python to a 'dangerous' level!

You receive study material as video lectures. There is about 5-8 video clips per week, each is no longer than 15 min, usually around 10. Clips are very easy to understand, with little bit of humor and just the right length to stay focus for the whole time. You required to completed a quiz each week (usually 2 parts about 8 question in each part), which helps with preparation for the mini-project of the week and to understand the lectures better. Mini-project takes the most (at least for me with zero programming experience) time. Overall I would highly recommend this course for python beginners.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>111403</review_data_id><review_date>2015-08-11</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The content was just right.

Instructors Joe, Scott and John are very good teachers, taking it slowly and explaining in full. To me the main assets of the course were: -use of the online codeskulptor for development and 'simplegui' -Weekly mini projects and two quizzes. Really had to think! which is great as its the only way to learn programming is to program. -Structure of the course. Started slowly and each week builds on the last. very good pace to learn. -Peer review. I thought i wouldn't like this, i had to mark 5 other peoples min-projects. Thought it would be a waste of time, but it wasn't. Really interesting to see how other people think and i picked up many ideas and good style/s.

The instructors from Rice University built an own Python coding platform (codeskulptor.org) that really helps writing and submitting the weekly projects. The course material is very on-the-point. As the programming projects consist of small games every week (Pong and Asteroids among them), the motivation to test them is pretty high. The class does take some work each week and some people on the forums mentioned some trouble - however the instructors even have a sub-forum called "code clinic" where they review "broken" code and support when necessary. I recommend this class for everyone looking to start programming in Python who can invest the 5-7 hours a week. (Skipping a week might lead to some frustrations I suppose, as the material buils upon itself).</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>111350</review_data_id><review_date>2015-08-10</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>An engrossing, educational well paced, course using excellent tools.

Being able to code simple games made it very rewarding. Instructors really work hard to make it enjoyable and the discussion forums are excellent. As someone with very little coding experience, I found this class quite challenging and spent longer than the approximated time in the later part of the course on each code. Although at times I felt like banging my head against a brick wall, with the tools provided you can eventually work out the solution (might just take a long time) and it is incredibly rewarding once you finally get your games to work.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>111344</review_data_id><review_date>2015-08-10</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Hi.

I have completed part 1 and part 2 of this course having no programming experience or education to begin with. I can now competently write my own simple to intermediate level programs in Python. I recently took a look at several other languages to see where I would like to go after I complete the Fundamentals of Computer Science specialization. I can say that just going through these courses has opened my eyes to understanding other programming languages. Of course I would need to learn them, but there is enough similarity that I can comprehend their basics much easier. I'm glad that I decided to go with Python and these courses first. I went through the signature track. Signing up for it was easy. If you don't have the money to pay, Coursera offers financial aid that's easy to apply for, just look for the small link at the bottom of the payment page. The courses seemed like they were going slow for the first few weeks, but then it quickly ramped up in pace to moderate/moderate fast. With this in mind, DO THE PRACTICE PROBLEMS. They will make life easier in the long run, it's why they are there. Some of them seem like they may be repeats, but are slightly dissimilar aimed to give more practice on important things later or gives another underlying concept. There's plenty of help in the forums from classmates, TA's, and the instructors. The instructors are active on the forums, they didn't make the videos and leave. The audio level from the videos are more consistent then other programming courses I looked at during this course. There are a few times where it got a little quieter, mostly when they were using pip and running code. On my quiet laptop I can hear just fine unless the tv or a nearby fan is on. There's no major fluctuations so all was well for me chromecasting it to the tv and turning it up or just moving away from the fan a little. The class is using Python 2.6 in a custom built interface called codeskulptor. Documentation is exceptional and focused. They use a module called simplegui as there GUI creator. It really helps to simplify some things so you can focus on learning how's and whys of programming. Some differences between simplegui and pythons built-in GUI called tkinter. In tkinter you would create a window, then create a frame, then place the frame in the window, then create a canvas, then place the canvas. In simplegui they combined the create and placement into one call combining the basic elements you would usually initialize for most of the projects. You would then also create and place a button or label with one call instead of two, making it less verbose. You may fall in love with the simplicity of simplegui and want to keep using it on your own. But let me tell you that with it's simplicity it brings more limitations. Don't worry about what version of python they use, their goal is creating a foundation of programming, and they do well at teaching this. I myself would practice the concepts using both version 2 and 3 and also tkinter because I was worried that I may be learning something that's not useful. It's not the case. Everything is transferable, in fact, there's just some minor differences between version 2 to 3 and simplegui to tkinter. One of the things you'll do is look some things up in the documentation they provide. It only takes a few minutes to do and understand by how concise they made it. This is another skill that you will need to learn for programming. In their documentation they also provide examples to the same skills in tkinter and a few other modules, I believe pygame was one. These extras in the documentation are not full, but show how you can "convert" your skills over easily. I highly recommend this class. It is thought out and honed in well. In fact, after taking this class, you'll likely have a python interpreter pinned to your taskbar and with every problem you'll click and in minutes type out a solution. You'll also likely view things around you in a different light because of the gained logic. TL;DR - All in all. They made it easy to learn Python and transferable programming skills. You just need to show up and do the practice problems.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>111294</review_data_id><review_date>2015-08-10</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course is great introduction to the principles of programming.

I thoroughly enjoyed each week's assignment - I thought the idea to teach python through programming games was masterful. Although the beginning games are somewhat simplistic, they were at the beginning of the learning curve for the class, as appropriate skills were taught to us week by week. It resulted in allowing for mastery of each week's material by even novices, and a feeling of satisfaction for creating a workable game each week. The instructors got along with each other very well, and did a great job injecting humor and encouragement into the videos! I am looking forward to extending my python skills to other programming areas!!!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>111253</review_data_id><review_date>2015-08-09</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Fantastic course - enthusiastic teachers, great peer review system and Codeskulptor is a work of magic.

Personally I've had a tiny bit of prior experience from studying computer science in high school, mostly in C and a small bit in Assembler so I did have a small bit of prior knowledge. Still I couldn't really write any meaningful programs just from my high school knowledge, whereas now after this course I have a solid toolbox to begin programming with. Also the weekly projects of the course were in and of themselves meaningful, such as programming the games: pong, memory and blackjack(albeit with simplistic rules) that I can now take and expand on to make them better with the knowledge of the entire course under my belt now. Moreover I can envision how various popular games that I like playing were created, at least the programming portions of them(not the graphics, animations, etc), and think I have the tools to write similar games. I might not be able to write them in the most efficient way as I still lack programming experience but it's at least I can create a working code to achieve the same results. Higher efficiency will naturally come with experience. I think this course makes programming very accessible to people with little to no prior knowledge to programming at all.

Scott and Joe are a quirky team that make each lesson fun and John's programming tips helped with a better understanding of certain concepts and working with CodeSkulptor's Viz mode for debugging. I felt that each topic was shown in enough detail to be easy to understand and work with without watering down the content. The projects were fun and I found myself spending many additional hours to add content and functionality to my previously submitted projects. I have two (small) complaints. There were a couple videos (or segments within a video) where the audio was a little hard to hear and it would be nice if the video resized with the window. I often worked with two windows open side by side on a single monitor and would overlap the windows to get everything I needed on screen. Minor complaints overall. I've already recommended the course to several friends and may even retake it just for fun to see what I can do with CodeSkulptor. Some students have shown that it's very powerful when you have the right knowledge. Thanks Scott, Joe, John, Stephen, and Coursera for this course. I'm really looking forward to the next courses and continuing to learn Python!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>74509</review_data_id><review_date>2015-05-06</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I worked professionally as a Software Developer but I had never used Python.

I was a little scared and worried I would get lost quickly. However, the video lectures for the course were amazing - to put it in perspective, I wish I had had lecturers this good during my Biochemistry degree at Imperial College. Everything was broken down into short videos for very specific topics, and we had a multiple choice quiz, and programming project every week. In fact, we built a new game using a tool called Codeskulptor every single week, and each time I marvelled at how far I had come. My favourites to build were Pong, Blackjack and RiceRocks(similar to Asteroids). I should also say that it was immensely fun and satisfying to review the work of other peers - to play their game and see how it handled differently, and to look at how they have implemented and structured their code. From doing this, I found new ways to code more concisely and effectively, and realised how many different ways were possible. I also benefited a lot from the coding templates provided in this course - I learnt how to break things down into little sections, and how to structure my code in a logical order. A lot of other courses I have done, did not give me nearly enough advise on this, so I found this course incredibly useful. I cannot recommend enough!!!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>74434</review_data_id><review_date>2015-05-02</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The content is just perfect.

Also, there is not much to say Coursera, which has a life-changing impact. If correctly used, Coursera can open lots of new rooms in many aspect in our lives, put new personel targets and these in return I'm sure will make our world better.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>74427</review_data_id><review_date>2015-05-01</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>an excellent, engaging course! i had prior programming experience in other languages and knew very little of Python. i have a great interest in games but had no particular goal of learning interactive programming -- my goal was primarily just to learn more of Python... which not only i did but i now have an interest in actually programming games too. i enjoyed myself immensely during this course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>74426</review_data_id><review_date>2015-05-01</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Thanks Joe/Scott/John for the wonderful teaching..

Even back then, I was oblivious to the existence of Python. I took this class as an opportunity to have some fun while learning something that seemed powerful, yet managable. I consider myself fortunate to have stumbled upon this MOOC. After the complition of the two parts, I can safely say that I am hooked. Both on Python and the Intructors as well. John and Scott made this a class an awesome experience. I am looking forward to learning with them in the near future.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>74423</review_data_id><review_date>2015-05-01</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Great course for those who want starts journey with programming.

Codeskulptor makes it very easy to access your work whether you're at home or out and about. This allows you to access your work on public computers as well. The teachers were engaging, funny, and created a positive online atmosphere in which to learn useful skills in Python. Also, the fact that we learned the concepts through game programming added for an extra layer of entertainment while learning the course.

I already knew some basic Python and mostly wanted to solidify that and learn about event driven programming. The course was just the right pace for me (having some prior experience) but may be a little fast for a total noob. The video lectures were very clear and helpful, but for me personally I wish they had not included quite so many details of how to do things in the projects, and let me figure them out myself. The style of the videos and production quality was very good, and I enjoyed the personal and humerous parts a lot. I really felt like I got to know the instructors a bit while taking the course. The projects were really fun. As with the videos I may have liked a little less pre-coded structure, but for a beginner this was probably necessary. Overall I really enjoyed this course, learned a lot, and would definitely recommend it to a friend.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>74404</review_data_id><review_date>2015-04-30</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The class was realy intersting and exciting. Wouldn't say it was challenging - all the quizzes and mini projects was not hard, but still they did require some hours of work and knowing the week's material.

I would definitely suggest this course to anyone starting his way to the computer science.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>74403</review_data_id><review_date>2015-04-30</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The design of this course is very neat. The combination of video teaching, quiz, miniprojects and practice is a good way to learn. Particularly, the practice helps form ideas as well as part of codes in the miniproject. It will be even more helpful if more videos are available (i know this is demanding). Also, walking through some Python code snippets will contribute speeding up learning curve as well. The good thing of coursera is the flexible time schedule. Honestly, I've done all the assignments but never completed any of them on time. The important thing is to keep one's own pace and squeeze enough time to learn and apply this skill in one's career in future. Taking courses from Scott and Joe reminds me how suck many my instructors do. Sincerely appreciated. I enjoy learning with fun.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>74400</review_data_id><review_date>2015-04-30</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>CodeSkulptor is really awesome.

The pacing is fantastic, it was rarely too easy or too hard, but information dense and consistently challenging at just the right level based on what's been taught that week. Each week also builds beautifully upon what's been learned in the previous weeks and the projects are designed to integrate everything you've learned up to that point. Just masterfully done. You really get the sense that a ridiculous amount of time and effort has been put into creating and polishing this course. The professors are brilliant teachers and tremendously likeable. Codeskulptor was created for this course and it's such a great introduction and a powerful tool (as showcased by some of the projects in the Hall of Fame). The forums are priceless with really helpful contributors and TAs. I can't thank these guys enough so felt compelled to leave a glowing review. It really is the least I can do.

This was not my first Python beginner class, but it helped me to much better understand certain concepts, such as object-oriented programming, more easily due to the visual element and the time the professors took to work us through it.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>74368</review_data_id><review_date>2015-04-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course structure progressively built on the previous lessons to produce a game that incorporated a lot of the previously learnt concepts.

Although I have a degree in CS, I am a newbie to Python. I enrolled in this course as a way to mentor a near-15 teenager. He showed some interest in programming and I wanted him to have a study partner while he engaged in something challenging. I learned some Python along the way, had a lot of fun, got to witness first hand just how effective this course is at forming programming thinking in beginners, provided they have some support to get past the tough spots, both emotionally (some frustration is involved in coding&amp;debugging) and intellectually (the object oriented philosophy was quite a sharp turn)</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>74351</review_data_id><review_date>2015-04-28</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The content is suitable for beginning but is also challenging in a manner that it leaves one with actual coding abilities.

One gets to show a game one created at the end which is very satisfying. The instructors are great entertainers and sometimes it feels like watching an action movie!

I can say this with authority, because I tried to complete its first edition and I had to drop. Then I tried the 2nd edition and I had to drop again. The 3rd time was the charm however, the instructors passion for this course is inspiring, they put in crazy hours, unpaid, to keep the forums running and give thousands and thousands of students feedback and encouragement. That's ignoring the fact that they have built not just a developer environment that runs efficiently in the browser, a python module for that environment to run graphics and user interfaces, AND a visualization tool, that can step you through any program you load, and show how your instructions are placed in memory and operated upon. Astonishing. If you can put in the time, and you may need to watch the lecture videos two, even three times, do the exercises, work the quizzes until you have a 95 or better, and obviously complete your weekly programming projects, then you will get a solid grasp of programming fundamentals. I cannot recommend this class highly enough for someone interested in programming or digital game design. Also if you have the time, the codecademy python course is an excellent supplement.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>74317</review_data_id><review_date>2015-04-28</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Excellent, especially if you are new to Python.

I did not enjoy the deadlines--the quizzes always seemed a bit more difficult than anticipated and the mini-projects were progressively more difficult each week. In fact, I was unable to complete the last two object-oriented programming projects--I just couldn't break through with the concepts, and the deadlines were ultimately ignored as a result.

I tried many sites to learn different programming languages. I would eventually learn what I was trying to learn. But, it would usually take a lot of times with lot of pain, finding every piece of knowledge in different sites or books. None of the classes were as structural as this class. The material build slowly allow you to absorb and digest the subjects. There are good source of practice material that carefully crafted to easy the learning It is not like most of web classes that start extremely easy and all of a sudden jump to a advance level, with big gap of missing knowledge in the middle. Which make you think: "I must be not smart enough since I just don't get it now!" No, don't fall for that trap! I took too many of those classes and I know when I see the "trap door.

Second for me through Coursera. Class was very well structured and all mini projects built very well over subjects that were teached before. I had that moment where all seemed too hard, somewhere in the middle. But after that, it got somehow easy to do last weeks of the course. So I guess I learned something. For programming tasks, you don't need anything, course provides CodeSkulpture, which is very good.

You get to learn the fundamentals of object-oriented programming that apply beyond Python by the end of the course. What's most important though, is that you get to learn it in a very fun way, by building your own games and learning from two of the most interesting professors I've ever known. The instructors are all great. Prof. Rixner, Prof. Greiner personally built CodeSkulptor which is an online tool you can use to program in python. The same goes for simpleGUI as well. Spending those hours watching the video lectures really built a bond between me and all the instructors. Overall, if you're interested in the course, you should definitely try it out. I'm 95 percent confident you'll love it too! Oh yeah, and I'm going to Rice this fall as a freshman undergraduate. This course definitely contributed my decision making process in a positive way.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>74287</review_data_id><review_date>2015-04-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I studied Mathematics and Computer Science in the 80's and early 90's.

Rice's course kept me focused, and helped me to see what was important and what wasn't. The gimmick of having each weekly project be some kind of game kept my interest up while I was learning the intricacies of Python. Scott Rixne'rs CodeSkulptor web IDE was very valuable, allowing program composition and execution in my browser.

It appears to work equally well as an introduction to programming for the well-motivated uninitiated. Because of the focus on development of fully functioning games as projects, this class forces students to get considerably more practice in programming in Python than one gets by just doing the assignments in the more broadly aimed (but also good!) introductory class Programming for Everybody. This class is well thought out, well-structured, well-presented and well-supported. The use of the codeskulptor.org tool, developed by one of the instructors, provides an easy entry point that enables one to get right into the material without getting bogged down in demotivating installation snafus. Plan to devote no fewer than eight hours a week to the class to derive good value from enrollment.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>74243</review_data_id><review_date>2015-04-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The class was really good and I learned a lot.

This the best curriculum you can imagine if you want to understand and learn python. The tools, the content and the incremental steps you experience as a student keep you going. One thing though is, that as beginner you should schedule more time than proposed - much more time. You will see that the additional material, practices are needed to grasp the content, if you are not familiar with other programming languages. This is a fast pace course which brings you quiet far, if you are a beginner, you can still master it, but need the additional material and going through this just takes time.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>74233</review_data_id><review_date>2015-04-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Very good!

In only 8 weeks of time, the course (split into two parts) means to take the student from complete Python beginner to a good knowledge of the main nuts and bolts of the language, and all the programming concept that comes with it. The main item of practice is a webIDE called CodeSkulptor, it implements the possibility to play around with a slightly simplified version of Python 2.7 and a graphic module called simpleGUI to create various games, from pong to the final, 300+ lines of code that builds RiceRocks, the asteroid game. Most of the course is fun to watch, and while it requires effort to be followed, it really pays off in terms of skills and final satisfaction. I recommend it to all beginner coders out there, if they feel they can free up a couple days a week at most to dive in Python and programming.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>74219</review_data_id><review_date>2015-04-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I think the instructors are awesome especially Joe Warren.

I'd be doing everyone a great disservice if I rate this course anything below five stars. Wonderful instructors and well structured practice exercises and projects. Let me warn you, though. The learning curve gets steeper as you reach week 4 and onwards. The 7~10 hours/week workload is more inclined toward the higher side. If fact, I had to spend 12 hours each on Pong and Memory, 18 hours on Blackjack( Yep, you read that right :) ) and 14 hours each on Spaceship and Asteroids. You should be fine if you give it 2 hours daily, and progress in the sequence specified by the instructors. (Watch lectures &gt;&gt; Do practice exercises &gt;&gt; Do quizzes &gt;&gt; Do project &gt;&gt; Revert back to lectures if you feel you've missed something in between). It's rigorous sometimes, but totally worth the effort. And there's plenty of help from the community TAs, fellow Pythonistas, and the instructors(Code Clinic) if you ever need it.

The course can be useful both to those who have some prior knowledge and complete newbies.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>74209</review_data_id><review_date>2015-04-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course content was top notch and professors explained every concept thoroughly and also provided documentation.

Nice pace. I am an engineer by trade and the field I am in is progressively becoming more reliant on programming. As such, an understanding of basic computer science is needed. This class gives a very useful, well taught, and interesting introduction in computer science. For one, it uses Python which is probably the best for those starting to understand programming and computer science. Another aspect is the focus on building games. Project-based learning makes it easier to comprehend the nuances of programming and the use of games makes it interesting. Finally, the amount of lame jokes and weird behaviors by the professors helps make the course not as intimidating as would, say, learning a programming language just through the documentation. To sum up, this is a good course to learn programming and computer science regardless of what aims you have for your education.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>74190</review_data_id><review_date>2015-04-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>One of the best Moocs out there period.

I was completely new to this language but found the emphasis on games as the vehicle for learning very useful and interesting. The CodeSkulptor browser based programming environment made the learning process that much easier. The mix of lectures, exercises, quizzes and assignments was well judged. The discussion forum and the assistance provided in the form of templates for each assignment, again, were well balanced.

The instructors are very engaging and make the material fun (but hey, you make games so how could it not be fun). The tools for this class, Codeskulptor in particular are well thought out and easy to get started with and use. The forums were very active and helped in a lot of situations. I took one star off on provider because the Coursera site is pretty dense and can be hard to navigate when you first use it, but it's generally well designed and completely functional.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>74147</review_data_id><review_date>2015-04-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Taking this course was a great experience - the class material is excellent and well structured, simplegui and codeskulptor (with codeskulptor's Vizmode also) are great tools to learn the basics of programming without the need to be intimidated by too many features at once.

A lot of handholding so you're able to complete the projects, but it is still very time consuming and can be difficult to grasp some of the concepts taught. If you do the practice exercises, read the forums, and watch all of the lectures you shouldn't have a problem completing the class, and although very enjoyable, it will consume a lot of your free time.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>74145</review_data_id><review_date>2015-04-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Wow. What an amazing class and set of instructors. I've worked in IT all my adult life (30 years!) and have a Computer Science degree from a first tier university. The sense of fun and accomplishment I enjoyed in the last two months rivals the experience of many years ago when I was programming in assembler (DEC VAX Macro-32), Pascal, and later C++. In fact, in presentation and accessibility, this class tops them all. The amount of information, help tools, Viz mode, PDFs, the quality of the video lectures, the humor, make it an incredible learning experience. Programming is not easy. The topics covered here are complex. But, this class does an amazing job in easing one into the wonderful field of programming and Computer Science. Thank you professors Joe Warren, Scott Rixner, John Greiner, and Stephen Wong, and Rice University for a beautiful job.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>74144</review_data_id><review_date>2015-04-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course content was just right.

I was immediately hooked. Although, I've had prior experience with Python, I've never used object orientation before and I've always had the feeling that I am struggling. Now, I feel much more accomplished and "dangerous" - as the instructors like to call it. Instructors &amp; Atmosphere: The instructors are very likable and genuinely care about the course and their students. The course atmosphere is very congenial and makes browsing through the forums a great pleasure. Pace: For me, as I was familiar with many of the concepts, the course's pace was excellent. I think that if you are a complete programming beginner, you will be struggling a fair bit. However, initial struggles are normal and there is help: Remember to check the forums, people are very active and helpful there. Also, the instructors have set up a "code clinic". Course TA's will have a look at your code and help you out. I thoroughly enjoyed the class and am very likely to continue the computation series with "Principles of Computation".</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>74138</review_data_id><review_date>2015-04-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I have gone from a an absolute beginner to be able to write my very own game.

I wanted to get to the point where I could at least read a program (a simple one) in python and figure out what it was doing. In fact, I got a lot more than that - I was very surprised to discover how user-friendly python is, and how transparent a lot of the language is. So now I would feel fully confident in writing a lot of straight forward programs in python - perhaps not building a complex game from scratch, but certainly programs that would do engineering calculations (I'm an engineer) or financial planning. What I most liked were the quizzes and mini-projects, which forced us to use the lecture material and concepts right away. I found them just the right level of difficult, in the sense that I often had to consult the documentation, I had to try and fail sometimes, but in the end they were always do-able, and there was always support when needed. There is very little I didn't like or that needs to be improved. It was a really good course. As a person who hadn't programmed for years, and had never used python, I suddenly feel fully able to read and write programs in python.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>61045</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-30</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I loved this class.

This is in sharp contrast to Codecademy, where you just follow the directions and don't really write much in the way of original code or implement your own methods. One minor criticism, though. I would have liked the opportunity to create classes from scratch for the practice of it. In the projects that use classes, the classes are already defined in the templates and students simply add methods to them.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60870</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-22</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Python and some basic usage for games.

There were lot of guidelines and templates to constrain our thinking in most productive and useful way, and they helped a lot in completing the assignments in time and learning the stuff along with it. And then we were free to wander around in the assignments, adding whatever additional features we could. This made the course very valuable and enriching. For improvement - There are many more topics that are not even touched upon. I would like to see a 10-15 minutes session that takes you on a quick informative ride of many features like file I/O, database storage, and other useful applications that can be built with Python.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60865</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-22</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course has been just perfect I wish it had continued to deepen learning</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60864</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-22</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I knew some python before taking this course.

Also the fact you get to do something practical with programming makes it even better since it shows beginners what can be done with programming. Usually beginner programming courses focus more on concepts and so the beginner student doesn't see the point. Having them make games help them see some practical applications. Since video games are becoming more and more mainstream, having the students make games is also a good way to get the masses interested in computer science. If you are an experienced programmer, this class is still good. Python is a fairly new language so it's a good way to help experienced programmers get used to this new language. If you are new to video game design, this class will interest you even more.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60854</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-22</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I expected to be able to write somewhat sophisticated programs in Python, and I think that goal was clearly achieved due to the efforts of Profs.

I got exactly what I wanted. The course was, generally, very well paced and clarified programming concepts in a way that I have not experienced before. The use of games to introduce this concepts was excellent and kept interest in a way that coding a school database that you know nobody will ever use would not. The two main things I would improve would be: (1) The inclusion of instruction in one of the weeks on a viable order for using all the extras (practice examples etc). They are incredibly useful, but the number of them sometimes confused me into using them when I didn't understand them yet, or past the point when they would have helped most. (2) A little more coding guidance for Object Orientated Programming since I had misunderstandings about it left over from other courses.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60816</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-21</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60813</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-21</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60812</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-21</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Great job</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60811</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-21</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is a fast-paced, challenging course that takes students from "hello, world" to a comfortable understanding of the basics of object-oriented programming and interaction in a gaming context in 9 weeks flat.

In such a short time to learn about linear programming, working with a gui, working with classes and between the lines working structuredly, in small steps, with neat code as a result. This course screams for a follow up. Not immediatly afterwards. 8 weeks with increasing difficulty and increasing study hours is long enough. Can't say where improvement is needed. It's complete. Maybe a follow up to make android and iOS games. Don't believe me.

This, I think, minimized the head-scratching that a more open-ended prompt would have created. The main thing I would improve is related to each week's quiz. If you're a perfectionist like me, and do 2nd attempts at the quizzes when you don't get 100%, you'll occasionally find the same question marks different sets of answers as correct on different versions of the same quiz.

I wanted to go beyond gaming. That's when I found this course. My heart dropped when I saw the course syllabus! I thought I could never make it, because it looked so complicated. Event-driven programming, local and global variables, object-oriented programming, iteration, classes... Nothing was familiar to me at that time. I thought I was going to learn text codes and HTML. But thanks to all four teachers, Teacher Scott, Teacher Joe, Teacher Steven, and Teacher John, I am now able to make interactive games in Python because they were able to explain clearly to a neophyte like me. My secret is that I downloaded all their videos from the course and started watching it all over and over again if I don't get it in one shot, so even if the internet is down, I can continue learning and appreciate the incremental process of programming. You cannot beat around the bush when it comes to incremental coding because I know deep inside that a small mistake regarding indentation or even a lacking quotation mark will flop a Python program. Another thing is that some of my classmates are already experts in other fields of programming. Ahhhh! This one really floored me. The good thing is that you can ask about a certain topic and they'll answer with patience, and some answer with humor. The catch? I felt that their eyes were all over my project. They can easily tell the bluffs in my code. What I liked about the course is the fact that I didn't need to download any software, for there is an online-Python environment (CodeSkulptor) that I can make games with. The class forums were helpful, for there were times I was stuck in my mini-projects and several Community assistances and classmates came to answer my questions. Everyone had a chance to post their thoughts and their tips on how to complete a mini-project, and that's what spared my grades. I was not however, allowed to post working code of up to 10 lines, and that's part of the honor code which I somehow misunderstood. What I dislike is that I have to wait around several weeks or several days for your Statement of Accomplishment to arrive. That means that I have so many classmates taking the course, especially with Signature Track, and the teachers have to manually make sure that the student's photos and their typing verification, including mine, matched, which was a bit tedious.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60703</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-19</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Prior to taking this class I had not had any Python experience and I was able to follow the course through to completion. The instructors do a great job presenting the material in a way that non-programmers can understand.

I've had limited exposure to writing python programmes and this course greatly broadened my scope of knowledge in python. It didn't turn me into a seasoned programmer but I benefited enormously from it. For one I realised my codes are often too complicated, although they work they pose more difficulty in debugging and improving. Another being python's capability to build beautiful programmes with UI. For a long time I've only used python to write simple scripts and thought feature rich software is reserved for C++. Now I'm keen to continue building more programmes in python.

The Assignments were perfect, what I liked the most was the methodical way they were explained without giving away the answers. Pros: Fantastic program, nice way to learn python...you build a game at the end of it which is very gratifying. Cons: Its too addictive...you get hooked on to it, and wish this course was for another 8 weeks building more games....you don't want it to end :-) The only improvement that comes to my mind, is to get some sort of "find" ( like a Cntr-F" functionality in the CodeSkulptor, this will ease the programming in CodeSkulptor.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60678</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60677</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I found much more than I expected.

The browser based CodeSkultor was fantastic, as it allowed me to take my code wherever I wanted to (I edited it over lunch at work several times!) The class involved a fair amount of corny "professor" humor which lightened the mood for such an intensive subject. The only change I would like to see made is the inclusion of more optional components in the mini projects - something to really challenge quick learners or advanced students more, while not penalizing other students. Great class though!

I like miniprojects in this course. Every miniproject is a simple game which you need to implement. At the final you will create "Asteroids". Also I like possibility to write and execute python code inside browser. I think Codesculptor is key feature of this course. I like python manual within Codesculptor . I use it as a reference and after the course was ended. I would additionally highlighted part about using the debugger within Codesculptor.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60671</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Fantastic class. I've taken other Coursera classes and they were too remedial or the projects were just not fun. This class however is quite challenging but very rewarding. You're actually given the steps (pseudo code via straight English) to accomplish writing of your own games without given the full source code. It's fun and extremely educational. I never thought I'd be able to write my own Asteroid game but I did! I look forward to the next course from Rice and these same instructors.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60670</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-19</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60669</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60668</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I expected to learn the basics of Python and I truly believe I have.

I had hoped to get a bit of insight into some more "Pythonic" ways of approaching scripting in the class, as well as developing my (mostly non-existent) skills in interactive programming. The former goal - about being more "Pythonic" - was only partly achieved, but I think that was just due to the intended audience. The second goal - improving my interactive programming skills - got a good workout from this class. Overall, it was good fun, and it fostered a great community in the forums discussing the ins and outs of how to approach the various "mini-projects", and was where I probably got the most out of the class.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60661</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Didnt expect the course to be this challenging.

I must admit, it was not the first time I've taken this course, but it's only this time that I've finished it. I think this course might seem a bit too fast-paced for a complete beginner. Some assignments may be really time-taking. Still, it's quite realistic to complete this course and learn really helpful things. What's very important is that the course contains very instructive nice practice exercises, which help to digest new material and later implement it in either a course project or for your own needs. It's hard to say what I actually disliked. It's easier to say what, to my mind, could be improved. I think, the set of practice exercises could be extended. Also, it might be a good idea to add more information on further learning prospects at the end of the course. True, it's just the first part of a longer specialisation, but still, I think, it could provide a better vision of prospects and opportunities for those who are really new to programming.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60651</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Joe and Scott are fantastic teachers and gifted at conveying their passion for the subject while keeping the concepts clear and concise</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60650</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course content is quite comprehensive but I wish it had included the following bits: 1\. some object oriented design (a few simple examples related to some of the projects would do) 2\. use of inheritance or some other way to reuse code (for instance could the class Sprite have been a super class of Ship, i.e. making Ship a kind of "driven" Sprite as opposed to "timed" Sprite...or maybe I am talking nonsense?) 3\. using some IO methods to read configuration files (online) that could be used to define different initial conditions. As we are using CodeSkulptor it is not possible to open/close local files but some wrapper-class would have been used to fake that functionality. (just a thought) 4\. What about using some virtual appliance, this way everybody is in sync with applications, environmnet. I assume people that are taking this course are also capable of downloading and running a virtual machine.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60649</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60648</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-19</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60647</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I thought we would learn about standard Python gaming libraries. While the course uses a custom library for learning about GUI programming and interactive design, the libraries and concepts used in the course are still valuable. I have been able to take lessons that I learned in the course and transfer them over to learning about more standard Python libraries. Liked: Instructors - Every instructor for this course does an excellent job teaching. They make engaging videos and offer help and feedback through the forums. Assignments - The assignments offer enough of a challenge, but can be completed using the concepts from class. Tools - codeskultpor.org made completing work for this course easy. I could work on assignments from anywhere with web access. Disliked: Duration - I wish the course was longer and continued on to more in-depth topics. Would improve: I would cover more material during the course and maybe make some assignments slightly more challenging. The assignments have templates, which is useful, but I feel like students can learn more from having to start with less code.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60646</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-19</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60645</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Very nice course, the programming tips were fantastic!

My fundamental problem with this course is probably applicable to all online education, in that the feedback loop is slow and problematic when there are deadlines. Support based on the forum method are highly problematic as the quality of the posts vary in quality, and if the threat is poor, it will lead you further away from the correct solution. I think some sort of textbook would be helpful. Overall, good course and I learned a lot. However, there were some serious flaws that are endemic to online learning. For those who think this can be circumvented through meetup groups, I live across the river from NYC (i.e. a presumable large population of other codeskulpters) and it didn't meet up once. Relying on meetups as a form of study group is not reliable as it would be in theory. That being said, this is the best online programming course that I have been able to find.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60629</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-19</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60628</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60626</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I expected and I have learned how to program in Python.

My goal was to learn how to utilize python with a GUI interface. Improving my understanding of python while programing games was just a bonus. What did you like and dislike?Over thinking a problem that only requires a simple solution. The class gets you to think, and that is a good thing! What would you improve? The class feels polished, so this question is hard to answer. Also the Instructors actively updated quizzes when there was confusion with what was being asked. I would suggest as an improvment would be to increase the pool of questions that are used to generate the quizes. This way when retaking the quiz there are different questions. The number of questions is good. Making the student work for the correct answer is good. And having different questions each time a quiz is retaken I feel would bring a better barometer of the students understanging of the material.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60574</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The class material is great.

The focus on actually coding really well thought-out projects as the main means of learning was spot-on. The lectures and quizzes were well tailored to give you the knowledge base needed for the week's project. If you have more experience with programming, you might resent some of the hand-holding, but you probably shouldn't be taking this class then. OR, you still might enjoy yourself, since you build some pretty fun games (pong, asteroids, blackjack) as a part of the course!!! The material is mainly aimed towards building interactive applications (GUI's, games). This is not the direction I intend to take python programming in the future, but despite that mismatch, I still found this an excellent class, since it was actually fun to work on the projects. That means I was motivated to practice the basics of coding in python every week, meaning that after 8 weeks, I feel MUCH more comfortable and competent with python.

I liked that we programmed games because it was fun, but I wish we had also had the chance to write Web-based programs that were more typical of what would be required in the real world (e.g. business-type systems using databases). I liked most aspects of the class except the use of simplegui (which was OK, but it would have been helpful to have used a commercial package) and peer assessment. I understand the need for using both of these and would not expect them to change. What might be a good idea for future improvement is for at least one of the "peer" reviewers to be a TA who is experienced in Python. I have no concept of how many students were enrolled in the course, so this might not be practical if there were many. I would definitely recommend the course to anyone who has a programming background who wants to become conversant in Python. I would be hesitant to recommend the course to someone who has never programmed in any language before or to anyone who has difficulty understanding mathematics.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60568</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Good content, a great introduction to programming, the course has something for people in all levels.

So I used the time to learn the things by reading the docs and experimenting with CodeSculptor.

There is something good to see the finished product.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60533</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I have taken a lot of online courses and this is quite interesting because it is very funny and you see the results from the very beginning</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60532</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60531</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-18</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>1) I Expected to learn basics of programming using python and i think i learned a lot (was slow on projects but sorry for that will try to speed up next time) 2) i like the examples and demos and especially the codeskulptor and how it was designed with various examples and forums and videos 3) explanation for the Quizzes answers if u can do something about that Finally rest everything was superb it was really nice to learn new things</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60530</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I expected to learn Python, which the course taught me in a very simple way. The fun part of the class was that we were applying simple Python codes to make fun games. In this process not only we grew as Python programmers but we also got an insight into how games are built. The course was so entertaining that I couldn't wait for the next week's material to be uploaded and start working on the project. I have completely enjoyed my process of learning Python and building games for the past 2 months. I would highly recommend this course to anyone who has the will to learn Python or how to build games. This course is guaranteed to give you'll a very good learning exposure and fun learning.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60529</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60528</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-18</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I really loved the first 3/4 of the class. It moved at a nice, even pace and, while challenging, was still very understandable. Once we got into objects, however, it was really hard to keep up. I would have liked some sort of textbook or better handouts to help with understanding things. If I wanted to teach myself with Python docs, I would've done so. The documentation for Code Skulptor was really good, but, again, didn't do much to teach concepts.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60527</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I expected to learn the concepts of object oriented programming in python and that's exactly what I learned. While it would be possible to learn this writing boring programs - this class teaches OOP using small games... It was fun! I disliked .... hmm... I really didn't dislike anything about the class. The only thing I would like to see improved (if it could be) would be file handling in CodeSkulptor. When the class was done I had a huge number of saved links - each a different version of the games I had worked on for the class. It would be really nice if there was a login page where you could save the files.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60526</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I expected to learn and get used to programming in python on basic level and i feel like I accomplished that and some more.

The content was very good for a beginner's course. I already knew some Python but I considered working through even the most basic stuff a useful exercise. At times, I felt that the project templates perhaps provided too much help making the project feel a bit too easy but as some of the students perhaps didn't have the programming background, this was perhaps necessary. A follow-up course perhaps by using some existing library like PyGame, Cocos2d or similar would be very interesting.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60522</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-18</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60520</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I liked making a little project every week.

I have converted the programs that we developed online down to my local laptop and have continued to work on them, making improvements and tweaking them. I was surprised at the range of experience of students in the class (from just beginning to experienced developers who were looking to learn a new language) and how helpful everyone was to each other in figuring problems or understanding concepts. It felt very friendly and supportive all the way around from the students up to the professors. I would definitely take more courses from these guys whether they were in my career path or not, just because they made learning something new very fun and easy to do.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60515</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I am impressed that I finished the course and have done all the quizzes and the mini-projects! I have to say that I can't accomplish this without the well explained lecture and the help from our TA. Some of the mini-projects were very difficult. I think it would be better to have some more time in between some projects. So that we can get to absorb the knowledge properly instead of looking up the definition of the functions while I'm trying to implement the game in the projects. Saying so, it might just be me not be able to absorb the concepts well because I didn't put enough time into it. I'll have to watch the lectures more even the course is finished now. It definitely was a great experience taking this course!

I strongly recommend that you start here if you have never programmed before. They know that most students don't have prior experience in programming, so they organized the course in a very didactic and enjoyable manner. While learning to program, you also get to see what can be achieved in Python, and you have LOTS amounts of fun doing it. I think that teaching through the process of making games was a fantastic idea. It makes you really get into it and try different ways to face the challenges, and you learn way more doing so. Also, the teachers are excellent, they cover everything and interact with the students in a way I have never seen in a MOOC. It made the class seem a lot more personal and not as formal as they usually are elsewhere. I loved all the competitive gaming and betting between Scott and Joe, it was very fun and a great addition to the course. Thanks for everything guys, I started without knowing what an "if" clause is, and now I can design the game "Asteroids". Again, I strongly recommend this course for anyone that wants to learn to program in a really enjoyable way.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60491</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Learned event-driven and object-oriented programming.

If getting stuck on something, the forums are very useful and both co-students and TAs are very helpful to keep you going into right direction. The programming assignments (mini-projects) were focusing on programming some interactive apps and tools which was fun to work on and it was also interesting to review and assess the work of the co-students. Personally I would have liked to also do a bit of text and file parsing and manipulating such data, but for the rest a lot of different aspects of scripting and programming in Python has been taught. I would highly recommend this class if you are looking to get some hands on interactive programming!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60459</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I expect to learn the key points, the philosophy of python programming.

I would've prefer more focus on OOP. Some how-tos on writing classes.

We can use codeskulptor as a tool to debug code but not THE tool to both write code and debug it. The codeskulptor is a great tool and made my life much easier but it also have disadvantages of not learning things as we might in real life. The course overall seemed easy, may be due to my CS background. I do not know if it taught me everything I need to learn about programming in Python. The course was too focus on getting graphical interface going which is not bad but some other real like examples such as writing a script would have been a great addition to the course. Also, I was hoping for some exposure to recursive calls etc. but I guess those are left to advance course. But overall great course.

I was able to complete the first couple projects relatively quickly and with relatively little difficulty. But things did get challenging about 4 weeks in and I found that the amount of time I had to invest was considerably greater than I anticipated. when I signed up. In the end, this wasn't a bad thing...it's good to be challenged but those that are thinking this is commitment of just a few hours a week may end up getting surprised!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60395</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I expected to learn Python and to write a simple video game. I learned perhaps a simplified version of Python suitable for a beginner, but the games we learned to write were actually more complex and fun than I had expected. There was nothing I didn't like about this class. Even the schedule was well organized. Projects were due on the weekend but lectures, quizzes and so on were available far enough in advance that I was able to complete everything during the week and therefore go away on weekends for some previously planned trips. Similarly the grading was due on Wednesday morning so I was able to get back from even a three day weekend and still complete the required peer grading.

Liked all things mentioned above like codeskulptor, videos, exercises and forums. The guys did a really great job in their explanations and threw in some banter and joking around as well. I would include some marking to be included for game playability - sometimes students mini project games were difficult to play/unplayable but the fixed rubric meant they scored 100%. I would like to be able to give someone with a perfect game a better score than someone who's game is unplayable. Apart from that, a really great course and highly recommended for learning the basics.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60391</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>As a beginner, I find this class very tough. I spent almost 24 hours to finish each miniproject from week 5 onwards. To "perfect" the quizzes, I spent about 1 hr per quizz, and more for the quizz on building class. Even though I have not expected to spend so much time, I really enjoyed the video classes and the discussion forum . I think the class material is very well organized and well thought. In my opinion, Codeskulptor really accelerates the programming in Python learning experience. I'm planning to write some simple games from the skills I've learned from this course. I hope that I'll be advanced enough to transition to using the actual Python program. The Introduction to Python team is very creative in structuring their quizzes and projects to affirm what you have learned in the class videos. I also enjoy the video tutorial competition very much. I'm not advanced enough to make and give a tutorial but I've learned so much just by watching them. Credits to the course creators and team who have come up with this idea. Great work! Great course! For those of you who have no programming experience like me, if you are willing to spend the time, don't hesitate to join this course! If I can do it, you can! Thank you, Introduction to Python team!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60390</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course was perfect....

I never programmed with GUI before (only behind the scenes data processing stuff well and internet stuff which does have an interface although very different in implementation). I've also never programmed games before so it was a different way of thinking and I really enjoyed the math part of the course as calculating financial information math is very different so this was fun for me. What I didn't like a small part of is the self-assessment process. It was often without comments from other students and I suspect most students didn't look at the code, only the final implementation. So for example I noticed after I submitted my code where I mistakenly updated my draw functions more than once per cycle. I still had normal gameplay because I adjusted my constants to make everything work well. But no one noticed. I also made heavy use of John's list comprehension (filtered and computational) to reduce the amount of code and duplicate code. Based on the lack of comments I don't even think people looked at the code. I think if grade was based on at least one question per assignment having us look for something in the code that once we were there looking we'd learn even more things. I don't know if Coursrea could handle a non-point awarding questions but even asking a simple question of how many lines of code without comments did the program have would force us to look at people's code. Our own natural curiosity would have us looking more deeply if one person's code is 100 lines more (or less) to see why that is. I would say I'm an advanced programmer and I still learned lots by looking at other's code so was a little disappointed when most my assessments came back with no meaningful comments.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60386</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course is gradually getting harder close to the end.

You will learn how to program in Python 2.6 interactive apps, event driving concept. basic data types and operations. cons; It has Math. Personally I hate math and everything related (e.g. geometry). It has it a LOT. I spent nights solving geometry physics problems in this course, instead of learning real python! :( They should replace math with coverage of basic python API and programming paradigms , PATTERNS!

I was expecting some exploration of the Raspberry Pi project and anything similar. I also was expecting some information as to why python - is it popular in a specific industry - what are its advantages over other languages?

Building functioning games to teach the correct syntax, structure and concepts of Python is a great way to keep students engaged in the material. I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in getting started with Python. My only minor complaint was that week 4 is pretty stressful to complete within the time-frame given. I easily put in 3 to 4 hours per day the entire week towards the material in week 4. I also work full time so that's basically every night after work. Blackjack introduced new concepts that I really struggled to get working in my mini-project. I relied heavily on the forums to get the project completed and I literally finished it about 30 minutes before the deadline. That being said I did get it working and the remaining projects were not as difficult in week's 5 and 6. Great class, two thumbs up. :)</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60333</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60332</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-17</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I took this course as an entry point to python, and I'm very satisfied with the experience.

I think the course is suitable for beginners as well as more advanced programmers. Although it was presented with enough detail that a beginner would be able to understand the content, I rarely felt like I skipping over content because it was too elementary for me, even though I am a professional programmer.

What I like is that they developed our understanding of Object Oriented Programming and our skills in how to approach programming tasks in general.

Plus, they clearly care about and enjoy what they are doing and that comes through in the videos. And, they have a quirky sense of humor which is fun to watch.

The class taught the basics of Python very well, and the focus on games made the projects we made extra interesting. The difficulty was perfect for me; I've dabbled in programming before, but I've never taken a structured course in Python. The instruction was clear and useful, and the quizzes and projects were just difficult enough that we had to put real thought into them, but well-explained so they didn't become frustrating. I do wish we had more of a chance to get our code itself peer-reviewed instead of just the final product, but the limits of a MOOC make that difficult.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60295</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>So much of learning how to code, is to just code.

The course is very well structured and challenges you just enough to make you break a sweat at the same time betters your programming thought process.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60282</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Amazing class. 10/10</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60281</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I expected to learn some more basic stuff that I've overseen while just picking up the language 4-5 years ago. It gave me a lot more than just some basics, and I have discovered a whole new power to Python. I liked everything, and the only thing I would improve if I had the right wand, was to make a part two with more stuff. I could watch these guys for a long time, being entertained while learning cool stuff.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60280</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I expected to learn how to program using python.

The lectures were excellent, the mini-projects were enjoyable and just the right level of challenging and do-able if you follow the lectures and the templates and instructions. The documentation, forums, and extra materials (exercises, sample programs) were also excellent - there when you needed them, but out of the way when you didn't.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60278</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>A big thank you to the instructors, staff and my peers of this class. The course had very good lectures, projects and a very prompt discussion forum(I haven't seen these many threads / quick response time in other courses). This is one course to date that I learned just because it was so FUN!! I started one week late, missed first mini-project deadline but was still able to complete rest of the course successfully - thanks to the great lectures and reading materials! Looking forward to next set of courses from these instructors!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60277</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I think I learned more than expected - I have done Python courses for beginners before, so I expected this course to be more of the same (I did it mainly for the practice). But I learned a lot of useful things that I didn't know before, not only about Python itself, but also object-oriented programming. CodeSculptor, the browser-based programming environment used in the course, made learning basics a lot more fun than it usually is. Great kudos to Scott for creating it and to John for making the documentation so easy to navigate and read. I hope CodeSkulptor will be up and developed in the future! The peer assessment was another very nice thing about this course. I could compare my code and solutions to those written by others. I could also learn how different it is to debug someone else's code comparing to debugging your own, and some design decisions and standards make a lot more sense now. I shouldn't forget, of course, to mention the valuable feedback that I have received from my peers. I would perhaps make quizzes and self-assessment optional rather than obligatory (for such practical skills as programming), but that's just an idea. Overall, thank you very much, lecturers and all the people more or less directly involved in creating this course!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60276</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>the base of python</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60275</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The 'CodeSkulptor' web programming framework was the 'candy' that got me to take this course. Great Job! I expected to learn game programming principles and implementation in python. I got all of that and even learned some things about python I had been able to avoid until now. Thank you also for doing some of the 'heavy lifting' in the later projects. I think I could have figured out how to do the whole thing, but learning to use the objects you provided instead of my own was quite instructive. It also made it feasible to finish the projects in the time given. The only improvement I would suggest would be more demonstrations of how to use the CodeSkulptor Viz mode to do troubleshooting in the more complicated projects later in the course would be helpful (it become quite busy and hard to follow) for me. I would also like more information on transitioning beyond Code Skulptor. Scott gave some good pointers in the post-class video, but one or two examples of transitioning to a different GUI could be helpful. However I now feel confident to take on that challenge for myself. I could be 'dangerous'!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60274</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-17</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Basic Python Quizzes Quizzes</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60273</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Throughout the course, many concepts were introduced stepwise in a very elegant way.

As someone with a lot of programming experience and a year or so of Python use, I have to say that it fell short of that. Complete beginners to programming would have found the pace too quick and the breadth to which Python was explained was too narrow. However, as a beginners course in event-driven programming, it was absolutely superb - I learned a lot and enjoyed the course immensely. In view of the mismatch between my expectations and what was delivered, I have decided to grade the course content on what was provided - hence the five stars.

Granted, with this being more of an entry- level course, there is a ways yet to go. I liked the pace of the class and in some parts, I though it could have been sped up a little bit, particularly in the beginning. After completing the course, the content was fantastic, lectures were engaging. One thing that I would like to see in future classes would be in addition to a mini-project each week, there is an overall project to be completed as well. It needs to be separate from the mini-projects, but the concepts learned that week could be applied. I believe that would assist the students in getting used to development is not an overnight process.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60226</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Great course.

To mention something, I would like if they might improve the simpleGUI module.

The best part i like is miniproject. It provides us with a good chance to share and review our programs. Comments from peers are encouraging, especially when you get complimentary feedback. The materials are not comperhensive but rather practical. It teaches gui programming very early so students can quickly write interesting codes at the beginning. The course provides you with a basic online ide called codeskluptor. It's both easy and powerful to beginners. It's an awesome tool for python learner. The only problem is that it doesn't support python 3 and I think instead of python 2, python 3 is a better choice to start with.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60203</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60202</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Thank you!

The instructors are great and they really make you feel as if you were in a real class. The lessons are never boring, they always manage to keep your attention focused on the each subject they teach and challenge you to understand it on your own with useful exercises. Codeskulptor is great and allows you to develop your programs, debug and run them using a web browser! It's one of the most valuable thing that this course offers to beginners. During the course they offer programming tips, examples and quizzes that really help understanding the concepts and developing your skills a week after the other. I was amazed on how quickly I managed to write more and more complex codes. You start with a few lines code and you end up with a hundred of lines or even more. I must also say that I remembered object programming as a very difficult topic from school, however this course explains it so well that you realize how powerful and great this programming style is. The peer's evaluation and self review are really helpful and let you understand how other students dealt with the week's mini project, and challenge you to review and evaluate your work after that. I must say this is an exceptional course that I would recommend to everyone, beginners as well as advanced programmers that wants to Python, object oriented programming and GUI based programming.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60178</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60177</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The lessons were fun and everything was well explained.

The assignments were fun and enjoyable enough that they didn't really seem like a chore that i had to complete, but more like a fun challenge that made me feel a great sense of accomplishment when done. I had expected to brush up on concepts that i was weak on, and learn new techniques for doing things. The course certainly gave me the opportunity to brush up my skills, and made me aware of programming techniques that are useful, along with techniques to avoid. It introduced me to event driven programming which is coming in useful in other programming projects i have played around with outside of class. I absolutely loved this class. Teachers were awesome, content was great, it was a lot of fun. I would definitely recommenced this to any one starting out programming, or people with some existing experience but wanting to polish up their programming skills.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60175</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course content was brilliant! Learning Python by programming simple and gradually more complicated games works very well. As a student I was very motivated to complete a game and see it work and be played. The course is not easy but it can be completed in the required time - as a complete beginner in Python I spent about 8 hours/week on it most weeks - more on the week that introduced Object Orientated Programming and less in the earlier weeks. Everything you need is included and the exercises and quizzes require you to use the provided documentation which is a good skill to acquire anyway.

Although this course was pretty elementary from a technical standpoint (as was intended), I found it valuable for getting some actual hands-on experience, and I feel that it really helped me to take up my next goal, which is to learn some of the data analytics frameworks such as pandas and ipython notebooks, as a substitute for R. Besides, it was just fun. One thing the course doesn't really address, but that might be a useful thing to work in somehow, is file I/O - just reading and writing simple text files. Maybe a chapter on saving/serializing the state of a game that can then be reloaded and restarted later. Not sure how that would work in the CodeSkulptor environment though.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60155</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>It's been brilliant.

I started from zero and learned a lot. English is not my native language, but apart from a few small translaton- problems, it was easy to understand, what the teachers said. (the words, not allways the meanings! ;) ) The level of this course is high, but not to hard. They teach you all you need to know to do the next assigment/game, but you have to figure it out by yourself in detail. Learning by doing, try and error.... the best way to understand. We all learned that way, when we were babies and tried to walk and speak and eat and so on.. So BIG THANKS to all the teachers there. Well done!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60152</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>After many years of hanging out in web server side (ASP/PHP/Javascript) I've decided to return to the basics and learn Python.

Additionally, codeskulptor.org was used to make writing code easier. The only critique is that codeskulptor may not be as familiar to those with some python background and could take some adjusting. I took this class hoping that I would gain a background into the general principles of programming so that I could continue learning on my own. In the meantime, I fell in love with Python and programming in general. If you have any reason to explore programming or Python, this course is fun and moves at a great pace. Give it a shot.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60146</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I expected to learn just the basics of python programming and boy was I wrong.

The interesting part of the classes are the mini projects. They are covered in most of the videos. Those projects are very rewarding. The quiz of each weeks help to understand python better. And the programming tips are very helpful. There could be more challenge on mini projects. Instead of giving hints on every single steps, some extra thoughts could be exposed without too many details.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60117</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I learned a lot from this course.

It uses crowd- sourced grading where you have to evaluate if the anonymous submission completed the point. It only focuses on results and completely ignores the code. So you could be writing terrible code that works and not really learning anything about how to get better. There should be some impetus on the graders to actually look at the code and evaluate the style and efficiency.\ Overall, it's a good class but the lack of rigorous grading leaves something to be desired.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60113</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Very great!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60112</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60111</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60110</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I think this course had provided me strong foundation of python programming language and strong confidence in writing one.

I finished the class a couple days ago and all I can say is: "WOW! Take this class!" At the beginning, the class requires no background knowledge. You start in baby steps and by the end of Week 7, you are running marathons, so to speak. In other words, don't be scared to take the class because you think to yourself "Oh, I'm just not good with computers". Trust me, the instructors and the structure of the course allow for everyone to get involved. The games that you create are really fun to both build and play. This conscious decision to create games as programming assignments is really what allows so many students to feel engaged. The next time this class is offered, don't miss out. You'll love it. Difficulty: Beginning-Intermediate Hours/wk: First 2 weeks: 3hr/wk; Week3-7: 6-9hr/wk The only thing I would potentially change is introducing objected oriented programming a week earlier as to allow the class to touch on a few more OOP idioms.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60104</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-16</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Expected an introduction to python, basic fundamental programming concepts- received all that and more.

I liked that a different, but fully functional game was produced with each module so you could see a completed project each week. The step by step instructions on how to build the solution was often very useful, but I found it was easy to rely on this; and such a thing would not be available if I was building something from scratch myself. So perhaps there should be three levels of instruction with various levels of detail or guidance where students could first try the limited instruction, but then have access to the others as needed. It was very useful to grade other students work, so that you were able to see differences in coding approaches and solutions to the same problem.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60101</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I expected to learn about the basics of programming.

I liked the lectures on video because I could easily replay the parts that I had trouble understanding. I liked having quizes approximately twice per week with a suggested 'soft' deadline. This helped keep me on track. I liked having the the Practice Exercises which helped me better understand the topics for that week before working on the mini-projects. Having templates to start out with for the mini projects worked great. I especially liked the development instructions for each mini-project because it helped me to understand how starting out writing smaller pieces of the code first, testing it, then adding to it, and testing that, etc. The CodeSkulptor tool is fantastic!! it definitely helped in the learning process. It made it easy to start out programming without worrying about installing and setting up Python on my computer. Improvements: I am very happy with this class, Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python. I don't have any suggestions for improvement. It has been a positive experience that I highly recommend to others who want to learn about Python.

Works on multiple levels as an intro to any and all of programming, interactive programming and the Python language. Huge class size, but all the other students I dealt with were very friendly. Programming frameworks for every assignment were given, so nothing was from scratch, and enough hints and directions were provided from the course and forums to enable completing the program each week. Sept-Nov course timing was not so good for a student in the Southern Hemisphere since the course interposed on final exams and assignments, but the time requirements were not so demanding as to dis-allow some time-juggling. Highly recommended.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60092</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I like it a lot, I learned more than I expected and only for an introductory course its almost perfect</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60091</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-16</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Some of the videos seem to be from a previous session, and their information did not address the specific project needs.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60090</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-16</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>I like all the course material.

I think this course can meet the needs of many levels of student, but I would highly recommend for beginner students because the quality of instruction in this course is excellent and not always found in other courses. I expected to learn some more Python language. The exposure to GUI game programming was more of a curiosity then necessity for my career needs. I course was successful in meeting both my objectives. Things I really appreciated about some of the instructors and feel should not go unnoted: Joe Warren brought a real personal touch to the course which is particularly important in a MOOC; his humor and passion for the course was inspiring! Scott Rixner has an wonderful ability to convey technical material in an easily understandable manner; he is the type of instructor you want teaching all my courses. Suggestion: adding another 1-2 weeks of application of the "beyond CodeSkulptor" concept. For example, taking a project and modifying/enhancing it further using one of the eternal GUI python libraries outside of CS tool. Understandably this can be a self motivated exercise, however it might facilitate the "transition" if Joe and Scott provided a few video insightful lectures and mini-project as illustration to students.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60074</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I had zero programming experience before this course and just 8 weeks later I'm confident about my programming skills in Python and have even used these newly acquired skills a few times outside the class.

To me one improvement would be to take a little longer on the first project in which object-oriented programming is used. For those of us with some previous programming experience from back in the dark ages, OOP is quite a shift, and learning how to do what you could so easily do using non-OOP methods takes a bit of time.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60057</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I wanted to learn python, and I learned a lot.

I thought it sounded interesting and I was right. It turned out to be very interesting, fun and challenging. I liked using the things I learned each week to build some sort of game. It helps keep thing interesting and light hearted. One thing I had a hard time with was the schedule. The first few weeks were not too bad, but the last 4-5 weeks were tough getting things done on time. Not that they were that hard, just tough to keep on schedule. Not much time for "exploring" and practice. I guess I would stretch it out for a few more weeks and allow for more practice (like the week on classes).</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60053</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>learned a lot!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60052</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60050</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60049</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I expected to learn the VERY basics of programming with python, but I learned SOO MUCH MORE!!

I attempted to look for additional classes to enroll in through Coursera since I liked this one so much, and could not find anything that compared even REMOTELY to this class!! It was seriously just soo well done. I am very happy with the course and my time here.

I had not expected to be able to complete a game by the time I was done (albeit a simple one), and I didn't expect so many aspects of programming to be not only covered but covered extremely well. The concepts were well covered, and the instructors kept it interesting throughout. I found the pacing of the course to be perfect (provided you keep up week to week, I can see people getting a little overwhelmed if they were to fall behind at any stage). The amount of work to complete each week was challenging (keeping in mind I work full time) but always achievable. Add to that the content would consistently expand on concepts taught in previous weeks as well as covering new ground, which served to solidify my understanding of thee concepts whilst still making progress.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>60032</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course gave an introduction to the subject, as I expected.

The video lectures are short and to the point. The quizzes, there are a couple of them every week, are also short and not very difficult. The weekly Mini projects are more demanding but a fantastic learning experience. One of the things I liked best was the incredible documentation available. When you don't have much experience programming it's really helpful to be able to look up your doubts and find clear explanations and plenty of examples. Another great thing about the course was the Forums, a real lifesaver, when you're struggling you can always find a lot of help there.

I had taken a couple classes before this one. The first was very algorithm focused and frankly very challenging with a three hour final exam that I didn't have time to complete. Too abstract. The second was an extremely gentle introduction to everything from data-structures to algorithms to web scraping, but was a bit too slow. Too simplistic. So I still needed something else... This class delivered. It was faster paced and didn't go into excruciating detail about every command keyword and the history of computing, etc. Instead it more or less gave me the impression that I was taking a real class online for a real grade taught at the pace of a true course. It was truly hard at times but I was able to pull through and the struggle made me a better programmer and problem solver, I feel. As for dislikes, I'm not sure. The forums crowd seemed lively, and got much livelier and more diverse when we got to graphical game making, but at first they seemed a little daunting because the only prolific posters were complete beginners who needed help from the established crowd of professional programmers /those who knew Python already but wanted to learn event driven programming. As for improvements, I'm not sure. Codeskulptor is amazing and seems very smart. Hey - I can just write some python in my browser and throw up a GUI for it anywhere without having to install python and cloud save the files for later use. Thank you for that! But the downside is I now have to learn to use all the third party libraries. It would be nice if someone could show us how to create a frame or something extremely basic using his package of choice (like Pygame or Tkinter). That would make the lighbulb go off for sure.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>59979</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I expected to learn Python fundamentals, and this course exceeded my expectations.

The CodeSkulptor environment used for the course is an excellent teaching tool/resource. So well done Rice and Scott. I enjoyed the weekly quizzes and assignments. The quizzes were multi-choice, but that belies hidden depth - some of the questions required you to write programs to solve the problem. That meant you had tested yourself thoroughly on the week's material before tacking the project. The projects were great - we produced surprisingly sophisticated programs for a course suitable for beginners to programming. I can't think of anything obvious that needs improving. Perhaps just add a follow on course for improving Python programmers, with new challenges?!

The course materials were outstanding, and the instructors did a terrific job of tying together the lectures, practice exercises, and assignments - it was a very integrated whole - a much better job than other programming classes I took as an undergrad, where theory (lecture) and practice (homework) could be quite far apart. You can tell how much thought and work went into putting together this course. For Python and and other programming topic, there is so much information out there, it's hard to make sense of it all or know where to begin. The greatest value of this class was the structure it provided to get through a large amount of learning at in an organized, consistent way.

How to install SimpleGuiTK and view CodeSkulptor code actually working. Maybe even some samples using Tkinter that did the same thing as the course assignments.

However this course steered away from abstract uses of features of the Python programming language, but instead quickly moved into making working games - simple ones to start with - which were gradually built upon. Concepts were introduced in the context of completing that week's assignment, rather than just something to learn, which meant we quickly reached a position of making graphical games which worked, and could be customised to some extent. After 8 weeks, the final game is quite something - although some of the detail was provided to enable the student to concentrate on the concepts to be learned without getting bogged down in some implementation details. I liked the quality of the videos which - if you watched carefully and took your own notes, provided nearly all the information needed to complete the quizzes and assignment for that week. I liked the element of humour in the rivalry between Joe and Scott, which showed how the assignment should work but in a fun way. I liked the way that John showed us novices how to debug our code when simple print statements were not sufficient to figure out what is going on - especially the need to look for unexpected mutation (when two variables become the same entity). What did I dislike? Nothing. Improvements? Hard to see anything obvious. The quality of the course materials were of such a high standard, but put together in a simple and easy to understand way, that if you did the work then you got the outcome, maybe with a little help from your peers or the code clinic along the way. I think the course walked the tightrope of meeting the needs of a vast range of abilities (and first languages) with finesse and struck the bullseye.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>59932</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>59931</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>59930</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I was hoping to learn how to code well in Python because I'm teaching a Python class at our homeschool co-op to a small group of 14 year old boys, including my son. This class definitely helped achieve that goal, and I got to send them a link to my final version of Rice Rocks last night which I know they're going to love. I was also hoping to learn about event driven programming and classes and objects, since I studied neither in college, nor have I used either in any of my jobs as a programmer. This class definitely accomplished that and I am very appreciative. I think you all are excellent instructors. You taught the material very well. I also really appreciated the templates and the level of care and detail in making sure we had the information we needed to be successful and finish the assignments. I trusted that you wouldn't leave us hanging and that you would give us the information we needed to be able to write the code. I loved that we just had to fill in the pieces so we could create all the awesome games you had for the miniprojects. It was very motivational. I had a lot of fun in this class, and although I'll be glad to have the extra time now that the class is over, I'm definitely sad to see it end. Thank you Joe and Scott for all the time and effort you obviously put into the class to make it such a great success and thank you John for all your programming tips.

I'm really happy about that. I had already tried a bit of pygame. Codeskulptor provides a nice simple interface for the same sort of thing. I liked the debugging help that Codeskulptor offers (Viz mode) but the windows and lines get too busy as you add functions. I also liked the mini-project series. The projects form a nice progression and build your knowledge. I also liked the forums and I especially liked the code clinic where you could get hints from the staff when you got stuck. Improvements: One minor one; Codeskulptor needs a print button (print with line numbers). It would also be helpful to add a video on flowcharting along with some advice on keeping our approaches to coding organized. Maybe, along with the flowcharting, a video on program design (especially OOP based programs) would help.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>59923</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I've expected to understand PYTHON programming language better to incorporate it it into my work.

Though there was no beginning date, I felt pretty excited about the idea of studying in this class. So I clicked, that "follow" button, and went on searching for Python stuff. I got an e-mail back in September, notifying that the course is about to start. By that time I've already gained a little experience in Python, and I got some concerns about this class, due to lack of time and some minor problems, but I decided like, lets give it a crack. There was not a single minute that I would regret about that decision. It was a terrific experience. It felt like I'm one of many of those who are keen on getting the joy of programming. It was really fun to learn new things and to assess my classmates. Special thanks to the teachers of this class. They've done an enormous amount of work that I think all of the students highly appreciate. All of them are kind and stimulating, it's been a pleasure to view all the lectures they made. To sum this up, no matter whether you are new to programming or you had some experience already, this is a great way to learn new things, especially if you are eager to start programming in Python.

I think it might be good to give suggestions of ideas for more projects.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>59909</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>59908</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>59907</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I expected to learn how to program in Python and I believe this succeeded! :-) I would very much like to practice more on my logic and problem and solution definitions. I now know how to program but (sometimes) my logic is falling short. I am hoping that the upcoming courses of the specialization track 'Fundamentals of computing' and additional practice will address this. I also have appreciated Codeskulptor (codeskulptor.org) and Codeskulptor Viz a lot because I you only spend time on things that really matter, have a great tool to troubleshoot your code and have a easy way to show your code to others.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>59906</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The instructors and the way they organized this course made the learning fun and more effective.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>59905</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>59904</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I've learned more than I expected; I like how we could use codeskulptor to do the mini-projects so that way it was easy to access it from anywhere.

The mini projects - remaking existing games - are nice, although perhaps hold your hand a bit too much. They rarely ask you to make any real design decisions on the structure of your code, which is mostly given. Codeskulptor, the environment used, does what it says on the can: a fully functional and easy to use web environment. I prefer a more fully featured IDE (I used Spyder a bit), f.e. with autocomplete based on method signatures, but for the goal of the course that's really not needed and might even be a bad thing if it keeps people from looking up more information in the documentation.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>59899</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>59898</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I expected to learn the basics of Python.

While I already knew the design piece, python was a completely new subject for me, and I had not done much event-driven programming as is used in the games in this course. The provided online Python interpreter made for an easy entry point and the assignments were very well broken down so someone new to programming could just follow the steps. The quizzes were harder than in other courses I've taken - these instructors want you to get comfortable experimenting in code to answer questions, rather than memorize how every command works. Plan for more time than you think it will take to do the quizzes. There are also practice exercises offered. If you haven't programmed before, looking at these will be helpful, but again - they take time. The mini-projects (due weekly) are fun to build. You are given a template from which to start and step-by-step instructions on which parts to implement and test before moving to the next step. The games increase in complexity and week 8's game builds on week 7's. In the beginning, the games are simple text. In the end, you are building blackjack and asteroids. The forums (for support) are great too. There are always people on - other students, TA's, even the instructors themselves are an active presence here, and the forums are divided out well enough that it's easy to find what you're looking for. The instructors take what is typically a dry subject and make it fun with a playful teaching style and approach to coding. Fantastic course - I highly recommend it. I learned lots and had a blast and now my 9yo son wants to take it!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>34553</review_data_id><review_date>2014-06-02</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>Prior experience with programming: some. I've written simple procedural tools at work for mathematical conversion, etc. On the plus side, the projects almost always were some form of computer game. For the 70% of people who play computer games, this made it a very accessible course. For the 30% of us that have never enjoyed computer games, it was actually a pretty big setback. The big negative is this: ALL the information content is in the videos. There are, in theory, transcripts from the videos, but it's clear they were created by an audio speech-to-text translation program that did a horrible job. You end up with NO WAY to reference items you may or may not have learned. This course BADLY needs a textbook or summary of the information in the videos. The provided "Concepts and Examples" section is pretty good, but, not organized into sensible elements and not useful as a reference. In the first half of the course, the videos are pretty straightforward, information is provided - although without much explanation that frames it. "Do this" rather than "when you do this, you are implementing what is known as...." The instructors get punch-drunk after the first half, and the percentage of the video that contains mostly self-serving jokes begins to rise, until the very last video "summary", which is five minutes basically, of two profs saying "this was a lot of work for us to do, aren't we great!" If you have no programming experience, figure 30-35 hours a week. If you have a LOT of programming experience, figure 15-20 hours (a bunch of us at work took the course together, and the most seasoned programmers in our midst still say it took a lot of time). If you have the time, it's a good class. I stashed all the videos for later review, as well as quizzes and homeworks, and I'll finish it as I have the time. And I will write my own reference book from the videos.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>34028</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-31</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course is excellent!

Completing these projects though would not be possible without all the materials and guidance that have been provided by organizators, forum discussions, step by step descriptions for projects, great teachers, TAs, tutorials and support from other students. The load of work that these people have done is amazing. I absolutely recommend and say thanks to all who worked on this!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33950</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-30</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Great class for begginers!

I started with little knowledge about programming and completed this course with a feeling of accomplishment. The teachers are awesome, every week they teach you what you need to know to complete your assignment. If you follow the progression listening to the videos, doing the quizzes and doing mini projects, you will be able to meet the challenge of completing the project every week. There is help out there on discussion forums too. Over all I am happy that I learned so much and able to move forward from here.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33943</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Excellent class to introduce Python and programming in general.

(I would highly recommend preparing prior to the start of class with a self-paced Python learning site such as codecademy.com). The professors taught with a sense of humor and understanding for all levels of students. It was wonderful to be a part of a global community of students who helped each other through discussion forums and posted their own wonderfully inspired videos to explain concepts. Knowing tens of thousands of classmates would be asking for individual help through the email Code Clinic, I was amazed and astonished how quickly the dedicated TA's would get back to me with help and encouragement. I've taken 2 other Coursera classes and this one had the best professors/videos, specialized application (CodeSkulptor/Viz Mode), projects, and camaraderie. In today's world everyone should learn how to code.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33928</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This was my first experience with programming and with an online course.

After 8 weeks, however, I was able to program some cool games. Instructors are very passionate about what they are doing and have put so much effort in making the class interesting. The whole course is well organized with video lectures, quizzes, practice exercises, and weekly projects where you really get the chance to put in practice what you learned. The discussion forum is very active and support from peers is encouraging. The central piece of the entire course is CodeSkulptor (www.codeskulptor.org), which allows to run Python code directly from the web in a very convenient way. A simple web address is the only thing your friends and family will need to run your cool games. Instructors and TAs have put a lot of effort and time to bring up this course to the level of quality it is today, and besides the interesting topics being discussed, the instructors can make some funny jokes too. My time was well spent in completing the course. Highly recommended for those looking to start with Python!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33909</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Great course!!! My prior experience with the Python was "0". I only had a small experience with Pascal and C in university.

I was once on the faculty at CUNY, Dept. of Computer Science and have years of teaching experience. This class was very well conceived and executed, particularly in light of the difficulties inherent to online training where there are thousands of students enrolled. Scott Rixner, Joe Warren, John Greiner, and Steven Wong have done a fine job and I am confident that with time this class stands only to improve. They have gone the extra mile to make Python coding accessible to those with zero experience and I daresay that this must have made a huge difference to many of the students. As training paradigms expand outward from the classroom and into people's homes and offices, the work of people like Scott and Joe becomes increasingly significant in its impact on the lives of growing numbers of students who would not have been able to undertake such learning otherwise. It is my hope that their colleagues, including administrators, will take heed of the words of a man who has been in the businesses of both professional development, R&amp;D;, and classroom teaching and examine what is happening at Rice with an open mind and an eye to the future. I can see only good coming of this.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33876</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-28</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I used to program in 'C' for my job, but have not done any hardcore programming in about a decade.

The professors taught the course well. Each week, for nine weeks, the course consisted of three parts: watching a series of lectures, taking two quizzes, and completing a mini- project (coding increasingly more complex games). The lectures were well- organized, the quizzes relevant, and the mini-projects challenging but not too daunting. Moreover, code templates for each project helped me a lot in successfully completing it. The class was fun. It made learning Python and interactive programming enjoyable. I believe I learned enough about object- oriented programming and event-driven programming to apply that knowledge to other languages and future projects. I am not a professional programmer, although I do program in my profession (engineering). The class helped me to understand Python in particular, and modern programming in general. I plan to take the rest of the Signature Track courses in the Fundamentals of Computing track.

I am continuing on through the other sections of this course and eventually the capstone project. I am enrolled in the signature track. I HIGHLY recommend this course. The instructors are great and so is the content.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33845</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-28</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Nil , not much programming experience for me except a bit of high school programming they start from ground up and by end of 8 weeks you can end up creating very interesting stuff.

Some programming many many years ago. I have yet to try other programming courses. This one will be a very hard act to follow. Though I had sufficient time to invest to ensure a good outcome for myself I am aware that others have struggled to find enough free time to make the class effective. My initial intent was to only spend a few hours a week on the class and repeat it later to fill in the gaps. But it was such an enjoyable experience that I ended up putting in many more hours.

I highly recommend it to EVERYONE and if you do decide to take it I will be rather envious because I cannot go through that experience again. It wasn't my first MOOC but will be the most remembered. I was new to Python, but have studied other languages in uni. The course is very well balanced: It never felt easy and/or boring (unlike some others) and challenged me right at that fine line where the assessments were just hard enough to require plenty time thinking and not seem easy at first but not so challenging to cause frustration. The teachers seem to love what they do and it comes across in many ways that makes the course and watching the lectures that much more enjoyable. I am a full- time uni student as well and yet I ended up watching this course's lectures, doing the quizzes and mini-projects before everything else. I've even submitted my actual uni assignments (for which I paid) late because I got too busy doing the mini-projects in this course (which didn't cost me a dime) that weren't due until much later in the week. If you're reading this to help you decide and because there's the slight chance you may take this course, JUST DO IT!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33839</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This was an informative and entertaining class. The instructors are friendly, personable, and refused to take themselves too seriously in the videos. The lectures are well-done, covering a good range of topics in Python. The mini- projects are structured well so that they not only incorporate new material, but also build on material from past projects. I came away from this course feeling I had actually learned something.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33838</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Highly recommended course! It was quite challenging but provided tremendous resources to support even novices. My background is in Educational Technology, and I was very impressed with the design of the course. The weekly project assignments were perfectly designed to teach that week's concepts, from the start with "Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock" teaching the basic concepts of logic, conditionals, and functions to the capstone "Rice Rocks" dealing with classes, sprites, and sets. The short weekly lecture videos were entertaining as well as informative. Each week had one or two quizzes that reinforced the concepts and challenged your understanding. Short practice exercises (with solutions provided in case you really got stumped) did a great job of scaffolding the users progress. A major advantage provided by a popular MOOC is the forum. There is a lot of support available here, from other students, community TAs, and even the instructors. Beyond learning to write code in Python, this course is an exceptional way to learn how to learn. You get compelling challenges presented in a fun and engaging way, feedback through both peer assessments and forums, and lots of resources to help you succeed. This course offers the excellent benefits of learning to code: developing your ability to think logically, systematically, and creatively. It would be a shame if the only people who take Intro to Interactive Programming with Python are those specifically interested in writing code for games. Just about everyone could benefit greatly from taking this course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33836</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This class is perfect for both beginners and more experience programmers.

More focus should be spent on maths in the first three weeks, but from week four the professors incorporate formulas in the games and address all the necessary maths to complete the mini-projects successfully. Professors Warren and Rixner were the stars of the course, and their dynamic "rivalry" made watching the lessons seem more like a tv show than studying a course. Professor Greiner is a bit dry initially, but once you warm up to his teaching style it is endearing. His videos were easy to grasp. Sometimes the course was incredibly difficult, other times it was incredibly easy. It was hard to judge at a glance which mini-project would be difficult. I would have preferred a weeknight due date as it would have given me the weekend to do the course and I could have focused on my work and life during the week. But as soon as I had a day off the project was due the same day and I found all my Saturdays were spent in front of the computer for pretty much the full 8 weeks. Quite a few students mentioned not finishing their projects due to running out of time; that full-time workers don't have weekdays to do the course might have contributed to this. I would highly recommend this course because you do know enough Python to do whatever you wish with the language, of course more study is required, but overall as Professor Rixner states, you learn enough to be dangerous. Thanks professors for such a great course!

I am one of those newbies to programming that the course welcomed. The structure of the class - a new game project each week that incorporated the lecture info - was perfectly suited to the subject matter. The first week was a breeze and each new project built on the skills learned in the previous week. The professors - Scott and Joe - are very good at explaining concepts new to me. All the supplemental materials and the frequent (but not too frequent) communications were helpful and made me feel a part of a community. The video competition is a very nice addition for those who had the additional time... watching them was very helpful with the projects. Overall, I highly recommend this course - for folks new to programming as well as those who already know a programming language.

Taking this class gave me some hope, that programming classes can be fun, even when you are actually studying! But that does not mean you will pass this course easily - if you are a novice, then you really should try to keep you motivation high. As some students say, this course is quite fast-paced (it's true for me too). What I've found very helping - is the course forum! When in trouble with an assignment or understanding some certain topic, I've got answers or ideas how to tweak the code to make it work - on the discussion forum! The teachers use video-lectures very effectively (e.g., the week material is chopped into short videos on specific topic, which makes them easier to digest or re-watch if needed) and ... they are different persons with own style of teaching (and they even have battle tournaments!!)), which kind of helps staying interested and connected to the course. A rare occasion, when it's not like "Many commanders sink the ship", but when they all keep the thing working).

I did not engage so much in the practice exercises but used the TAs and the discussion forums to help me move along. While I wrote MEDIUM for course difficulty, as a beginner to Python I think it was on the harder side of MEDIUM. This is also why I put more than 12+ hours / week. The course suggests anywhere between 6-10 hr/wk but I did not have any prior knowledge so I found myself working late at night trying to problem solve the mini projects.

Hardly any ( I am aware of only one other ) beginner programming class concentrates on GUI basis for approaching programming. The class really shines out by capturing a delightful application of programming using Games that almost all of us have come across; and by empowering us to enable building those games. It provides immense joy and a great smug-ish satisfaction in showing off those games to our friends. The other most important salient feature has to be CodeSkulptor, built by an instructor of the class; which is a Python environment with a simple take on a GUI library, letting beginners build programs with relative ease.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33783</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The great class. I definitely can recommend it to everyone who are studying programming. If you want to learn all that basic stuff like if-else statements, for loops, classes etc, it's a good start there. The course is going from easy stuff to more complicated things. And the main point - you see the results (funny games) immediatelly in CodeSkulptor (google this), and its Viz mode is very helpful when you are trying to understand what's going on under the hood. The teachers have made a fabulous work. My studies could be more boring thing: you know, all those books where you understand hardly a half of content and easily forget it on the next month. Thank goodness that I took this course at the very beginning of my programming education.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33781</review_data_id><review_date>2014-09-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Great course for Python Great course for PythonGreat course for Python Great course for Python Great course for Python Great course for Python Great course for Python Great course for Python Great course for Python Great course for PythonGreat course for Python</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33780</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-27</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>It was a wonderful experience taking this course.

However, I have never written anything in Python. I was curious about Python as I have watched it gain in popularity. I decided to enroll in this course to get a feel for Python and how it works. I also desired to do some programming more geared towards fun (games) than my normal programming. This course was a great course. It was somewhat challenging to experienced programmers like me. It provided open ended projects that you could choose to enhance beyond the rubric. The quizzes check for synthesis of the materials. The projects were fun. The pace of the program was fine for an experienced programmer. There were a few weeks that were easier than others so the workload did vary week-to-week. The challenge I see in this course is the peer evaluations. There are a small minority who don't take those evaluations serious and just click through giving full credit even when it isn't deserved. At the same time, I think there are some who mark off even when there isn't any need to mark off. I'm not sure if this is because they are not able to read more advanced code or if they want your code to look like theirs regardless of whether it works or not. Thankfully, both of these are minor cases. Overall this is a GREAT course for beginners. Python is a relatively easy language to learn. The instructors to a good job of keeping the course fun. They also do a fantastic job of encouraging beginners and challenging experienced programmers. I would recommend this course to anyone wanting to learn about programming.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33764</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Good intro to Python programing.

It was the best run course from the many I have taken over several platforms. The subject is interesting and useful, and is presented in the best possible way. It's clear to tell from its polish, that the presentation of the material and course organization have been given a lot of thought. I had some experience with Python, but this course does not rely on it. The learning curve is extremely well thought-out. They also have also prepared custom tools that complement the course to give pain-free hands-on experience. The weekly assignment projects are not minimal tech demos, but games that (especially from week 4 onwards) are really fun to play. The staff dedication can be seen in how quickly they respond to forums and the dedicated teams of TAs that give you tailored advice on your code. I cannot speak highly enough of this course, and, having been a TA for another MOOC, can appreciate the amount of work that goes into making it such a success.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33761</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I had already started programming on my own, learning from books mostly.

The lecturers clearly enjoyed making the videos, but their involvement goes beyond that, also monitoring the discussion forums and engaging directly with the students' questions and comments. For someone with my level of knowledge, the course could probably have been completed in 3-4 hours per week, but I was having fun with the programming and wanted to spend longer tweaking and testing the programs I had written. I can't recommend the course highly enough for someone who is interested to learn python and create games.

The content was well organized and well-explained. Most of the professors were charismatic and their personalities made the lectures entertaining. I can honestly say I chuckled numerous times throughout my studies due to their efforts. The only negative I can think of is that sometimes concepts that are barely touched on are actually crucial for the implementation of a project later-on, leaving the student with a great deal of self-study and catching up to do. I had this problem with certain aspects of the draw function when making the Pong game. That being said, the forums and support staff are very helpful and if you are determined to figure things out, you will have all the resources necessary to do so. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in getting started with programming in Python, but I would also hasten recommend either a lot of determination or some minor self-study to prepare oneself for this course, as it moves at a brisk pace, especially if you are new not just to Python but to programming in general.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33752</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>While I have 16 years experience of programming in many other languages, I had no knowledge at all of Python.

I flunked out of university when I was younger, but wanted to try to learn now that I am older and I have different priorities. I had never programmed any Python before this class, but I feel pretty confident in my skills now. No, not enough to get a job, but enough to have a solid base. Also, I know what areas I need improvement in. The professors all have their own styles, but each is easy to understand. They really try to put some humor into the class and it helps. You can't say the profs don't care, as they really try hard with the video lectures and keeping an eye on the forums. The project game duels at the end of each week is great too. This was my first MOOC class and I think I was lucky to get a good one to start with. The class has been challenging for me many weeks. My wife is tired of me waiting till Saturday to do my weekly project and then hiding away working on it. One thing I value is knowing what my weak areas are due to the way the class was structured and taught. I am happy with the class and proud of what I have accomplished.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33737</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I am probably not the typical student for an intro to programming course, as I am an experienced engineer with a long career in product development. I am now in a senior leadership position, so I have no production coding responsibilities. I am taking the course to learn a new language that is being used in some of our new developments. Overall it is a great course, but I wanted to highlight three particular aspects: 1) The overall approach with humorous video lectures and the hook of creating games is very appealing for me, and I would think the same would be true for novice programmers. Much better than my intro back in the dark days of computing, where I learned FORTRAN using punch cards submitted as batch jobs to an IBM mainframe. 2) The development environment using CodeSkulptor is very simple and accessible, and the Viz debugging mode seals the deal. No complicated installation of platform development tools. 3) Earlier this week I finished the last mini-project. As an old procedural programmer with years of C scars, I have previously struggled with getting my arms around OO development. I found the examples and mini-project to be very approachable, and I feel like I finally understand it. A fun and interesting way to learn a language!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33733</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is an excellent course with fantastic teachers and superlative support material.

The instructors do a great job with course and tool design, breaking everything down into manageable pieces, and the forums are active and supportive. I'm married to a really great programmer -- he's really great, but he's really great at programming, too -- and in his opinion Python was a good choice for a first language to learn.

I'd been doing a bunch of non-mook online text based courses and I'd made a small amount of progress over a long time. This mook however provided me with the community and support to wrap my head around some of the concepts which previously had eluded me. I can honestly say this course has given me a solid foundation in Object Oriented Programming in Python. I don't think it's possible to understate the benefit of the community aspect of this course and the peer review structure...scoring other students work is probably what helped me the most because it gave me a broad cross section of different coding styles and ways of solving coding problems.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33716</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Loved this class! I honestly wish it didnt have to end. The projects were challenging but always fun. Every single week you are building a game as a project.

It has fun and engaging videos and not those boring videos where someone is just reading you a powerpoint. It has lots of examples, quizzes as well as mini-projects to get your hands dirty. Although this class is not a walk in the park, I think it is doable for everyone interested in learning Python or programming in general. If you're still in doubt, don't! Just sign up: it's free and if you want a verified certificate it will cost you only about 50 dollars.

Had this been my first programming class I would have majored in computer science! The professors are all very knowledgeable, dynamic and have created a set of fun, fast-paced videos that teach a surprising amount of coding techniques in just eight weeks. The staff must spend a tremendous amount of time responding to the dozens of forum questions posted every day..and the games are great! P.S. count on 12+ hours a week, if you are new to programming. With some experience, the lessons took 5-7 hours for the first 4 weeks. The last projects took considerably longer.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33711</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is the best course on Python I ever came across. The difficulty level increases as the course progress, but thats how we are going to improve logical thinking and fine tune our brain.

And, the instructors were FUN and I looked forward to the new lectures and quizzes and projects each week. The instructors enjoy teaching the class and working with each other. Excellent way for experienced systems programmers (non-OOP, all C/Assembly/etc.) to pick up on Object Oriented Concepts in a FUN way. Also, if you're a traditional systems developer, the projects are interactive and are also a fun new way of programming. Excellent for total new-comers as well - it just may take a little more time during each week. Can't say enough good things...it was just what I needed. I'd recommend it to old colleagues and my nephew entering high-school. "How does this course compare to others?" It was FUN!

Only had minimal Python experience, but have learned other languages before. They had a good approach and were able to convey the information easily for the weekly assignments. Those of which were very well laid out and broken down in easier to bite steps with a clear grading rubric to aim for.

Unusual in that it teaches the language around gaming, building up from simple text games to more complex graphic games. Coding can be entered and run via the web browser (codeskulptor), running on the providers servers For projects, boiler plate code (templates) is provided to get you started on a project with suggested routes and way points to final solutions. Any maths required for a given project are explained and formulas given. Delivery is relaxed, not a PowerPoint presentation in sight, with lecturers on screen at all times explaining concepts and ideas so no disembodied audio tracks! Another unusual aspect to the course are peer reviews and marking of submitted projects by fellow students. Useful in giving visibility of other students solutions and quite often more "efficient" solutions than your own. Also videos provided on programming errors and possible solutions. Fully supported by student forums and code clinics. Highly recommended for beginners to more competent programmers with an interest in an introduction to interactive programming</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33685</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-26</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>I wasn't familiar at all with the programming (some Logo and Pascal in elementary school, which was 15 yrs ago) and I found this course to be both fun, useful and rewarding.

A class that tells you that you will be making a fully functional game 8 weeks later is very tempting. The class is well-structured and the teachers are great, especially Joe and Scott's 'game rivalry'. The assignments are progressively harder but doable. Another good aspect of this class is that they make you grade your peers assignments, and that gives you the opportunity of seeing others people perspective towards the same problem and probably find out a good thing or two to implement in your future assignments.

All in all very well thought out and presented by the instructors with assistance from the TAs in the forum. I recommend the class for anyone looking to experience interactive programming for the first time.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33667</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I come from a background in Perl programming, so in theory, this course should have been less fun. However, I found this course extremely enjoyable and have learned many new concepts. I especially liked the object oriented which was new to me ( as Joe Warren said - "like driving on the left hand side " , takes some adjustments , but afterwards you get the hang of it!) I enjoyed the mini- projects , even the basic ones , not to mention the advanced projects which were awesome ! I must add that , Joe Warren and Scott Rixner , are one of the best teaching crews I encountered ! This is how teaching should look like! You can see the passion for programming and their efforts to pass a clear message . One word - incredible ! They deserve it ! I just hope that there are other courses that they teach !</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33666</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>As a non professional programmer, I use Python to easy my work for data collection and process. This class is at the Top level of so many training classes I had. This course use a direct way to tell you how to write simple and clean programs. The best I learn from this course is that I can use Class based method to program. I read many books about Class programming, non of them just show me how Class really rocks when we are programing. This course gives me the idea through quiz and mini projects which are great examples. Thanks very much for this wonderful courses!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33665</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I was a complete beginner in programming, and was really scared when I started taking this class. I was worried it was going to be boring and un-engaging like most "course" I had to take up at work. However I have made it through the class, made 7 games and best thing is I managed to get all of them to work! It was a real joy and sense of accomplishment! I think all the teachers behind this course really put together a very well thought out course, delicately balanced, between just-in-time scaffolding and challenges appropriate for the learner. Scott and Joe's sense of humor, and how they bothered to plant easter eggs in their lecture, really makes taking its video lecture fun! The support provided for this class is also very sufficient, with a forum, code clinic, support email and the TA who work very hard to try and help out in the forum. The classmates in this community are also supportive with their positive comments, sharings on the forum and helping each others out.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33664</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Great course, had close to 0 experience in python prior to starting this course.

The main feature of this course is the very well-signposted programming exercises. Instead of them asking you to "Program Pong" and leaving you to get stuck, they provide a checklist of important steps and tests. This means you spend more time coding, and less being stuck. Great course, amusing lecturers.

I found the most enjoyable things about this class are the mini-projects where you're supposed to build games. The satisfaction you get from completing a project is very rewarding. I also have to give props to the professors teaching the class, esp Joe and Scott. They did excellent job explaining things. Also, the discussion forum is a great place to be when you're stuck and need answers. The people are very helpful, and some of them are programmers so they know more than other students. Overall, I recommend this course to everyone who likes challenge, problem-solving, or just interested to learn how to program.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33656</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Very good course.

Lectures are easy enough to follow for a starter but not too much as for a more experienced programmer to find them annoying.

This class did an incredible job in teaching us the fundamentals in a very fun way. We made incredible games, albeit with the help of professors. But I think the most I got out of this class was learning to stick with it. There were so many times where I wanted to throw in the towel. With the help of the lectures and the forum I was able to complete this class. If you are those that think learning the basics (what is a variable, string, function, loop, conditional, etc) is such a drag, I recommend this class. The professors do a great job in blending basics with the projects at hand. For example, we didn't learn about loops or lists right away, we learned them at a later stage when the programs we had to write called for them.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33647</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Really nice class to take if you are new to programming in general or just new to the Python language.

Although you may think that this course is for those wanting to write games in python, it's really so much more. A great introduction to programming in general, and to python specifically, the course covers the basics of programming in a fun and intuitive style. I'd had a little self taught experience in programming but it was great to have more formal training, including an introduction to OOP. If you're deciding to take it or not, just take a look at these reviews and you shouldn't doubt any longer. What are you waiting for? Become dangerous!

The course revolves around the completion of a mini-project each week (8 in total) and each week you were provided with a template to work from and very clear description of what needed to be done to complete the program - this approach took away a lot of the "where do I even get started" issues which I have found when programming in the past. The videos explain the coding constructs needed to build each program and build up from a very simple console based game to a fully animated asteroids clone. The forums for this course were also excellent - you could email your code to a code clinic if you got really stuck and the instructors &amp; TAs were very involved on the forums (which is particularly impressive given that the session I took was the 4th time they'd run the course) I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in programming, whatever your experience (or lack thereof). I had not programmed for almost 10 years, and never in python, and I found this a great way back into the subject.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33638</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This class offers so much that it even exceeds my own college introduction to programming class. I had some experience in programming but that was really too little and I would only imagine to build these kind of games which I built in this class. Professors were very kind, wise and really good at introducting the ideas and implementing them to my mind. One of the greatest achievement of the class, I think, it gives you enough knowledge and experience that you can exceed what you were taught and do a lot of things that can be done with a programming language. I have enough confidence to build a game if I really want to. I'd like to thank Joe, Scott and all the people that behind the scenes.

All the game development takes place on CodeSkulptor built by Scott Rixner, which I must say is a magnificent piece of work. The course material is well laid out, and promises you to teach you to build a game almost from scratch, even if you are a beginner to programming or Python. I have had experience with Python, however, I never could get into OOP. This course does a wonderful job at helping me figure out OOP (although it can be reasonably difficult for a fresher in this topic), specially since OOP is the crux of games. The mini-projects are fun. The guidelines for peer- grading are such that you can innovate as much as you want as long as your work satisfies the rubric specified. Recommended for everyone. Go on! Start creating your own game !</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33610</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>A really good class for learning programming and the basic of Python.

I always wanted to learn Python though so took the opportunity to learn it on this course. In summary it's superb, a great learning opportunity and a ton of fun to participate in. The main reasons in my opinion are: 1) The instructors are hugely likeable, engaging, witty and committed to the extent that they spend hours helping out on the class forums 2) It's very hands on, the weekly quizzes are challenging and require you to really understand the material being studied and the weekly programming assignments reinforce this. 3) The Code Skulptor environment is ideal for learning, easy to setup and understand and allows you to quickly get to work rather than waste time on tools. 4) The weekly programming assignments form the bulk of the work and see you develop increasingly sophisticated games such as Pong, Memory, Blackjack and culminating in Asteroids. These are all fun projects and just enough template code is given so that you never feel out of depth or lost and if you do the forums are a great place to seek help. I believe this team is going on to do some more Coursera CS courses so I hope to find time to take those as I'm sure they'll be of a similar quality.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33590</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The best course I've never enroll !

Both the auto-graded quizzes and the peer-reviewed projects are at their best when the subject being taught is practical and complex. This is a very polished introductory course, all in all enjoyable. The only critics I have are the use of a custom made library and programming environment, which make it harder to take the lessons learned "out into the world". Aside from that, the course is fun and challenging without ever being frustrating.

The course was so much fun and very efficient and useful, I am ever so grateful to the developers. This is also the first course I have ever completed, usually I quit for whatever reason. Total beginners might have to work hard, but it is still manageable - the teaching team is simply awesome! I will continue studying with the next course "Principles of computing". The course structure, the contents, the instructors and the way they present the material are truly excellent. I can recommend it to people with little-to-no experience in programming, and not only to those who are interested in games, the whole package I have learned can be applied anywhere in the interactive programming.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33579</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I had no experience with Python and this class taught me a lot.

Creating a game, and that satisfaction you get once you create a game is what makes this course worth it. I have experience in other programming languages. Comparing to others languages, python is very straight forward. So i found it easy to accept whatever the teachers taught. However i'm sure first timers will face some difficulty, but trust me its worth it. And as for the difficulty, the discussion forums help every one to manage through out the course. Listen to them, listen to the given instructions for the mini-project, and you'll get through. The teachers are very very friendly, very supportive, in fact i'm so hooked on with their courses that i have already enrolled their up coming class 'Principles of Computing'. These are great teachers. I have to be honest, this is the first class that i have completed. I usually join classes, and quit in the middle either because i dont think its worth my time or its not my domain of interest, or simply because its boring. However this class is just interesting. And definately worth taking.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33576</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-26</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>I have been programming but Python was new to me.

The teaching style and videos were enjoyable. The content was well-explained and had more than enough material to be able to complete the assessments. Everything was easy to follow and understandable. The mini-projects were fun and gave a sense of accomplishment in what was produced, especially the final project which was to create a game of Asteroids. I've programmed in other languages before so I didn't find the course very hard, but I think it might be a challenge for people who are totally new to programming especially since it goes into object-oriented stuff. Some of the projects had a bit of math knowledge in them (trig and motion stuff) which some people might find daunting if they do not have the background. You'd be ok if you were solid with high school level stuff. The course is fairly time intensive, you will need to have a few hours spare each week to spend on the assessment items and the deadlines are weekly so falling behind isn't a good option. I haven't taken any other courses but I can't imagine that many are better than this one. There wasn't anything I disliked about the course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33572</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Fantastic!!!

So I knew what I was getting into, I took the course specifically to learn gui programming in python. While the course focuses on writings simple games in python with fairly scaled down versions of both python and a gui library written specifically for this course, it will help you write programs well beyond simple games. I thoroughly enjoyed the course. Learned alot about gui programming in python and python in general. I would reccomend this course to anyone who already had a little knowledge about programming or scripting, as it is fairly fast paced. I can see how someone who never wrote one line of code, could lag behind towards the end of this course. That being said, if you have plenty of time to devote to this class then you can go from absolutely no experience at all to passing this course. Its a great course. I'm taking the next one in the series, called "Principles of Computing" coming in a few weeks. The support structure and info is all top notch.

Besides this I also took the MOOC of Computer Networks from Coursera and Washington University, compared to that one this class has a better structure and is less complicated. This course was a huge help in order to properly understand the basics of GUI programming and OOP. The class has been planned really carefully and it's designed to make students learn, theres' support via emails and on the forums, besides the lectures are always clear and helpful. I would like to thank Coursera and Rice University, the teachers and assistance for putting this together, it was really helpful to me and will help me with my professional career from now on. I'm 32 years old, non native speaker... so If I could make it, any one can do it, it's just a matter of determination.

I also took a course from Udacity. In terms of this course, the videos are well made. Teachers are great at teaching programming. They were more available than the CS teachers at my university, and their TA's were very kind. It was very, very helpful to watch teachers actually writing codes and debugging codes for real. The development steps were also very helpful. Without them, I couldn't even have begun any of the assignment games. The example codes and exercises were also very helpful in doing assignments. The two things that I'm not satisfied about is that it did teach us about the web application. The games we created lives only within CodeSkulptor. Also, it doesn't have part 2. I want this class to keep going and show us more advanced game codings. My big thanks to all teachers, TAs, and everyone in the forum.

I like the course because I was able to do things a slower pace, specifically being able to take my time with quizzes and projects. I had a dislike which eventually became a like and that was the video lecture / quiz / assignment requirements and the structure needed to stay on task. As a historically disorganized person, I learned how to become a more organized, focused person following this course structure.

I have dabbled with JavaScript making rollovers in HTML, but otherwise have never coded before. I was doing the Java programming course at the Khan academy at the same time as doing IIPP and I dropped Khan (though it was easier) as I was getting confused between the two different languages, and I was enjoying Python course much more, as I was making fun games as well as learning. I thoroughly enjoyed coding each of the Mini Projects, then got the joy of playing the games after I had finished building them. If I had a challenge with part of the code, I would just need to go to the forums and I would usually find that someone else was struggling with the same section of code as I was and that there were many others offering helpful hints on how to work out what was needed. I also found that the practical exercises (with solutions) were a great help as each weeks exercises were examples similar to what was needed for the Mini Project, and I could look at the exercise solution code, make some adjustments (IE it wasn't just a straight copy and paste) for what was needed in the mini project. The practical exercises were also great for improving my coding style. Early in the course I would often do an exercise and achieve the required outcome, then look at the solution and see 3 lines of code where I had needed 5 or 6. Later in the course I could mostly get the solution with similar amounts of code. Overall I would Highly recommend IIPP for anyone who is interested in a great introduction to a programming language, with little or no prior experience.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33536</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Fantastic course.

I would recommend this as a starting point before someone jumps further into other more advance languages like Java and C# or C++. The projects and practice exercises are structured in such a way that re-enforcing the lectured materials and hard- wire the programming concepts in brain. Rice University also offers more advance CS courses as part of the same series. I have glanced through the material and these appears to carry over the same high quality.I would definitely recommend those if someone is looking to pursue further heavy courses in math and programming (like some courses offered online by MIT and Stanford University) At the very last, if I have to choose the best aspect of this course (among many excellent aspects), this will be the way the mini projects were broken down. All of the mini projects were true and vivid examples of how to move from the "large &amp; complex" to something that we can observe and comprehend the "internal circuitry". How to first code the simple operation and then "care" about the more complex functions. How to compose a "skeleton" programming structure and then flesh it up. And although many different implementations can equally work, after following and completing the structure based on the recommendations, it becomes all apparent why it was more efficient to group the code together (as per suggestions). In particular, the OPP-driven projects were excellent in demonstrating how to group the code in such way so additional requests for functionality can easy be accommodated without the need to discard code and start from scratch again.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33532</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I had no prior experience in computer programming and I found this course difficult.

I have no prior programming experience, and had heard of Python as a higher level programming language. I took it because I love computers and technology in general, but do not have any understanding on what goes on behind the scenes. I figured I had to start somewhere and this was my first step towards understanding that... The instructors of this course are great! The lectures are nicely paced, aimed at beginners but when you listen to them carefully, there's a lot one can learn reading between the lines and looking up recommended reading, which is also free and available in the course. As far as the grading goes, there are usually two multiple choice question format quizzes (not timed) that students need to submit. These are very clearly and cleverly formulated, which make the student go back to their notes, to documentation, and make sure that s/he has really understood the topic about which the question is asked. The quizzes are computer graded and one can attempt each quiz upto 5 times without a penalty. (best of all attempts is considered as effective score). There is also an a programming assignment each week - these are the most exciting and practically useful, but also difficult part of the class. However, there's plenty of help to start with - a recommended programming template, forums, documentation guidance and above all - email support from the course TA's which very few or no MOOC classes offer. The assignments are peer graded and self-graded, and the grading rubric is VERY clear, making it extremely effective and unambiguous to grade peers. All in all, it was a great class for me, and I plan to continue to build my knowledge of programming and Computer Science as a hobby. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this class to any beginner who wishes to understand programming, including basics of object-oriented programming. Best luck!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33514</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Great intro to programming and Python.

The computer games projects that are the focus for this course are a terrific vehicle for digging into these topics. The quizzes of which there were one or two per week, prepared the student for the weekly project. It was a lot of fun to learn in the system that Coursera and the Rice University professors have created. I have done extensive Matlab and Fortran scientific programming in the past. This course provided a painless, fun resource for gaining experience with Python and with basic object oriented programming.

The framework combining short lectures, quizzes, mini projects with frequent peer and self reviews firmly drives home the new information. The interactive forums are both inspiring and entertaining. They are also very helpful to anyone struggling to complete an assignment and must drastically reduce the dropout rate. The CodeSkulptor tool makes this course unique. The ability to develop, run and debug your code directly in your web browser, without installing any Python development kit, is a huge bonus. This also makes reviewing your peer's code a doddle. This also means you can share your completed projects with anyone that has access to the web! The final, and probably most important, key to the effectiveness of this training method is the presentation of material. The lectures are short, the presenters really know the material and are engaging and personable. The humorous banter between them makes one look forward to the next video. (Warning: this course can be as addictive as your favorite soap opera or situation comedy!). Seriously though, the professors and lecturers are those you wish you'd had at your university. I highly recommend this course to anyone wishing to learn Python or programming in general. Unless you are already a Python guru, you will learn a lot in a very short time and have great fun in the process. So, if you are hesitating, wondering if this course is for you.... enrole immediately. You'll be glad you did.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33508</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Fun course and learned a lot.

Eight weeks duration is just the right length and keeps you going even when you have little time. The main benefit is that you can start directly without first downloading and installing software. No need to learn complicated menus and software only to write your first “Hello World” program. For example getting started with Visual Studio, installing it, learning how to navigate around is a big effort. Using Simple-GUI and getting all software tools you need to do the course is a big relive.

The pace is perfect, there wasn't a time when I was stuck, and on the other hand, I felt I was really working on problems, not just breezing through. Perhaps I was the right audience for the course - I haven't had any serious experience with programming previously (I tried to code in Basic some twenty years ago, and I took a short Codecademy Python introductory track a couple of weeks before this Coursera course - and that was more than enough). So thanks to Coursera, thanks to Rice University, thanks to Joe, Scott and John. By the way, Rice has two more Python courses on Coursera that are more advanced. I haven't took them yet but after this class I'm definitely going to.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33499</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-25</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Hadn't had any Python experience before taking this class but had some programming experience in scientific languages like Matlab and labview.

I took a couple of courses on other websites and I pretty much new the basics. But it was never enough! I had yet to find a course that would actually teach me how to apply the things that I learn to real world applications until IIPP came along. On-line courses usually have projects in the form of basic exercises and problems which is good, it helps you test what you've learned but after a point it becomes boring. This course was based around what is called event driven programming and around building games which as you can imagine, was awesome. We built actual 2D games and we didn't even have to download anything or anything like that thanks to this feature called Codeskulptor. It's available for everyone on codeskulptor.org and it's an amazing editor built by one of the professors teaching the class, Scott Rixner. All of the teachers are amazing, they are very friendly and they actually care about the students very much. They are monitoring the forums so they can help as many people as possible in the best of ways. The community's TA's also put their hand in that as well of course providing help to anyone who requires it. Lastly, I want to emphasise on how this course does things differently from any other course I have ever seen. If you would like to join I can assure you that even if you are a complete beginner or an expert you are going to learn a lot and above all, you are going to have much much fun while doing it.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33491</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>From having NO IDEA of python programing and almost no programing background (just a few powershell and bash scripting knowledge), after only these 8 weeks, I feel completely confident in python and very happy and pleased with course materials and the way teachers teach this class.

As an experienced C/C++ programmer, I have learned a lot from this course and have better understanding about Python programming language. I would like to recommend this course to my friends if they want to learn entry- level Python programming. An I do expect to see a more advanced Python course in the future, such as teaching data structures and algorithms, or applications in the real-world situations.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33487</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I started programming back in the 70's when it was done on a VAX - what I remember most was that groups of us would code together. We would spent nights writing code and then executing it.That was what made it so fun. This class captures that spirit. Its an excellent environment for introducing students to some very difficult concepts that 95% of programming classes will never achieve. You will not get another class as good as this with all the extracurricular support provided by staff and students. I learned a lot about programming style from watching and learning how other students tackled these problems. Don't forget to utilize the concepts page with sample projects and the student videos were excellent. There was so much to view that I never had time to take another class.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33486</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I've programmed for 25 years, on a do-what's-needed basis.

Only some C programs to compute air navigation data and SQL. I have to say, after completing this amazing course, that I feel good, proud and happy. The professors are brilliant, fun, enthusiatic, smart and charismatic. The lessons are extermely accurate, the quizzes are a good example to test your level and the development of the mini projects have been really interesting. The discusions at forums and the help of some other students have been massive and great. A very good experience if you want to know the basic of a new language programming, from the global varibles and the structured code to the OOP with classes, methods and so on, with and excelent web shell, codeskulptor, made by one of the teachers. Really, really recommended course. A big thank you to Rice University and these excelent professors. It was fun and brilliant course.

I always wanted to learn programming and I think i am good at it, but couldn't have the opportunity before to get a good class and start this journey, but with this program, An Introduction of Interactive Programming in Python, was a blast. I highly encourage people to take this course and stay to the end of this, you will find it rewarding and fun. If you ask me to rate this class, i would give it 7 shiny stars but I am only allowed to choose 5 !!! Special thanks to Joe Warren and Scott Rixner, the two wonderful professors who taught the class, for their dedication and teaching style.

Whatever is your previous skill (even if is '0') you will love this course. Teachers are just great and fun but, the best, is how they paced the miniprojects every week. On these mini project you'll develop funny games (including a shoot'em up spaceship one) to learn step by step the fundamentals of Python power. And yes, at the end, as one of the teacher says you will be really dangerous (or in the way to be). You only need to be aware that the deadline for the miniproject is quite tight (in my case, central Europe time) 7AM sunday that practically means finishing it by the end of saturday. So watch the quite short video trainings at the beginning of the week, do the quizzes afterwards and start the miniproject by thursday afternoon if possible. That gives you time to face programming issues you may find.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33475</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>In this course you'll not only learn to program in Python but also how to program various games.

I was a little hesitant in taking an introductory course that didn't use a 'real' IDE, but CodeSkulptor is full featured enough that the concepts they teach you in the class are applicable once you move on to something else (I personally use Eclipse with PyDev now). Scott and Joe are great instructors and they do a very good job at presenting material at a brisk pace while still offering concise explanations and demonstrations of that material. I did have some self taught experience with Python, and that helped mitigate the learning curve a bit. Someone starting completely fresh (no programming experience) will probably have to work a little extra hard to keep up for the first several weeks. Overall though, this was a fantastic introduction to programming. You write games that you can share with your family and friends, and it is a tremendous feeling to have them play your games and enjoy them. It really pushes you to want to improve on the basic versions you write in the class.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>33470</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The only other cs class I took CS 101 it's self paced and very quick and it is helpful for someone with no cs background.

I haven't taken many MOOCs but this class is a lot more thorough than the others I have taken. I liked that the mini projects were games, they really kept me motivated to finish them.

There are abundant online resources to help learn the language. Many of which do a better job and with a lot less overhead than the coursera course. Its key distinction is that it purports to teach "interactive" programming. It attempts this with a proprietary (not open source like the rest of python) library/environment called Codeskulptor. This is just another javascript library, which runs in the browser. I would like to be able to be more positive about the course, but it suffers from critical flaws: It's patronizing and dumbed down from the lame jokes, weekly tee shirts, and abbreviated discussions to the skimpy documentation. If the instructors took the trouble to describe their programming platform more fully, one could skip the video lectures, which are short on substance. Whatever skills and strengths the course staff have. Teaching, or indeed public speaking are not among them. The course was not overly difficult, but not worth the time vs. many other online, e.g. Edx, and offline, e.g., How to Think LIke a Computer Scientist. Their fixation on homegrown Codeskulptor environment is unfortunate, because superior solutions with active communities are readily available, e.g., Processing. It is indeed telling that there is no open source community and no apparent interest in Codeskulptor. Even for free there are better alternatives.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>28535</review_data_id><review_date>2014-04-10</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I am currently taking this class, and started a week late.

Anyway, the course is okay but it focuses on the wrong thing. It teaches you the python basics pretty well (variables, control structures, functions, etc) but fails to teach object-oriented programming. Instead of showing how to write OOP programs the course gives you already prebuilt scripts and all you have to do is to fill in some math. The part I disliked the most, though, is the framework they built for writing Python code (http://www.codeskulptor.org/); you have to use it instead of "normal" Python IDE or libraries (they have their own GUI lib). The peer review scoring is not related to code quality at all, so almost every time I reviewed a peer's code I awarded it with a perfect score despite the fact the code was far from perfect. Anyway, it's a pretty rewarding course as you're creating a game.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>4624</review_data_id><review_date>2013-12-21</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This was my first experience to opt python under some professional like sir joe warren and scott rixner.

It covers the basic data types such as variable, lists, sets and dictionaries. It also covers the basics of classes. A lot of the time is spent dealing with their own CodeSkulptor system. This is a useful system to allow python code to be run in a browser but it is highly non- standard. A lot of the applications developed are concerned with writing games. Presentation: The course is very well presented and the lectures have an infectious enthusiasm for the subject. Resources: The resources for the class include set practice exercises complete with starter code and complete sample solutions. There is also a “code clinic” where the staff provide more direct help to the students. Coursework: The coursework is based around developing a series of progressively more complex games. A lot of the lecture content is devoted to helping the student with these. The coursework itself is peer assessed. Summary: Overall it is a very well produced course but it is a little to simple and spend too much time covering the implementation of games on the proprietary system.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>4558</review_data_id><review_date>2013-12-15</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I took this course as a way to learn more about programming in python and I came away a more confident programmer and with a better understanding of the language.

I considered learning Python using CodeAcademy but I decided to take this longer learning route. A decision I am very happy I took. Not only did I gain a sound foundation in Python. Not only did I learn interactive techniques that I was able to apply to Georgia Tech's SDN class. I also learnt how to teach programming. I am now teaching my 10 year old daughter how to write basic Python functions using the techniques I learnt here. In short, a brilliantly executed and presented class from skilled lecturers who love teaching computer science.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2821</review_data_id><review_date>2013-07-22</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Very well structured, instructors were very motivated &amp; responsible. It was nice to see a team faculty effort as well. Each week's assignment was creating a game--the plus of this is that it was always interesting &amp; motivating, the minus is that we had to focus a fair amount on game related code (collisions, detecting when objects went off the screen, etc.), which, if you are ultimately not interested in writing games, can seem a wee bit much. But besides this minor point, the class was excellent. One super aspect of this was that the profs created a simple, elegant online programming environment that ran in your browser and did not require any code to run on your desktop-- which resulted in one-click code execution, not having to bother with compilers, libraries, etc. Highly recommended!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2804</review_data_id><review_date>2013-07-21</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Programming is not a natural aptitude of mine, but this course gave me confidence to try and keep trying.

The level of interaction and assistance was at least as good--or even better--than what I've experienced in regular online university courses. I have taken only one other online programming course (also free and non-credit); of the two, this one was the most enjoyable and supportive.

I am aware of what it takes to put together good training material and Joe Warren, Scott Rixner, John Greiner, and Stephen Wong do an excellent job of executing this class. I admire the fact that they continue to evolve the course, given the feedback they receive. They have done a great job of balancing instructional material, technical data, documentation, and humor to keep the class flowing at an appropriate pace. I started the class with no formal programming experience though I have been involved in software development by producing 2D and 3D graphics for quite some time. My career experience gave me a strong conceptual understanding of the software development issues but this course gave me the fundamental understanding that I had desired. This was my 3rd MOOC that I have taken and this has by far been the best. It did take a significant commitment of time to complete the course and I feel that my time was well spent being involved in this course!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2651</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-28</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I have experience in IBM large batch system programming, it was a little help..

This is the first course I've ever taken on programming and it's gotten me totally hooked. The instructors were fun and personable and they delivered their lectures with great content that was also engrossing in the way they taught it, and with just enough humor mixed in. Codeskulptor, the in-browser application for executing python code was well done and got the student used to using documentation to resolve problems and was a great tool for the course. The fact that the professors also created this tool is simply incredible, far beyond the call of duty. The quizzes and projects were both very informative in their own right--I didn't feel like they were a test of my knowledge so much as another learning tool, in which the real learning took place and I applied what I'd merely heard about in the lectures. To me this is taking maximum advantage of the MOOC format.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2635</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-25</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>It was my very first contact with python.

I took the course on a whim with absolutely ZERO prior programming experience, and though there were certain parts that proved challenging, I was able to complete all the assignments with full points to earn a pass "with distinction". What I liked about the course is that most of the lecture videos are relatively short (usually under 15 minutes), and the professors Warren and Scott try to keep things entertaining, so it's not too difficult to slog throug, though the "Programming Tips" videos with John were a bit on the dry side. What's fun is that the assignments have you build simple games, so there's a sense of accomplishment, and you get to try out other people's versions of the games through peer assessment. Some people really went all-out with their versions! There were a few concepts that I didn't think were sufficiently explained in the videos (like how to use the modulo function), but they do provide you with optional homework problems that are a big help if you're kind of lost. And the discussion forums seem to be a big help for some people (though I never personally needed to use it). Overall, it was a very positive experience for me, and I felt I learned a lot about the concepts of how to program in Python.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2596</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-23</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is an awesome course!

But I looked forward to working on the projects, esp late at night. The instructors are fabulous, and really enjoy teaching this class. Excellent content, and delivery of materials.

It was GREAT! Thanks to both Joe &amp; Scott and the time they invested building it. They did an excellent job that really paid off. I totally agree with other reviewers when they say that professors seem to like teaching. In my opinion it also made the whole learning process straightforward and fun. Most of all. I also had the oportunity of starting from scratch and build simple and fun games that I enjoyed testing while playing with my 6 year old kid. There is no price for that...

I write a lot of shell scripts and the occasional bit of Perl code but seldom write programs anymore (used to be fluent in COBOL, C, C++, and Java). I wanted to learn Python so I might be able to use it in my work. This was a somewhat hard course for me because of some of the math involved. More because I'm so removed from it now in my career. This was stuff I knew but it was years ago. Trying to reason some of the math needed in my head (and drawing pictures on paper) is why I spent more time than advertised on the class. I really liked this class and the instructors. I learned a lot and will now be able to transition that knowledge back to the work place. It was nice to spend time actually programming again and the projects, although challenging, were a lot of fun and the results were great. They also gave me a chance to be a bit creative in how to accomplish the goal. If these guys ever teach an advanced class I will be there with bells on. Great class and highly recommended. I also want to break out some of my neck ties in honor of Scott.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2482</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>As a person with only a very basic knowledge of computer programming and no prior experience with python itself, I found this class to be incredibly informative and rewarding.

The class is well organized and each week's lecture topics provided the necessary information to be able to complete the assignments. I liked that the instructors took the time to develop Code Skulptor for the class because it removed the environmental issues we might have encountered installing Python or using Python in whatever IDE we have on our personal computers. The instructors were also very clear about which browsers were supported by Code Skulptor.

If you have a job, and family, well, that just takes time away from them, and may not be good. On the other hand, if you can balance life activities, and squeeze in some time to take this course, you will not be dissatisfied.

If you are coming in completely fresh to both, figure on more time to accomplish the work. The course is taught in a fun manner and it was easy for me to stay attentive to the video lectures.

Let me tell you, you will not believe how much python you can learn in 8 weeks developing games, and how proud you can be when your friends spend a while playing with them. If you want to dive into programming this course is a must.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2454</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I enjoyed taking this class and it was very beneficial for my career as a computer scientist. I really liked working on the project and I think that the instructors did a great job with giving the exact steps in order to accomplish each project. I also appreciate a lot the discussion forms and whenever I got stuck I always could search the answer there. One thing that I would like to see an improvement is if possible to get an e-mail reminder about quizzes due date. I was so in to the mini projects every week that I forgot to do the quizzes in the first 4 weeks. So I hope I can still get credit for the class.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2453</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>AMAZING!

This is a good course for those who want to learn or re-learn Python and event driven programming no matter your experience level. The approach of ultimately creating a game makes this course even more enjoyable. The instructors are excellent presenters. The videos are well put together. The feedback and assistance you receive from the discussion forums are better than I expected. This is the first time I’ve taken a course delivered like this. The only negative for this course is the delivery of the videos. At times the video server must be overwhelmed because the browser would just pause for a long time waiting for the video. Closing the video and reloading it usually worked. At times I would have to download the video and watch it off line which was fine but a little annoying. Despite this minor annoyance, as I said before high marks to this course and its instructors.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2448</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I took 1.5 courses in python at Udacity, and found them rather frustrating.

While the material is not always easy, and a lot of topics and functions have been covered relatively fast, the exercises and mini-projects are built in a way that even relative beginners like me can follow with some effort and frustration (which I'm sure anyone with programming experience can attest to is par for the course), given the amount of time to go over them. Although I would have liked the course to be longer/moved a little slower, or maybe even take this course a second time in order to solidify what I learned, the course designers did an excellent job at introducing a good deal of python programming practices, functions, and design tips. The video lectures are rarely too long or dry, and the fun mini-projects (which are essentially simple versions of games like Pong, Blackjack, Asteroids, etc.) give us incentive to make things work so we can actually play the results of our efforts. Bravo to the course designers!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2442</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-17</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>This was a really great introduction to Python!

I've taken a half dozen MOOCs so far and this class is one of the best --- kuduos to Rice &amp; to these instructors for putting in the time, utilizing the technology appropriately, and recognizing that teaching to 40,000+ students online requires MUCH more than just video-taping lectures and posting them on the web.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2441</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Best programming class I've taken!

Joe and Scott are humorous and down to earth and at the same time 'got' their message across and showed their skill and expertise. I learned much about interactive programming in python and about making animated sprite sequences. For me I cannot image taking this class without some previous python coding experience.

It was my first GUI programming course, not only in Python, but in any programming language. My previous experience in C, Pascal, and Fortran had nothing to do with GUI programming but they did help in understanding constructs such as 'if' statements, loops, and functions. Some of the best topics I learned in this class, however, include frames, timers, draw functions, sound, images, lists, dictionaries, and object-oriented programming (OOP). I gained a firm understanding of these topics through this course. I learned how powerful these tools are and what I can do with them with regards to GUI programming. Of the three MOOC classes I've taken so far, this course is without a doubt the best and the most fun. I really enjoyed making games and the CodeSkulptor application, the video lectures, and course exercises really localized the material necessary to do so. I didn't have to go searching the Internet for supportive material on topics I didn't understand. I look forward to applying everything I've learned to making more games either in CodeSkulptor or some other Python GUI application such as TkInter.....</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2424</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course is very unique in terms of materials, teaching methods and teachers themselves.

The weekly projects start off easily enough, but there's a high difficulty spike around the mid-point, which can leave anyone but the most hardened beginning programmers wondering if learning this new trade is worth all of the anguish. Fortunately there is a highly active programming community in the discussion forums, and most folks are very insightful. I heavily relied on their abilities to make it through this class successfully. It's also important to note the professors are very active in this community, and more than willing to help a novice programmer who has lost his/her way. Take this course if you're in the process of learning Python and have any interest in videogames. It's wonderful.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2404</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-17</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Being an on again off again programmer and this my first exposure to python I found the course well structured and paced. I do however, think a basic understanding of programming should be pre-requisite for the course. The course is well supported with video lectures, forum support, and code examples, among other sources. Do be ready to invest some time working on your programs, should the material / topic being covered seem fuzzy to you. All in all this was a joy to partake in gave me a good basis for understanding graphic and OOP within the python environment.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2403</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The class material is very well organized and presented.

I knew from previous runs of the course that there was a focus on gaming and I did not get disappointed. The staff was really showing that they enjoyed everything about the subject and were fun and explained everything very clearly. The course is pretty easy to follow and I wouldn't have minded if it was just a little harder. If your english is good and you have a little experience in coding you will get through the mini projects like a breeze.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2399</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Awesome course!

So I came to the course with a basic understanding of some elements of programming (e.g. loops, variables), but with no experience in others that were covered in this course (e.g. object oriented programming, draw handlers, keyboard/mouse input). Compared to the other MOOC courses I've taken (also Coursera - Gamification, Social Network Analysis), this course was my favourite (although I enjoyed the others also). It definitely has a heavier workload (mainly on coding using the web-based "Code Skulptor" tool that the profs developed and provide for use in the course). Likes: \- Effective, engaging teachers who use the video tutorials effectively \- Excellent web-based programming tool \- Very active discussion boards and forums \- Good additional learning exercises \- Multiple levels of support when coding including one-on-one feedback on your code, if needed, to help it get working \- Good level of difficulty - definitely challenging but doable. Note - some people felt that this course was too difficult for true beginners with absolutely no programming experience. And many people found that the workload was greater than indicated in the course outline. This wasn't my experience, but learners should know going in that you do have to put the work in to succeed at this course. Dislikes: \- Nothing major, but the weekly quizzes sometimes seemed like they could have been omitted since so much of the real focus was on the coding projects</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2395</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>With only a small (failing) background in programming, I tried this course as a last-ditch effort to see if I could possibly get my head around programming....it worked. I learnt so much, and in just 8 weeks I've signed up to more programming courses as a result of the confidence and experience I've gained here. The lecture videos are great. Entertaining (filled with 'dad jokes' but that's just IT teachers I think!) and usually well paced. Having 3 different lecturers every week is quite useful as they do have different teaching styles. The assessment is based on quizzes and peer-reviewed projects each week. The quizzes are not really tests, a lot of the questions are more like worksheets where you are given a new problem and asked to look up the docs, write a small program and give the answer, etc. Actually a surprisingly good way to learn, and the quizzes can be resubmitted so this works as a learning tool. Peer reviewing made me the most nervous, but I was happy to not have machine grading. My university courses were like that, and I think that's why I failed. Slight variations are accounted for in peer review, and I have to say I learnt the most when reviewing other people's broken code! Because I am new to Python, I really wanted to figure out what was going wrong and help the other students get to the answer, so I spent a lot of time reviewing. I was able to do quite well on all the assignments, so I didn't really get much feedback other than 'well done', but I do know from the forums that some experienced students were taking the time to leave comments on how to improve even if the grade was 100%. I've since started a couple of other online courses, some on Coursera, and this one is by FAR the most organized. It's not perfect of course, but the vast majority of material is proof-read, verified and tested, and unfortunately this can't be said of other courses. I think the key here is that the teachers really love teaching this course, and programming in general. It comes across in their videos, in their presence on the forums, and in the course itself. University or MOOC, this is the most important and rarest thing to find. If you're interested in programming even a little bit, I can't recommend this course enough.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2394</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I started as a beginning programmer and this class helped me to become much more confident in my abilities to write code and programs!

The class started off easy enough but progressed at a quick pace to become challenging in the third of fourth week. The weekly quizzes are interesting and are more like homework in the sense many of the questions require research and programming in order to respond. The Python environment "CodeSkulpter" makes experimenting easy by eliminating the save/upload/try/repeat steps. The lectures are not dry as one might expect in a programming course. The professors are having fun and their enthusiasm is contagious, but they always remain quite professional. I'm very happy I spent the time and effort to complete this course.

Although I hav some experience in scripting, mainly in Perl and VB, I've always wanted to take that experience a bit further, and being a games enthusiast, I've always wanted to know how games were written. So, 9 weeks ago I took the plunge. Quite honestly, it was one of the best things I've done in recent year. Yes, it was difficult, and there were times when I was about to give up, especially due to the amount of time the mini-projects took (I'm a family man with a full time job in law enforcement). But I'm glad I stuck it out until the end. The experience was very rewarding. So what were the positives? The online environment including the Codeskulptor (where your Python programs are written and executed in), the discussion forums, and the way everything is integrated( I'm not sure if this is a coursera thing or it's particular to this course/Rice Uni. The community of TAs that helped out if you got stuck, were absolutely fantastic and gave you just the right amount of help, without being condescending (especially Danilil Sokolov – he Rocked!) . Other positives were the video lectures, that were done extremely professionally, always humorous, never boring. Were there any negatives? Perhaps one. I felt that doing a mini-project every week took a huge chunk of time out of my schedule/family life, and I wasn't spending adequate time learning some of the concepts thoroughly enough in order just to get the project completed. Apart from that, it really is a great course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2376</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I really enjoy the course.

I've taken a number of other MOOC courses up till now and this ranks right up there as among the best of them. I really do appreciate the amount of time and effort it takes to produce something like this, and the fact that it's completely free makes it just that much better. If all university lecturers were as passionate (and entertaining too!) about their jobs as these guys were, there would probably be less dropouts and failure rates among students. I take my hat off to Joe, Scott, John, and Stephen. Not that I actually wear hats, but that's another matter entirely. Now about the course material and content itself, I already was fairly familiar with Python and also with Python GUI programming at my workplace, so it wasn't really difficult for me. However, for a newcomer or beginning programmer, the content moves fairly quickly from the very basics to object-oriented programming (OOP) in six or seven weeks. I remember it took me a lot longer than that to grasp OOP, and if there's a small critique that I could make, it's that there may not be enough material here to sufficiently teach the beginning student regarding OOP. Then again, this class isn't primarily about teaching Python in the purest sense, but rather about teaching interactive applications using Python (and CodeSkulptor) as a medium. There are plenty of material and content out there on the Web that teaches Python, but as the subject of programming can be seen as a rather dry subject, even informative and comprehensive material could be ignored by many learners due to tedium or boredom. I believe that the chosen subject of interactive programming here is to pique and hold the student's interest, as well as display the possibilities that could be achieved from the knowledge learned. And I haven't even begun to expound on the entertaining antics that the professors indulge in in the course videos - it's clear that they are having their share of the fun too in the making of this course. When you can see that the teachers themselves are having fun, as far as I am concerned, it just makes the learning process for the students a whole lot more fun as well. In the end, I believe that that was the aim of this course; to deliver a fun, memorable, and useful learning experience for the student. Did they succeed? Well, I think my rating as well as others' here says it all ;)</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2368</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I am a computer software engineer with no experience with Phyton.

With that said I would like to confess that the class did strengthen a lot of fundamental concepts that I might had skipped before or ignored to explore. The instructors were fantastic, and I loved the way the concepts/content were wrapped around fun game assignments. I had not done much of graphics programming before, and thus the philosophy of the course/assignments were the best way to hone these techniques. I would definitely recommend this course to everyone from no skills in programming to relatively high skills in programming. This course has a something for everyone.

The instructors did a great job with the video lectures, quizzes, and projects. It should take 8-10 hours to complete the required work each week--a little less at the beginning. There are a variety of games to be produced in this class, including Memory, Blackjack, Pong, and the final project, Asteroids. If you don't have any experience in this area or have trouble with logic and math, you may find yourself trolling the forums (which are very helpful) for hours and/or getting frustrated. I'm sure that many people quit taking the course for one reason or another, but I'm so glad that I persevered and completed it!

The teachers were really engaging, seemed to have fun but also get through a lot of material. They also did a lot of prep work in building tools that made the course workable so students could focus on learning rather than messing around with getting software to work. The pace is good, and there is room to do just the minimum, which is good for many, or go a bit deeper when you felt comfortable. The assignments were fun (if you like computer games) and the progression in complexity was well staged and very rewarding. This is a great course for an introduction to programming and/or python for anyone.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2355</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>AWESOME!!!!

The teaching staff is really great and gives us enjoyable, thorough and precise lessons about coding with Python. It may seemed a bit rushed for a TOTAL beginner, but still doable (in case you never coded, though, take my advice and do the excellent Python track on Codecademy: you will get things done here in a much smoother way), while even more advanced user will fine interest if not a big challenge in programming their own version of some classic game (even two arcade cults from the golden age!).

This course when compared with others is somewhat more user-friendly because I went from generating programs with 1 line to a dozen hundred lines of code, Of course occasionally there were a few difficulties but they were gone in a matter of hours due to its helpful community and this was the first coursera course that I had completely finished(from a whole of three) I guess that was due to proper organization by the course staff The best thing that I love about this class was its simpilicity, organization and support(both by community and staff) for example once I got stuck with this mini-project therefore I submitted it to the codeclinic(a place where you submit in case of an fatal error) and guess what, I got a reply within 15 minutes and after an hour I completed the project but the only complaint I can arguably think of is that it could have stretched for a couple of more weeks so I can spend some more time learning incredible things since I have enough time. Overall this course was far by the most interesting, FUN, complete course ever. I thank the course staff especially (Mr. Joe and Mr. Scott) I HIGHLY recommend this course to everyone interested in programming!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2342</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I have only a basic level of programming (a few courses, almost 10 years ago).

What is out there is somewhat confusing and lacks bottom-up approach overview. This course really solved that for me. The course teachers are very enthusiastic and very motivating, and the practical exercises are not only very instructive, but also fun to do. There is even a great tool, called codesculptor, that allows you to play around on your own in Python, without first having to read tons of manuals and installing difficult things on our PC. I actually keep using that for small experiments and tests while writing 'real' code.

Having no background knowledge prior to enrolling, I feellt I walked away with a wealth of data that could be utilized through ongoing practice, usage, and exploration. I enjoyed the forum boards, I found the people there were helpful and provide much need insight to debugging and explain codes in another way. The online lecture videos were manageable for time constraints and each professor articulate ideas with intellectual charisma and foward-thinking structures, that made it easy to enter into new concepts in a functional way. My only complaints if I have to give a contrast is the limitations of the templates in breaking down more advanced concepts of wiring up a programs parts which added to the time constraints for taking this course. Also, it would be another bonus to have had more examples of games to build, or a running user library for some of the more basic ways to setup and shift Codeskulptur to the wide-group of developers and builders enrolled. OVerall though, a great course.

I understand that for beginning programmers, instructions like "implement X in function Y to do Z" are probably necessary, but it would have been nice to have the general problem description and the step-by-step breakdown separated in some way.

I enjoyed the class, and it quickly brought me to a level where I can use Python on the job. In interactions with other students on the class forums, I saw people with no previous programming experience complete the class and learn Python effectively. They may have had to struggle a little, and put in more time, but the support was there to let them succeed. I have several college degrees and have completed over 100 courses for credit at 14 different colleges and universities. In addition, I have taken professional development courses, used many courses from The Teaching Company, and have probably completed over 100 free courses that do not offer credit. With that background, I have to say that this was one of the best courses of any type that I have taken. Joe Warren and Scott Rixner are great teachers, and the Web based programming environment developed by Scott for the course is an excellent learning environment and teaching tool. I would strongly recommend this course for anyone who would like to learn to program in Python. I also think it would be a great course for anyone who never programmed before and wanted to see what programming was all about. Most high school students with a strong interest in programming could complete the course, yet it also has enough value to hold the interest of a person with a Ph.D. in Computer Science.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2327</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Very nice intro to event driven programming using Python.

My understanding of Python is still basic but I have every confidence that I'll learn what else I need to use this in a more traditional business setting. This course has been exemplary on a number of fronts: \- the tutors' enthusiasm was infectious, and made the whole process of learning fun, which is a fantastic achievement. \- the structure of the course (from the video clips to assignments) plus of course CodeSkulptor, made it easy to get involved and stay involved and inspired throughout. \- CodeSkulptor itself deserves a special commendation: it took away one of the biggest problems that I've come across with several other technical courses - getting the initial install of the requisite software sorted out. Many of us are taking a course like this do so in our spare time, and we do not have the time to figure out some arcane install procedures, which open source software are particularly prone to.

It's a little sad to reach the end of the class, although I now feel inspired to write games and even consider enrolling on a more advanced class. Thanks again Thanks again for a great course!!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2321</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I've never did programming before. I even didn't plan to complete this course at first. I signed just out curiosity. But I enjoyed,completed and recommended it to my friends. and the reasons are: 1) the course is made very interesting: every week you make a mini-project - game (not some boring stuff). you are starting with printing out a phrase after the first week, and finishing with making arcade game Asteroids after 8 weeks.And it is possible for people, who didn't program before. 2) professors and students are very supportive. if you stuck with your homework you always can ask for a help on forums. 3) professors are very fun. so you not get bored watching videos. every week they play a game that you have to write for your mini-project. 4) professors walk you through all topics step by step. there is no such things in your homeworks that they didn't mention in videos. they also review math and trig things that you need for mini-projects.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2320</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course was great! I haven't programmed in Python ever before and had a very vague concept of OOP and GUI, but here I've learned how to make simple aplications and I'm really happy know that I can do it.

The course had a step-by-step teaching design that made it easy to follow, even without a perfect deep understanding. Just do and see what happens. Additional material was very helpful. Environment was great: no frustrating setup on my computer was necessary, everthing ran out of the box. Assignments where challenging and fun. I now have a basic knowlege of Python and some idea of algorithm in general. Both will surely help me to find my way, how to go on learning programming, even if it might not be Python. The staff obviously had fun themselves. After the first two weeks it felt a bit like family.

They use codesculptor, which is a webbased gui of python. The gaming features like drawing are easier to do here than in an ordinary gui for python, but the transition to pygame or other libraries is not hard.

Thank You Joe, Scott and team for coming up with this course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2260</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>One of the most fun courses I've taken so far.

I do have programming expertise in other languages, but Python was a ne3w beast for me. And I loved it! Its simple, free-flowing and elegant. And I believe the credit for this love goes almost entirely to this course! The instructors were very friendly and committed and mad learning fun. The materials were well thought of and covered a wide variety of topics in a very intuitive and enjoyable manner. And who doesn't like games! Playing a game that you have created yourself....that's a great feeling! Try it out!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2256</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>A very good class - they don't start with the usual "hello world" and then loops, instead the focus is on building a game at the end, and you don't realize that you learn a lot of things in the process. Especially those with a little background in programming tend to avoid, say, to look at syntax of for - assuming that it would work same as C/Java with some changes in comma/parenthesis etc. Instead, this course has an aim mind, and with focus on that, you learn (and practice too) everything else - automagically! Course- instructors too are wonderful - chances are less that you feel bored, or fall asleep.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2251</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Prior to this class, I had gone through the JavaScript intro material at Codecademy.org. I found that to be helpful in approaching Python for the first time. This course was not too challenging, but did require that I spend time each week with the mini-projects, struggling through the instructions and patiently building games step by step. The format, which taught me Python through building simple games, was excellent, as were the professors. Thanks so much for this course, Profs Warren and Rixner!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2249</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is a great course, very entertaining and really well taught.

In Pascal!) but let me tell you -- this one was a million times more fun! For one, this has got to be the most organised course I have ever taken. The instructors are amazingly committed. And they are very clear, good teachers. I am not a gamer, so I did not expect to really like the course -- I just wanted to learn some Python. But I was surprised at how much fun I was having, and how hooked I became. To be sure, there is a significant degree of hand-holding in the projects ( so they felt a little too easy, most of the times), but despite that, I enjoyed myself immensely, and I did find I learned a lot. And I was actually sad the course was over. If these instructors ever organise another course, I will take it in a heartbeat!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2244</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Having never programmed before I had no idea what to expect from this course. I still can't believe how much I have learned and how far the instructors took us. The course is well developed with excellent reaching videos, practice questions, learning tools, and help. The instructors set a great tone for the class and their enthusiasm, humour and good naturedness made "coming" to class each week fun. The forums and support were amazing and really helped a newbie like myself work through code problems. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning a bit of programming or finding out what programming is all about.

That said, every single moment spent was a pleasure! The class itself is set up brilliantly... well paced yet accommodating to a wide range of students, from beginners to those advanced in programming. Technically, it was impeccable, without even the slightest glitch--coursework was completed and submitted in CodeSkulptor which made peer assessments seamless, and videos etc. were excellent in content and presentation. The course work was relevant and the weekly projects were not only great fun, but utilized the skills learned. The professors and those TA's, etc. who helped them out went above and beyond what can even possibly be expected in a class of this size. Their dedication and enthusiasm were impressive and contagious, fomenting a "community" of learners who reflected this. Between the forums and the direct interactions via the "code clinic" no one was left stranded, and even a beginner could actually reach the goal of completing the course. Take this class!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2242</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>This is the first course I completed in Coursera. I dropped others due to multiple reasons (got bored, to easy, too much work, bad organization, etc). This one was just too good in all aspects, not too hard for an introduction course but not too easy either, good ammount of work (extra practice excersises for those who needed it). My only complain is that when the teachers were playing the games to show us how they worked, I could not understand what they were saying, they just got too excited about their own games ;o)</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2241</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I'm relatively new to python. My interest in it is more of a curiosity of how things work than to use it for work or anything else. I took another class of python which made me familiar wtih terms and such but I never really absorbed it to where I was completely comfortable with it. However, this class' professors are awesome and make you think you are having a good ol time while feeding you tons and tons of excellent material. I can't believe how much I have learned from this class. I didn't think it would be possible to learn as much as I did in that short of a time. If you have any interest in taking python, don't even hesitate to try this class. If you truly are a beginner and are serious about coding and want to make it your career, I would really consider putting more time than waht's suggested into it as you will get A LOT MORE out of it. There is A LOT of practice material and A LOT of tools for you to do this with. So much support in the forums. It's almost like having a personal tutor. You have a question, well someone will answer it! It's an incredible platform to learn python in. There was absolutely nothing I disliked about this course. Lovely teachers and excellent content. I started a tad late and it was a last minute decision. Coursera sent me an email of classes I would be interested in and even though I'd seen it, I wasn't sure about enrolling. I am more than glad I did join. The best class ever! Rice does rock!! P.S. The astronaut visit in our last week's project... what a treat!!

In fact, I managed to implement the advanced techniques inside the allotted time as well. I thoroughly enjoyed the class and am actually disappointed that it's finished. I guess the big indication for me was that each week, I would spend 5-6 days eagerly anticipating the next installment of lectures. I found it to be in the medium difficulty range compared to the other courses, although I had few problems due to the excellent teaching.

I've since taken other online classes and feel compelled to mention that this class is quality-controlled in ways other online classes aren't- the quizzes make sense, the practice exercises logically apply toward the weekly projects, and the instructors bring a very human, almost tangible quality to what one might otherwise consider just 'talking heads'. (The dynamic between Joe and Scott, and to some extent even John- is key. Rice/Coursera- look to these guys as models) The course workload for me went longer than expected (12+ hours/week toward the end), but I suspect this was mostly because I was doing assignments in the evenings (10pm - 2am) after an already long day. For the novice student who is able to spend quality rested hours at this- I think 8 to 11 hours should suffice.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2237</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I'm a computer science graduate, and I enrolled my 13 year old son in this class as an introduction to programming.

Eventhough I have a solid background in programming languages, this course proved to be outstanding for several reasons: First, instructors Scott Rixner and Joe Warren do an amazing job in teaching the basics. They make concepts easy to follow and keep each lesson strongly tied to how the course is developing. Second, the fact that you get to program games makes it a lot more fun. For seasoned programmers, the concepts needed to calculate things like collisions and keep game logic, etc. are deffinitely worth and very well explained. Finally, besides the burden needed to sort through a massive amount of posts, forums proved to be an excellent way to get help and solve most of the problems that might be keeping you stuck. Overall, I felt the format of the class was just right, with lots to offer for those who want to learn Python programming and for those just wanting to "exercise" a bit. I found mr.

Loved the course content and the manner in which it was conveyed. It moves quickly and I did not always finish the projects on time but stuck it out to the end and recommend anyone who gets lost to do the same because the more familiar you become with the style of writing the easier it becomes. No matter what level we are at there is more to learn. So if you have any doubts just do it anyway.

I liked the course, though I found it maybe a little too elementary for me. This class is geared to the early or beginning programmer. Projects specs are very detailed and essentially for any experienced programmer they may amount to a little too much hand-holding. However, the teachers are great, very amusing in an supernerd kind of way that verges on dorkiness. They are fun to watch and I would definitely recommend them. They bring personality to the subject and the huge number of boring cs teachers out there might do well to emulate them.

I had an interest in Python and had done some minor Python programming in the past. I found the course valuable for multiple reasons: 1) The course runs on a schedule. I was forced to find time to do the work. I learned more in a few weeks than I did in years of having a Python book sit on my shelf 2) The projects were interesting and fun 3) Great video lectures from some great professors 4) Very active discussion groups 5) Code Skulptor provides a very nice programming environment for doing projects and trying things out. The accompanying documentation was a huge help I would recommend the course to anyone who is interested in Python.

This was a great course for a beginner like me. I'm not mathematically inclined and I really liked that math wasn't a big focus on this course. The fact that each week focuses on creating a game really helped to keep me motivated and displayed interesting and practical ways of utlising the techniques that I was learning about. This course has helped me understand what programming actually is, how it works, and taught me the basics of the Python programming language.

I've always wanted to learn to program and Joe, Scott and the others have created something that pulls you in, keeps you focused and makes you care. Their goal is to make you "dangerous". After 9 weeks of programming one mini game a week I now feel dangerous. My goal was to open up possibilities in other courses that require programming to get the most out of them. I now feel ready to take on any of those. I am now hooked on both programming and MOOCS.

This was my first Coursera course (and i opted for the signature track because i wanted to bring in some sort of self discipline w.r.t completing the class) and i must say i completely enjoyed it. The course content, the format, student discussion forums, practice exercices which can help build up the concept - all of these were top notch. As for me, i wasn't a newbie when it came to Python.. i had used it in the past (but only for some console driven stuff) and wanted to learn about the game development capabilities of Python. What this course helped me was get an insight into how a game is built, what are the key concepts. Doing this course also helped me revisit my cartesian geometry and elementary physics, which i completely enjoyed as well. I am now looking forward to more coursers from the professors. They are one of the best faculty i have got coached from so far in my life.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2193</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>It is an awesome course.

Python has a very nice Syntax that is easy to learn and thus perfect for beginners. The instructors, Joe, Scott and Stephen are a blast, they invested a lot of their time to make this course a valuable and rich experience. From the very beginning you have to write code, in 5-6 short videos they explain and demonstrate the topics that you need for the week's mini project, and then you have to build that yourself. The templates and the Step-by-Step explanations are invaluable in my opinion. Building up knowledge from the first week, you use it all together in the last project, where we had to code Asteroids. Many of the students went with extra and bonus stuff. To me, it seemed like everybody wanted to show off what they learned. So if you are interested in programming, already did some program in school or just want to learn python, then take this class, I highly recommend it</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2188</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I thoroughly recommend this class.

Though I've had a background in computers, I had never been behind the scenes with programming. Rice University's class on Coursera took me from zero knowledge of programming to the skill it takes to code a game of Asteroids in only few short weeks (though, I was completely confused with the idea of 'iteration' when it was first introduced). There's a great community within the class, both among students and with the TAs and instructors. I always found the answers to my questions (usually concerning my faulty logic within my mini- projects), and nearly all interactions were positive. One downside for me was the workload. The workload was excellent at the beginning of the course. I kept up very well for the first 5 weeks or so. Then it started getting more in depth, and I had to spend many more hours on the class than I had originally planned. While I still enjoyed the class and was able to finish all of my projects, I didn't have time to explore (and experiment with) some of the concepts as well as I would have like to. This class is a great way for novices to learn Python.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2183</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>My only experience with programming was FORTRAN course in my graduation (more than thirty years ago).

But simply put the best class out there..</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2165</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I had no prior experience with Python. But, this course has taught me more than Python. It was fun building games as well learn Python simultaneously. I should admit that the instructors have been awesome in delivering the material. They make teaching look simple and enjoyable. I acknowledge the dedication and determination they had in delivering this wonderful course. I would strongly recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn programming/Python/game programming. Thanks to Scott/Joe for their humorous interactions. Thanks to John for his programming tips.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2163</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>In the beginning when they showed what the final assignment would look like I was sceptical that I'd be able to learn to do so much in such a short time. I turned out to be wrong about that. Every week builds on the previous week and you learn all that you need to know. I've done some programming before and I've never had as much fun learning a new language as I've had while doing this course. The peer grading works well for me. The grading rubric laid out what needed to be there in order to get the points. There is a lot of flexibility to be creative in what you do which really isn't there in a machine graded course. I liked being able to add my own personal touches in the assignments without being penalised because the machine grading system doesn't allow such things. I learned more about Python and some basic OOP ideas than I'd have been able to learn on my own. I'd really recommend this course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2162</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I started out by getting down the fundamentals of Python using Codecademy. While I was nearing the end of the tutorials on Codecademy, I came across this class on Coursera, and although the Coursera course does not require any prior programming experience, it was a very seamless transition for me since I had the basic syntax down. The lectures were very well thought out and entertaining even. Good content with not too much fluff. The quizzes were very fair and the mini-projects were incredibly fun. We built interactive games including Pong, Memory, Blackjack, and Asteroids. Building games allowed me to learn programming in a really fun way. As part of the class, you also grade other students' mini-projects so you can really get some interesting ideas seeing how other people decided to implement their projects. I think the best part of the course is a website called Codeskultor which was built by one of the professors. It's a really really easy way to hit the ground running to learn Python. You don't need to worry about the hassle of installing things. You just navigate to the website within your browser (no IE support, sorry), code in the browser, and run in the browser. It's truly seamless, easy, and fun. Thank you Scott, Joe, John, and Stephen! I had a blast!!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2161</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Awesome edutainment course by fun loving instructors!

The course is accessible to anyone with the patience for learning. Week-by-week, the difficulty increases slightly, so as not to push you into the wild and away from the course and to keep you interested. From the very small definition, to writing a long and difficult class, the intermediate steps make the transition from non-programmer to a programmer very manageable. I know from my friend's experience and from reading the forums, that some may struggle to completely finish the course. The later stages may seem daunting. However, it's worth pointing out that the access to knowledge comes fast and rewarding. For example, after just three or four weeks of the course, I started thinking about the world in terms of programs, such as how sports matches may keep track of the score by a very simple program! It is a credit to the hard work that the lecturers have put into the course that makes it such a wonder to learn from. Having finished a degree at university, and learnt from more than 20 lecturers over the course of it, few of them match the instructors of this course for enthusiasm and effort.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2159</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Going into this class, I had no experience with python.

Thus, while enrolling in this course, I was feeling like am about to do a silly thing. But, after successfully completing this course, my beliefs have changed. Now, I am glad that I had made the decision to enroll in this course. This belief is formed because the instructors have tried really hard to make this course an enjoyable learning experience for all levels of programmers. The so called mini-projects, the weekly homework assignments, the little arcade games, or whatever they wanna call them were always fun to play after creating them.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2150</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I started with programming experience, but none in Python.

I did some elementary programming in BASIC and Pascal back in the '80s, so many of the concepts presented in this course (conditional statements, loops) came easy to me. I also had prior experience with calling functions, but I knew nothing about Objected Oriented programming before taking this class. Bottom Line: I felt this class successfully found the middle ground between easy and hard, between hand- holding and throwing the student to the wolves. At times I felt the instructors gave us a bit too much help with their mini-project templates (especially with the Rice Rocks game), but then I realized I was still learning the desired concepts while getting to program (and play) some pretty neat games! I devoted quite a bit of time each week to my mini-projects, losing a few hours of sleep here and there in order to meet my deadline. The quizzes were also surprisingly challenging, but rewarding, too. The instructors clown around a little in the lecture videos, which at first I found mildly amusing but contrived. However, over time I realized that the clowning around had made me, the anonymous online viewer, feel like I was getting to know the professors personally, as if I had been sitting in a small university class for the semester. This is a pretty neat trick. In summary, this class was informative and fun, and I feel I now have enough knowledge of Python and OO programming to tackle complex programming projects on my own.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2148</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Fantastic course.

Warren, Rixner, Greiner and Wong are really good professors and I hope they continue making this course for a really long time. I also have a idea that maybe they could teach more programming languages like Java Script or HTML 5. This would encourage us also to look for more programming languages and become even more "dangerous" and also guiding us to programming success.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2146</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The web-based CodeSkulptor tool really focuses the video content by providing a consistent programming environment which works well for all students.

The instructors are passionate and knowledgeable. There is an amazing amount of support from both the instructors and technical assistance in addition to your peers. At no point will you feel alone in this course. Note: I spent a lot more time than the suggested weekly workload although was more to do having to brush up on maths than the actual programming tasks. I would suggest if you are rusty with topics like Algebra, Trigonometry, Physics (basic), Cartesian Coordinates and modular arithmetic then you might want to take courses on those subjects beforehand.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2142</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I had a great time in this class and learned a lot. I can't complement this class and the instructors enough. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. I had learned basics of python prior to taking this class - mainly from codecademy's python exercises and I'd worked on a few of my own projects. I found this class excellent for conveying the "how" and "more proper" structures and ideas of how to put code to use to build games in a usable way. Previously I was hacking stuff together that would run and could do some interesting things - but it was a mess of code. This class in particular helped me understand object oriented programming and proper use of classes. One caveat: If you're new to programming make sure you are self-motivated as the difficulty can ramp up quickly. I found the blackjack project very challenging - that was the first project where we were exposed to object oriented programming and it was a bear to understand imho. Also: while many in the class were able to get by in maybe 3-6 hrs of programming on weekly mini-projects - I was not one of those. I easily spent 10+hrs on most weeks and 20-40hrs on the later projects - although some of that time was me polishing up and adding onto the programs. I actually wish the class went on for several more weeks with some additional projects because I found the structure and developmental processes utilized beneficial in clarifying my thinking about how to code. Seeing the process of how to think about the code makes a difference. I'm going to go on and do some of my own projects with python and probably pygame now - but I gotta admit I think I'll miss simplegui that is used in the class quite a bit.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2141</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>The pace of the course is just right for people who have some programming background and want to learn the Python programming language specifically.

I say that because I'm a Brazillian Portuguese speaker which hasn't done the English course yet, but that was able to understand everything and finish the class with no problems about language. This class is very fun and teaches a lot about how to program in Python, with the differential of the CodeSkulptor, a platform web that allows to program and save all the codes in the cloud.

This course was very accessible to me as a beginner programmer, and I learned a tremendous amount. Not only did I learn a lot , but I also had a lot of fun. I think that because the projects for this course are interactive games, that makes it instantly engaging and gratifying. I loved the fact that I could learn programming through my web browser right away, and that I can easily share my creations with others. The video lectures were engaging and easy to follow. There was plenty of learning support provided. I am completely satisfied with this course, and I really enjoyed taking it.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2124</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I wanted to learn GUI programming in python and I believe this class lead me in the right direction.

The professors are really good, easy to understand, and keep the class very entertaining. If my CS professors in college were like these guys, I would have chosen to follow a CS career! The forums can be helpful, too, if you are stuck. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to learn python. You do not really need to have previous programming knowledge. You won't end the class being able to get a full time job programming in python, but it will definitely give you all you need to know to see if Python is for you.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2109</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Really I can't compare this to something else, because it is my first experience in Coursera.

Sometimes I had problems with understanding the words of Warren because he speaks too fast for me. I am not native English so it can be my fault. Some parts about programming techniques were too boring for me but they can be useful for novice programmers. An important problem was that the staff introduced an ugly programming techniques. This made python a bit unpleasant for me. Contrary to the clues mentioned in the last video, I would introduce the global GameState class, just after the introduction of classes. In a nutshell, apart from small spots, this was a very nice course and I would suggest it to everybody who wants to participate a happy introductory-like course.

This course was just what I was looking for as it was both fun and educational. The lecturers from Rice really knew their stuff and provided a structured way to learn a surprising amount in just eight weeks. It is obvious that they enjoyed teaching the class and that makes a huge difference when you are faced with an online learning experience. I am pleased to have completed the class (and to get my Saturdays back!) but I will miss Scott and Joe's video lectures and will almost certainly look for some more of their classes in the future.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2094</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Real fun.

The mini-project are assignment which re-enforces some of the lecture materials in the class. I always go back to view the related lectures again and again whenever I stuck in the progress of the mini- project. This class brings in some fun in comparison to other class which more emphasis on the features of the programming language python itself. I registered this class about a week later because I was not planning to register this class at all. However, right at the end of the other Python class "Crafting solid code" also available on Coursera, one of the students in that class recommended this one. So, I registered this class wanting to find out what is the main difference between the two. I like the game assignment of the class. It takes the dryness of the learning of a programming language away. What I don't like is there it doesn't seem there are answer keys for the quizzes. I did not do really well in the quizzes for the class and a lot of time I'm not sure why I got the wrong answers either. Overall, it's a great class even for those like me just having completed another instroduction python class before this one. I tip my hat to all the professors to come with this exceptional interesting introduction to python programming class. I truly hope this is a sequel about this class which will emphasize on how to design class to avoid lot of use global variable and the unit test of python code. Thank you you all for your tremendous time put into this course. Great work and great class!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2092</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Excellent material.

What can I say? Most importantly: I made it. And there were specific moments you have to fight with yourself in programming. I have seen people giving up, but I think it's finally a question of will. I can highly recommend this course for everyone interested in arcade games and programming or just how this stuff works behind the curtain. The course structure is very cleverly laid out and the practical examples shift good into lectures. We even learned quite a bit about OOP, which was the moment I really found pleasure in it. I was surprised about the effectiveness of online learning, it's way more effective than a real life lecture, because of a slight difference: The rewind button. Don't underestimate the time it takes though, it's a tough course, if you are new to programming and chances are good that you will need above 9 hours a week are likely, especially in the weeks you build Memory, Blackjack and Asteroids. Joe and Scott are among the best lecturers I've ever have experienced and there are a quite a few (John helps a lot on debugging and write less and cleaner code) and there is a certain element of humor in this course, which creates a very familiar athmosphere. There are a bunch of helpfuls and supportive guys in the forum as well, that know their stuff and help you, if you are stuck. I will miss all of you guys.

I had just a little bit of experience with Python before I took this course, but I was eager to learn how to write interactive programs, which I hadn't done in my previous work with Python. The interactive nature of the programs we wrote made this course much more engaging and fun than other Python courses I've seen, and I felt it moved at a reasonable pace for people with limited programming experience. I learned a lot from the course and actually had a lot of fun doing it. The only downside is that all of the programs are written in Codeskulptor, so it will take a little bit of getting used to writing directly in Python. But the instructors assured us that that shouldn't be too difficult.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2052</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I had some Python experience and this course moved me way up the learning curve.

The first week's project wasn't much more than a series of conditional statements, and the final project was a very realistic asteroids game. I liked that I spent most of my time writing programs, not watching lectures. The lectures gave you what you needed to know, but only took about an hour a week. The quizzes were short, but usually had at least one or two challenging questions, often requiring you to write a short program to find the answer. Questions in the forums were usually answered by other students within 10 minutes of being posted. The web- based Python development environment, CodeSkulptor, allows students to write their programs on the left side of the screen and see console output on the right side of the screen. Graphical output is in a pop-up window. It's hard to think of anything bad about the course. I'm glad I came with some programming background. The CodeSkulptor web-based IDE made it easy to submit programming projects (by exchanging URLs), but it's not the way real Python programmers work. It's a trade-off, probably a good one, but I still can't write a stand- alone GUI program now. I taught myself programming when I was in middle school and high school in the 80's (mostly BASIC). Although I think I got pretty good on my own back then, I haven't done much with it or progressed until I took this class. Before this class, object oriented programming was a mystery and I had never heard of event oriented programming. I would strongly recommend this course to anyone who has at least a little background programming in any language. For those with absolutely no programming experience, I would work at least half-way through a beginner Python programming book first, just so you won't be hearing things for the first time in the course lectures.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>2047</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>A great introductory set of lectures on Python programming.

It has been the one that was the most fun. I am a professional software programmer, but I've never used Python, nor have I seen it. This course was an excellent introduction - much more entertaining than a book. I also like the communal learning experience by going through the course with others. Using simple games for the programming paradigm was inspired. In most cases, students were already familiar with the game, and it was fun to see it work.

They need courses like this in my school's computer science program, and they need professors like these four in my school's computer science department! (Although, I would go one further and say they should come teach at my university themselves!) This class was the most interesting and funnest programming course I've taken. It was also the easiest to understand and grasp the concepts of. The workload is just right, not too heavy, not too light. The quizzes and mini-projects are set-up to internalize and review the material in a way everyone can do well at doing if they put in the effort. You are being challenged, but you NEVER EVER feel like you're being "weeded out" in this class. No matter what skill level you are at, you will get something out of this class. For me, I've been doing this for a while now, and I've improved my understanding of object-oriented programming, event-driven programming and game programming, and feel I could be quite successful doing that for a career in the future. Everyone who's serious about learning programming should take this class!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>1999</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I had some computational experience before.

If you're a complete beginner then when the GUI concepts are introduced it might seem a little steep to follow, but if you stick around everything starts falling into place and as the weeks pass you really start getting a good grasp of it. The same thing happens when classes are introduced, but again sticking around slowly makes you understand the whole design and process of modularity and object oriented programming. Overall a great course and a great stepping stone for more advanced classes. Had a great time taking it. One piece of advice: If you can get someone else as well to take the class with you, then discussing the approach for solving the problems really helps.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>1997</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I had no experience in python and this course helped me get back to programming by delicately opening each page of the book .

J. Warren and S. Rixner have developed an AMAZING course here. Where to begin? First of all, I am not a gamer, but the course uses game development to apply Python techniques. It is so rewarding to actually create something "tangible" with what you are learning. They developed a web based coding environment that can be accessed from most devices. They teach with good humor. They provide detailed, step-by-step guidance through the projects to assure that the CONCEPTS are re-enforced while the student is still succeeding at building the project. Awesome! Also, as usual, Coursera's forum's provide a massive amount of content above and beyond the course from the diverse mix of other students.

I had recently had a go at a few codeacademy classes, learned how to put a very basic website together and a few text based games but that really was it. I don't normally feel compelled to write reviews or recommendations but I feel I owe it to Scott Rixner and Joe Warren after what they've done for me and so many other over the last 9 weeks. I've really enjoyed the projects and always found the end result to be a satisfying achievement. If like me you have no real programming experience, the lectures give you the tools you need to complete the projects, but after about week 4 you really start to need to dedicate a good few hours of time, debugging and working things out in order to make things work. The learning curve is manageable because of the quality of the lectures and the help available through the very active community. There was never a problem i encountered or a question I had that hadn't already been covered in the forums. I wasn't an active member, but the one time I did post something I received 3 replies helping me out within an hour. The weekly deadlines may not be for everybody, but I found that even when my enthusiasm may have started to waver and it all became quite a lot of effort, it kept me coming back and plugging away to get the job done before the deadline. The morale boost of completing the task gave me new energy to complete the next one, and the quality of the lectures gives you the belief that you can complete the next task no matter how much you struggled with the last one. I would personally found Scott Rixner's lectures to be exceptional, breaking down complex ideas into manageable structured pieces with a knowledgeable authority whilst never coming across as patronising. On a final point I just feel I should say having completed the course I am in no way an expert, I dont even feel particularly capable or going out and doing anything further on my own, but that doesnt really matter I dont think. I feel ready to take a more advanced course which is something I would look at and the achievement of having played games that I created (no matter how simple and with however much help) has definitely sparked my enthusiasm for programming more than any other course I've taken. Thoroughly recommended and thanks very much, Scott, Joe and John.

I recommend this course to anyone who has an interest in learning about programming generally or wants a structured route into GUI/game development.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>1977</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Great class!

I did have some background having completed most of the CS101 course on Udacity. This course did not feel like work. Each week you completed a template to finish a different game. It felt like getting to put together a new lego set or solve a different crossword puzzle each week. Everything about it was incredibly well designed, the professors did a great job of preparing you to be able to complete the assignments in the lectures and the site resources, not to mention CodeSkulptor, are great. The professors are also very funny and engaging, I feel like we are now friends. Scott Rixner IS great!, despite his narcissism (inside joke). And by the time it is over, you'll find you have a solid foundation in Python programming. I hope their team puts out more classes! I will take them all!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>86</course_id><course_title>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</course_title><school>School:  Rice University</school><review_data_id>1753</review_data_id><review_date>2013-05-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Wonderful course.

Very well organized, excellent progression from beginning material to heights I never expected to reach. I am happy that there were hard deadlines on the submission of quizzes and mine-projects; without deadlines most of us put it all off until the last minute and don't learn as much as we could. My only suggestion for "improvement" is that there be more of it!! I would suggest some comfort with high school math as a prerequisite; a number of students in the beginning were quite upset about having to deal with fairly fundamental algebra. This is the first MOOC that I have taken, so I have no standard of comparison - but if this course is any indication of the general standard of excellence of MOOCs, then this will truly be "disruptive technology".

I strongly encourage everyone to take this course, even if you don't have a strong physics and math background. I guarantee you will learn a ton about our Solar System and be able to understand the concepts behind both what we know, and how we are trying to understand the many things we don't know. My background is simply a love of Astronomy without a strong physics and math background and I loved it! If you are even curious about space or our Solar System, Take this course!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16063</course_id><course_title>The Science of the Solar System</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>34563</review_data_id><review_date>2015-08-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I have a solid background in astronomy and have taught introductory astronomy for a number of years at the college level. This class does a remarkable job of focusing in on a few key issues and examining them in a depth found no where else. Mike Brown is a fantastic instructor and I'd watch anything he chooses to record. I really liked the depth and yet integrated picture of events that were described. The quizzes were very nitpicking. I haven't decided whether I like that part or not.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16063</course_id><course_title>The Science of the Solar System</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>34550</review_data_id><review_date>2014-06-02</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Excellent course both for graduation students and for stronomy hobbyist.

The instructor is one of the best I've ever come across in my life. His passion for planetary science is evident, and he has excellent pedagogic skills to transmit both his knowledge and his passion for the subject. Probably what this course needs is weekly homeworks instead of one per unit (I may be shooting myself in the foot here, because I barely had time to finish them; I stayed up late just to finish the homeworks... and for the first time in my life, I was happy I did it). I can only thank Dr. Mike Brown. It is because of him that my passion for astronomy has but increased, and now, more than ever, I'm eager to change careers (I'm an electronic engineer) and try my best to become a professional astronomer one day (If my maths &amp; physics skills are strong enough).</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16063</course_id><course_title>The Science of the Solar System</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>75583</review_data_id><review_date>2015-06-11</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Kudos to Mike Brown for a great course!

I would only have absorbed a fraction of what I was able to because this format let me raise my note-taking and reviewing to a new level. At first, I had some doubts about the type of questions in the homework. I've decided they are more thoughtfully crafted than I originally thought. The course requires more time and application than I expected. Also leaves me feeling more satisfied than I would have otherwise. One of my favourite parts was the part of the discussion forum where students are invited to provide corrections to the captions that can be turned on.

It is neither too easy nor too hard. There is substantial physics, chemistry, and geology, as well as some mathematics; it is not purely an "astronomy for poets" kind of thing. But it's all well explained and pitched at just the right level to push a poet to broaden his or her perspective. The instructor is a very good lecturer with a nice voice and style in front of the camera and a sense of humor. Four "homeworks" (i.e. quizzes) and a final exam, which you must keep up with in two- to three-week segments. Nine weeks overall.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16063</course_id><course_title>The Science of the Solar System</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>75272</review_data_id><review_date>2015-06-01</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course was brilliant, inspiring, engaging, challenging! all you need to be motivated!

The course is very informative and often challenged my forgotten knowledge of math and physics. The periodic multiple choice quizzes jolt you awake and make you go back and review, as intended.

Professor Mike Brown is an excellent facilitator. I would classify this class as mid-level in difficulty... you will need to take notes, or read through the transcripts, or at least review the video lectures, to do well. The homework does not include much mathematics, but a cursory knowledge of same is helpful at times. If I could offer one suggestion, it would be to end the reliance on multiple choice questions of the "not" variety on the quizzes. Best practices in test development suggests that these kinds of questions should be somewhat limited. All-in-all, a very satisfying and challenging nine-week course. I am pleased.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16063</course_id><course_title>The Science of the Solar System</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>75259</review_data_id><review_date>2015-06-01</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Easily one of the best MOOCs I've taken.

That combination is not often found but it makes the subject of Planetary Science actually fun. The course allows many levels of learning that can be appreciated by me, a Solar System fan, to those seeking higher levels of learning through additional reading and independent study made available. Indeed the curriculum is the basis for his own Cal Tech classroom. Some of it was very challenging, and I did have difficulty with some of the concepts but I've been away from science, math and physics classes for many years. I did enjoy the challenge and took my own notes to improve my listening and understanding. I stuck with it due to my own love of amateur astronomy and this subject matter. I appreciate the opportunity and consider it a privilege to have taken this class. If it is offered again in the future, I hope to repeat it.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16063</course_id><course_title>The Science of the Solar System</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>75241</review_data_id><review_date>2015-05-31</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Brilliant course led by inspirational professor with great face-to-face videos, graphics, extra materials, guest lecturers and feedback from the staff.

For me this order worked really well, rather than going to the planets one by one the different order allowed us to take a deeper dive into the subject every week. It's not so much about learning the hard facts, although there are plenty of those as well, but mostly about how did we/the scientists get to those facts. And what do we not know yet, and what do we suspect but can't proof yet. I especially liked that there was a lot of skepticism in the course about certain discoveries as well, because it taught me to not belief everything that's published but to look at the underlying study. And it taught what to look for in those studies and what that means. Another thing I loved, although highly personal, is the dislike of the instructor of lame acronyms for space missions. It's those little things that make the course not just educationally great but fun to follow as well.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16063</course_id><course_title>The Science of the Solar System</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>75097</review_data_id><review_date>2015-05-28</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I am a retired ex-engineer and found this MOOC just excellent.

All in all, stimulating, and a greta lot of fun to do.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16063</course_id><course_title>The Science of the Solar System</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>74965</review_data_id><review_date>2015-05-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Wonderful course !

Employing a dry sense of humour throughout, Prof. Brown instils respect for the scientific method in his students; the kind of respect that makes him a good astronomer and can help us all to distinguish fact from fiction in our investigations of the world. The word 'maybe' takes on a life of its own during the course, escaping the lips of its progenitor and infecting the lively discussions that the course engenders in the forums. Some of the details require a knowledge of physics and chemistry but this course can be approached at many levels and offers insights to those with little scientific training as well as those who may be well versed in the subject. Planetary science is a very exciting field right now as missions such as Galileo reveal our solar system in a detail never previously seen and we begin to discover and explore systems elsewhere in the galaxy using ever more powerful instruments. As a result, our ideas about the evolution of the solar system and of life itself are changing very fast and the course approaches some long standing questions about our very existence and the possibility of life elsewhere in the universe.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16063</course_id><course_title>The Science of the Solar System</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>74940</review_data_id><review_date>2015-05-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Well taught, I learned many new things, downloaded the videos and plan to review them to solidify my understanding.It accommodates different levels of preparation by including the homework given Caltech students which is much more mathematically challenging.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16063</course_id><course_title>The Science of the Solar System</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>74939</review_data_id><review_date>2015-05-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is the best online course that I have ever taken.

If you're in for more you may go to the Caltech section. I did like this offer as it tells you what is expected from Caltech students. It comes without saying that this was way way above my level of knowledge and understanding !

Water on Mars - who knew ? I now understand the structure of Jupiter and why it must be so.

Prof Brown has an upbeat delivery style, occasionally sneaking in a joke or jab. More importantly, he explains the physics behind the topic very well without talking down to you. I appreciated being able to hear lectures from a Cal Tech class without having to study for their tests! Prof Brown is extremely knowledgeable about this subject, being an active researcher for many years (decades). He brought his insight into many topics, sharing his opinion (and labeled it as such). He also, on occasion, roped his colleagues into guest lecturing, which was also fun. It felt like I was tagging along. I know this class was a lot of work to put together, and I thank Prof Brown for doing this. I am being nit-picking in my following criticisms (meant to be constructive; I do give this course a 5--well deserved!) As a viewer, it was often difficult to grasp exactly what he was pointing at on the screen ("...now in this feature over here...") due to low contrast on the screen; scribbles already there; or maybe incorrect pen settings. Anyhow, the pen often failed to highlight the area of interest. A set of notes or slides would be helpful, as I am a visual learner. Maybe include a set of the pictures or notes ahead of time in a slide packet? The questions were fairly hard, but the instructor was merciful with the hints (ie "Review lecture 3.02, 3:30 on") on certain choices. Overall, they were fair and a good way to cement the material into my memory. Some questions required me to review the material to achieve a better understanding. I also liked the three attempts at the quizzes.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16063</course_id><course_title>The Science of the Solar System</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>59655</review_data_id><review_date>2014-10-20</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16063</course_id><course_title>The Science of the Solar System</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>55558</review_data_id><review_date>2014-09-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16063</course_id><course_title>The Science of the Solar System</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>53369</review_data_id><review_date>2014-09-02</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Great course.

I spent literally 20+ hours a week studying the interesting topics covered in the class: 1\. Mars and where is the water on Mars 2\. Jupiter and the giant planets in the solar system 3\. The small bodies in the solar system 4\. Searching for an extraterrestrial life in and out of the solar system The lessons are jam-packed with an enourmous amount of useful information, guest lecturers like Kevin Hand (talking about exploring distant worlds like Europa) and Gohn Grotzinger (talking about Curiosity), that for a person that is not even interested so much in the topic, it will be an awesome and enjoyable experience to listen to the lectures. I have the habit to write in a notebook while studying and for this class I wrote 80 A4 lists (2-sided) with a treasure information that I will review again and again. Additionally, the exams are not a joke! They are difficult, one has to learn everything and you has to know the subject and the details in order to get a good grade. I got 100% thanks to my endless hours of studying. Moreover, the class is packed with so much additional information about space and the solar system, that I have not even began to study it! I highly recommend this course to everyone who is interested in a Caltech class of quality information and a world known professor like Mike Brown - the person who declassified Pluto as a planet.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16063</course_id><course_title>The Science of the Solar System</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>35683</review_data_id><review_date>2014-06-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course covers a few major topics in planetary science: the history of the Martian surface, with particular attention to water; the interior structure of the giant planets; planet formation; the small bodies of the solar system; and prospects for finding life on other planets and moons in the solar system. I audited this course as a break from MOOCs in life sciences and computational biology, but some weeks in I realized how famous the instructor is, and discovered how easy the quizes for Coursera students were, and I wished I had taken it for the "certificate". The course was simultaneously taught as a MOOC through Coursera and as a regular course for Caltech students, and the homework for the Caltech students was much more work, and much more educational, than that for the Coursera students.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16063</course_id><course_title>The Science of the Solar System</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>35319</review_data_id><review_date>2014-06-13</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>You can take the course just to watch and absorb the lectures, which is what I did.  Dr. Brown is an excellent teacher, and as I found out later quite famous.  The homework was more trouble than it was worth to me, but I absolutely loved the course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16063</course_id><course_title>The Science of the Solar System</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>35307</review_data_id><review_date>2014-06-13</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>I found this course to be fascinating, even though I previously only had a very basic knowledge of planetary science. I learned a lot about a subject that I am interested in. This course uses the video format in a bit different way from some other Coursera courses I've taken - generally the screen is used for sketches and graphs, plus a lower-corner video of the instructor talking (other courses I've taken have used it as more of a Powerpoint to accompany the lecture), and since the subtitles are a bit iffy, listening skills are a must for this course. The subtitles are my one nitpick, in general this course is well executed and offers a lot of info on several really interesting topics.. Fair warning: The homeworks require a lot of studying.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16063</course_id><course_title>The Science of the Solar System</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>35302</review_data_id><review_date>2014-06-12</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Participants were happy to make it to the end but sad to leave this wonderful journey of learning. Challenging, full of new ideas, and timely, this course introduced the most important questions, evidence and ideas about the structure and history of our solar system (and others) and the possibilities for life elsewhere. The syllabus reflects a fresh, independent viewpoint. Mike Brown is as qualified as anyone in the world to conduct a tour of our solar system. He and his team obviously devoted tremendous thought and effort to creating this course. 92 clear, tightly edited lectures ranging from 5 minutes to half an hour, most around 15 to 20 minutes, introduced key ideas. From there it was up to us to put the pieces together and form our own understanding of arguments, theories, and sequences of events. A typical opening line for a Mike Brown lecture: "One of the things I like about the Nice model is that it takes seriously the eccentricities of the orbits of the giant planets." Where else are you going to get depth like this? Links to carefully curated supplemental readings took us to key research papers (from 1965 to 2014) and background information. Dr. Brown presented the lectures from his office, so picture and sound were always clear. His style is easy and informal, but I frequently used the pause and rewind functions, because, as we discovered when doing the homework assignments, every word matters. A few lectures were presented by guests from the world-class Caltech planetary science enterprise, including Prof. Bethany Ehlmann on the details of Martian geology, Curiosity Rover Project Scientist John Grotzinger on how Curiosity showed that Mars had habitable conditions in the past, Prof. Heather Knutson on analyzing exoplanet atmospheres, and JPL Chief Scientist Kevin Hand on buoyant rovers for exploration of Europa. Scary-smart grad students Danielle Piskorz, Mike Wong and Peter Gao took care of the formation of Earth's moon, atmospheric circulation on Titan, and how oxygen in an exo-atmosphere could be a false positive for life. The math in the lectures just touched a little basic calculus once in a while. The graded homework exams had a few mathematical problems, mostly using powers and proportions. It probably would have been possible to skip them completely and still make the 70 percent passing grade by getting the rest of the questions right. But that would not have been easy. Saying "There is more to science than just math," Dr. Brown asked us to compare statements and arguments and discover subtle but important distinctions. Tip for next time: read the questions very carefully, every word. We had the option to download, work on and discuss (but not receive grades on) the much more rigorous homework assignments being given to the Caltech undergraduate class concurrently taking this course on campus. This course was a great antidote to science as just news. Most of the information for the general public about our knowledge of the solar system comes as a confusing stream of press releases, promotional videos and news stories showing discoveries and space flight events in isolation. "Science of the Solar System" was valuable because it showed how these bits fit together under the big questions that actually motivate solar system research. The upcoming New Horizons Pluto encounter, the Juno mission to Jupiter, and the continuing work by rovers and orbiters at Mars and Saturn will now make sense in light of what we have learned in this course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16063</course_id><course_title>The Science of the Solar System</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>35296</review_data_id><review_date>2014-06-12</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Prior experience was a single astronomy course at UCLA with George Abell in 1969.

To really learn the material presented took some deep thinking. The quizzes weren't the usual bland checks that one had listened to the lectures but made me really examine what I thought I knew. The inter lecture questions really helped me stay on track. I am taking a follow on course with a different professor and am using much of what I learned here to understand what is presented there. This was the first time this material was offered in this format. I was really impressed with hoe interactive  Mike was on the discussion forum and how  much effort he put into tweaking the course as it went along in response to feedback. I will take anything offered by this professor in the future. This class took effort but the reward was knowledge.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16063</course_id><course_title>The Science of the Solar System</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>35261</review_data_id><review_date>2014-06-10</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I definitely recommend this course to everybody who like astronomy and physics, has some spare time to watch videos and complete homeworks and wants to explore mechanisms and principles by which Solar System (and other systems) works.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16063</course_id><course_title>The Science of the Solar System</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>35259</review_data_id><review_date>2014-06-10</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16063</course_id><course_title>The Science of the Solar System</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>35255</review_data_id><review_date>2014-06-10</review_date><review_value>1</review_value><review>From reading the other reviews, I appear to be in the minority, since I did not like this class. It is sort of like a bad movie, if you find that after the first week you are finding it uninteresting, you should drop it, it will not get better. I stayed for the entire course, but that was a mistake. The lectures were dull and rambling, perhaps because they were composed of too much information that did not seem to have a specific point. The focus seemed to be on presenting a multitude of information, much of which is unproven(theory) or un-provable, since the answer to most questions is "maybe". The tests often used a format/technique of picking out the most true or least true sentences from a set of choices - I did not find this instructive, only frustrating since it required listening to the lectures repeatedly to try and find the phrase that would provide a hint to the answer. A textbook for this course might have been helpful.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16063</course_id><course_title>The Science of the Solar System</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>35244</review_data_id><review_date>2014-06-10</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I work in the area of space exploration - mostly on the side of state administration/regulation/funding.

To be honest, I have had nearly no experience related with solar system science prior to taking this course, yet have learned large chunks of science from the interesting weekly lectures. Although I am absolutely positive that there are still a few things that I didn't understand (maybe the whole scientific world didn't understand) after completing the course (this, I think has something to do with limiting experience and knowledge of certain physics and also, unfamiliarity of the English), I think this course provided something that is unique in all MOOCs I've ever taken. It not only explores the facts but also the reasoning behind the discovery/inference of these facts. Professor Mike Brown loves to throw questions at us in his lectures and these questions challenge/inspect the very fundamental structure of what scientists have build up to look at this world. This course is an awe inspiring and great course that teaches not only science facts but science itself.

It fills in the gaps left by my college courses and tv science shows, and answers many questions about how astronomers, physicists, and chemists come up with their conclusions. The main instructor, Mike Brown, is very engaging, uses humor effectively, and keeps the course interesting. The lectures are short, 8-20 minutes for the most part, so they are easy to fit into any schedule. It is very up-to-date, covering the latest discoveries, space missions, and methodologies, and provides a fascinating insight into how scientists think about various problems. The best part, though, is that it is easily understandable by laymen, yet has enough technical depth to make it of interest to those with extensive technical backgrounds. Equations used to prove various hypotheses are shown, but the concepts are explained clearly enough that the equations aren't necessary, and can be ignored. Highly recommended.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16063</course_id><course_title>The Science of the Solar System</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>34666</review_data_id><review_date>2014-06-07</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I've never taken a MOOC before, as I don't have a lot of free time generally speaking.

Professor Brown provided a coverage of all relevant aspects in contemporary planetary research. The learner is faced to not only Physical concepts but also to Chemistry-, Geology- and Biology- related ones and this makes the course challenging. The Math is kept at only a high-school level though. Professor Brown also did a good job in presenting the essential history of important discoveries, the questions that the scientists are posing now and what the future could reveal.

He supports factual information with the underlying maths and physics, in a way that makes the course meaty and stimulating for the advanced learner while keeping it accessible for the beginner and the math-averse. The course doubled as one of the modules for Caltech students, and MOOC students were able to try the Caltech homework (not trying it didn't affect course credit) as well as follow a blog by the Caltech students. Prof Brown and the Caltech TAs engaged with MOOC students in the forum, further enriching the experience. Highly recommended.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16063</course_id><course_title>The Science of the Solar System</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>34577</review_data_id><review_date>2014-06-03</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I have not focused on math and science since high school.

Prof. Brown is a well-known leader in the field who discovered a number of dwarf planets including Eris, which resulted in the demotion of Pluto from its previous planet status, and his enthusiasm in the subject is infectious. Be prepared to work hard if you intend to complete the assignments and exam. For me it took about 8 hours a week but it was well worth the time and very enjoyable.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16063</course_id><course_title>The Science of the Solar System</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>34570</review_data_id><review_date>2014-06-03</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I guess nobody is surprised to find that this CalTech course is rated 5 stars.

Both were good, but not in the same league with Mike Brown's course. Brown's course excels in explaining both what planetary scientists have learned and how they learned it. The technical level is modest, but appropriate for college students with some experience in science and math, though even students without calculus and physics should be able to understand most of the content. This is one of the very best courses I have taken in any format. I am essentially auditing the course, since I started late and didn't catch up on the lectures soon enough to take most of the exams.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16063</course_id><course_title>The Science of the Solar System</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>34548</review_data_id><review_date>2014-06-02</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>excellent course this is a very good course related to astronomy and in particular with the solar system. the development of the class is quite entertaining and there supplementary material available that helps the understanding of the course. is highly recommended to take this course for those who are interested in this exciting topic.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16063</course_id><course_title>The Science of the Solar System</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>34546</review_data_id><review_date>2014-06-02</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I discovered this course well after it had started, but really enjoyed it and so I enjoyed catching up.

Once nice feature of the class was that it was running in parallel with a course at Dr. Brown's home institution, Caltech.

Prof. Brown and his TAs were highly motivated to break the subjects down so everybody can understand even the difficult parts. I especially liked that I was not just given the hard facts about the subjects but was instead taught HOW we know what we know about the solar system. The course taught the concepts, experiments and ideas behind deriving knolwdge about our solar system, which was fascinating and highly rewarding. a special feature was that the course went parallel to the actual class at Caltech, which provided an inside view into the students experiences and opinions about the subjects.

The workload is higher than it is usually on MOOC's, because the video lectures cover that much material in such detail. But it's really worth watching or auditing this course if you are a "planetarian" or"space-enthusiast". There is only one little point of criticism about the Quizzes.

Mike Brown is an excellent instructor, and he and the occasional guest lecturers are experts currently working on the topics they talk about, which is pretty exciting. Instead of trying to give a general overview of everything about solar system science, Mike Brown has decided to focus on a few topics and go into significant depth on each of them, though I found myself learning a lot of general information as well. I rated the difficulty "Hard" because for the average student with only a general science background, this class will require a lot of thinking, note-taking, and reviewing. I took astronomy and physics classes in college (long ago) and still found this class challenging.

Mike Brown from CalTech makes a great instructor. His presentations were engaging and thought provoking. This class really opened my eyes to some of the amazing things about our solar system that we are still discovering (and have yet to discover). I highly recommend this class if you have even the slightest interest in astronomy or space exploration. There only a few homework questions that require any math. Most of the quizzes can be 'easily' passed by just watching the videos with no formal astronomy or math background. (I say easily, but they are still challenging) Great course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16063</course_id><course_title>The Science of the Solar System</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>34002</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-31</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>A well programmed course.

However, a lot came back through the amazing lectures that Mike Brown presented. Without a doubt this course has kept my interest and motivated me to work to understand the issues, techniques and facts even when some of the details went above my ability. That said, I think I was able to get the concepts behind the graphs and formulas. In the end this course has changed my understanding of the universe PROFOUNDLY. I feel that I have gone from a very primitive conception to hopefully being able to read the research and knowledge coming down the road.Excellent!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16063</course_id><course_title>The Science of the Solar System</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>33990</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-30</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>I am an amateur observational astronomer and frequently read periodicals and books on various astronomical subjects.

The lectures are clear and engaging and bring the students into contact with current research topics, while keeping things as simple as possible. Students should preferably have some basic math and science background in order to get the most out of the course, but anyone can watch and enjoy the lectures. The multiple choice homework can be a bit challenging, but if you pay close attention to the lectures you can do it, and you have three tries to get it right. The professor answered some but not all questions on the discussion forum. I got good answers to a couple of questions from fellow students.

I came with lots of interest, but no background - except for a 4 week Coursera experience in Astrophysics with Adam Frank ( Winter, '14 ) ( which I also deeply appreciated ). What I found most exciting ( I think, of course ) were the lectures (esp. Mike's ) that were without a lot of emphasis on equations. But, as Mike recommended at the beginning, I was able to hang in &amp; understand results if not processes ( I'm very grateful Mike addressed these concerns ).

Easy, Medium or Hard, really it's quite irrelevant in this case. This course is absolutely superb. Prof. Mike Brown's enthusiasm for the subject is contagious. Before you kow it you are hooked, and there is no return. If you are a total beginner, do not hesitate to ask questions. There will always be someone more knowledgeable to rescue you. We had a fabulous group of people in this class, so helpful. Mike Brown is also very present in the discussions and very close to the participants at all time.

I thought most of the lectures were fascinating, and I learned a lot about planets and other bodies in our solar system. The homework questions were challenging, but reasonable. I loved all the pictures from satellite and telescope images. I also discovered some websites through this course that I'll definitely revisit. This course also showed me how little I know about geology and how fascinating it is, so I will be looking for some geology MOOCs to take in my future.

I did get hung up a bit in the math, but it's been a long time since I had to go through that; no matter. If you're adept at "higher" math, you're fine; if not, don't worry about it (I didn't) because there is so much else to absorb to get the teaching points.

A basic understanding of high-school physics and maths is all that's needed. The course is an excellent source of material for those who want to go beyond the more basic astronomy courses. It teaches not only the state of current knowledge, but how that knowledge was gained, which as Mike Brown points out in the last lecture is far more important. The only downside is that there's only so much that can be packed into 9 weeks, so many topics could not be covered in the depth they deserved. But it provides a good foundation for further exploration of the subject. Definitely worth taking for anyone who wants to find out more about what's happening with Curiosity, Cassini, etc. The one real problem with the course is that the quizzes are a bit of a mess, with some obvious errors, and still need a lot of work. But the real value lies in the material covered in the lectures.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16063</course_id><course_title>The Science of the Solar System</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>33914</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>During this course, we learnt a lot of things about the solar system.

This course goes into much greater depth on the subject and on how science takes apart the elements of the solar system, to explain how they were formed from the time of large body formation. Historical and very recent scientific evidence is compared and contrasted to tell a story of the solar system that forms the probable and improbable explanations for how the planets, and small body objects came into being, demonstrating the great variety of physical characteristics and makeup that they have. I really liked the instructor, his enthusiasm for the subject matter, his simplified explanation of complex processes, and his realistic skepticism about conclusions drawn from scientific observations in the solar system. The guest lecturers and TA presentations were also great. I really liked the detailed images and website resources shared for self exploration of Mars and its fascinating geological features that tell us so much about the history of Mars. I thought the in depth focus was a bit much at some level when having to perform complex physics calculations, but the conclusions that were drawn from those calculations made up for it in providing big picture explanation of the complex processes involved in planet formation and determining how the puzzle of the solar system fits together. The Homework was not frequent enough, being only every couple of weeks, so would have liked it to be weekly to better understand more of the material presented. I wish the homework was not quite so difficult also, and that you had a little more time to complete, but did recognized that it was a lot more about really understanding the concepts than about just memorization of facts. I haven't taken the Final yet but imagine that it is going to be quite challenging if the homework quizzes are any indication. I really do recommend the class to anyone interested in the real observational science that goes on in the continual discoveries being made within our own solar system, as well exo-planets beyond.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16063</course_id><course_title>The Science of the Solar System</course_title><school>School:  Caltech</school><review_data_id>33901</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-28</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Thoughtful, informative, very interesting.

Homework at times required you to extrapolate the correct answer. This could take a lot of time and research but that was OK for me. The math was presented quickly but the review capability overcame that drawback. The drawn illustrations need to be larger and there needs to be a better way of knowing where the instructor is pointing when he references a chart. However, the review capability came to the rescue again. All in all, a really great and informative course. I recommend it for all "planeteers".

Dr. Brown is a great at communicating complex ideas in a clear manner. The class is fast paced and requires a bit of work if you don't have the math and physics background. You will learn a lot in those 9 weeks--its been a journey and one that I hated to see end. Dr. Brown is inspiring and even though I am not getting credit for this course, he still inspired me to want to work hard and understand this material. I would definitely take another class from Dr. Brown, and if Science of the Solar System is taught again with different topics, then I'll sign up for sure.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>606</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-11</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course was a very exciting experience for me. Professor Ulrich is in love with what he is doing. That shows in every step of the course - the structure, thematic &amp; length of lectures, the optional videos &amp; tutorials, the links to interesting &amp; useful web sites. And that prof. has not only very deep knowledge &amp; passion for the subject, but also very broad practical experience, which he generously shares with the students makes the course even more valuable.

My biggest problem with this class (and why I only rated it two stars) is the way the peer review assignment and assessments are set up. There needs to be substantial improvement. As it is now the peer assignment scoring requirements are not well communicated by the Professor. The EXACT rubric for which your peers are to grade you by are not revealed until AFTER you’ve turned your assignment in. The rubric is very easy to misinterpret and many students don’t bother to understand the rubric thus arbitrarily assign unfair peer assessment / scores because they haven’t bother to read or don’t understand the instructions for scoring. Peers also score you without leaving any feedback what so ever. Your next assignments for developing your design project are supposed to build off the feedback you receive from your peers. In my case -- out of a potential of 35 reviewers feedback comments spread out over the 7 assignments, I received very few useful feedbacks and the vast majority of peer reviewers left no feedback comment at all! Since your grade for this course is entirely 100% determined by the scores your peers give you, this is a sad disappointment that so few peers take the time to write even one sentence of feedback! Counting on peer feedback is pretty much useless for the most part. As long as peer feedback and your final course grade have little meaning or value to you then you’ll have a lot of fun putting LOTS of hours and work to get through all 7 assignments. You will have learned something from the lectures and the hard work you put in and I suppose that is the point after all. +++ One last remark. Please note: This class took a very long time to issue the Statement of Accomplishment. It only arrived today Jan. 12. The class ended Dec.12. So plan for possible delays waiting for your Statement of Accomplishment to arrive -- no interim word was offered while waiting those 30 days either. Hope no one was in a rush!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>2560</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-20</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I have over 25 years experience managing development and maintenance of Software Products. No formal training in industrial design. I took this course to learn about a more general approach to designing and creating "artifacts in society", not necessarily physical objects nor for commercial purposes.I enjoyed the lucid and stimulating presentation of material, the challenge of identifying a problem and then the bigger challenge of exploring different solutions. I thoroughly enjoyed relearning the basic drawing methods, submitting the exercises, creating the prototype, testing it, improving it. I especially appreciated the presentations about aesthetics and the discussion of "left side brain and right side brain " approaches to design (both valid and both needed).

I'd compare this experience to my master's studies in design. I liked how clearly professor Ulrich explained the essence of design. I completely agree that design first and foremost is about solving a problem not merely creating decorations. For me, this definitely was an interesting perspective on design. 1\. One thing that lacked in this course was somebody that would push me beyond my comfort zone. I am desigining web &amp; mobile applications at work, so I wish I picked something else for the course project not a mobile application. 2\. In addition, I would have appreciated if there would be more thorough peer feedback for homeworks. I tried to be very explicit when giving my review in terms of suggestions and reasoning behind the grades I gave. I wished more people would give useful and constructive critique for my submissions. Maybe along with grades, that we receive for homeworks, there could be an indicator showing how much time peers have spent reading our work? Or perhaps there could be a feature that would force us, evaluators to write well-considered comments or to spend a certain amount of time on analysing somebody elses work?</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>714</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I loved the course !

(What's good also is that most had English subtitles-- so you can watch/listen to it at low volume if others are in the room). I typically set my video player at faster speed, put on subtitles and low volume, and then was able to understand and process these couple-minute yet informative videos. It's better if you have a little background in some kind of design, but you can still get through it if you don't. (They could offer more visuals on how to do the orthographic drawing part...I had learned a little ortho drawing previously---that segment would have been much harder without my previous learning.) The course is intense...notably as you approach the end, where you must submit a designed "artifact". Persons new to the industrial/web/creative design process should do a simpler project...in order to handle all the steps. The Prof has various helpful links which can help you generate a product/process name - decide what features of your proposed "artifact" should be emphasized - and get feedback from others on the quality of your artifact... Am fully expecting to hear a news report that some former DESIGN students have successfully put a product (or process) out there on the market because of what they learned in this class about design...!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>2558</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I am a Master's in Machine Design from India. I did my master's from one of the best in India called Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. Over 2 years of program I learnt all the technical formulas and CAD tools and analysis tools. But still I could not design anything even though I tried a lot. After I finished this course, I realized one very important thing that even though I knew what was supposed to be done but I did not know the methodology of Design. This course has really helped me to understand the Design thinking, it has opened up the horizons of my mind to understand design in a much more better way. And I have turned into a designer who can make a much more informed and complete design in a very short span of 8 weeks. Really, I am a big fan of Prof. Karl T. Ulrich now. I wish I could continue learning a lot more from him. You have really changed me as a designer.

In general the class is great for people who want to be better problem solvers. As someone who's considering going back to school to obtain a masters in industrial design the class was very helpful with regards to getting my critical thinking, and creative juices flowing again. Professor Ulrich is very engaging, and it's very easy to see he lives, sleeps, and eats product design! I felt challenged every week but loved every minute of it. The only issue I had with the class was the amount of time it took to address, and correct technical errors. However, I believe that was more of a Coursera issue.

Professor Ulrich is a wonderful teacher and is so sharing with ideas, examples, and resources. I do not have a formal design background although I have been a marketing and strategy consultant for years. I now see there are parallels between the two fields and why I truly enjoy both. From the beginning of this class I have applied some of the learnings to my small business client situations. I have recommended this course to many and am looking forward to future Coursera classes. I would love to take a follow up to this class with Professor Ulrich.

Have you ever seen work progress of some really good designer? Tonnes of paper sheets, hundreds of concepts, lots of different schemes and signs. This course will explain, what that is. Moreover, just after this course you will turn into this designer. Because design is not really about talent/gift. It is all about thinking and doing. The more you think, the more you need to structure all this information. And prof. Ulrich, the teacher of this course, will give you an exact algorithm you should follow to do outstanding designs.

Actually every time I was watching Karl's video I felt that I am listening to his lecture in person. I think that assignement load and evaluation were pretty fair.

Creation of Artifacts in Society from Warton is an engaging MOOC that can give a lot to anyone seriously following the course; whether a beginner or a trained designer like myself. In 5 week I could feel I have made a substantial progress in the understanding of my role and of the logic behind what I do; as a result I have become a better professional and my clients will be better served by the kind of work I'll be doing from now on. My engagement with the course is in great part due to the meaningful way of transmitting the essence of what professor Ulrich is trying to convey. I'm sure there are lots of us out there experiencing the same sense of understanding of the subject that previously felt either the result of inherent talent or a highly codified system of processes. The work of professor Ulrich is excellent and his teaching skills convey the concepts behind the logic of design with explicit videos, a good text to follow and a powerful and convincing method to teach on-line. The exercises provided and the sequence of their development make it very engaging for us. I'm personally studying with the book courteously provided by the course and will look forward to purchase his best seller Product Design and Development. A true gift to society, this wonderful initiative from the University of Pennsylvania and Professor Ulrich should continue over the years. It is a real demonstration of a deep desire to move towards an even greater influence in society and give access to high level knowledge to people like me all around the world. What a hand pick of universities in the US are doing is compelling and demonstrates clearly their desire to create a better tomorrow, today.

The peer grading system definitely needs to be revised. As for me I didn't get unfair grades, but the comments while grading need to be mandatory, otherwise it's not clear how you can improve your work. There should be some kind of preliminary training how to grade peer's works before the first assignment.

Broken up into small chunks. Book is free and offers text version (and more detail about) the topics covered in the video's. The videos provide interesting content that taught me a lot about design -- using lots of practical examples. Though the videos do using talking head, they also show lots of other artifacts, show examples of assignments, show spreadsheets, etc. The instructor is extremely knowledgeable and successful in his field, yet is able to break it down and explain it in simple terms. He does NOT sound like a boring academic, but a practical person with experience explaining how to do what he clearly has a passion for. The assignments are practical and clearly explained. However, be warned -- this is a time consuming course because you actually design a product and go through all the steps rigorously. You are warned upfront about what you will need, so it is not a surprise. I did not do the assignments, just watched the lectures, and now am looking at the final products that are posted.

Given that reality, I wouldn't recommend the course to anyone who has little experience or interest in web design.

That is my suggestion for your skillfully next course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>73548</review_data_id><review_date>2015-03-17</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>his voice and prosody are just bad, and the voice volume is always going up with strange noises and down with the things that I'm supposed to hear...I know that the course is free and probably is better than nothing but for me it's bad for my ears and so I dropped</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>61234</review_data_id><review_date>2014-12-14</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course is my first online experience.

Everything was perfectly explained through videos and some reading and I really loved it. I would recommend it to anybody who loves design, even for people like me who had only informal exposure to design. The only thing I would improve is the support for some external tools like the darwinator or weebly.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>36806</review_data_id><review_date>2014-06-26</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Thoroughly enjoyed the hands-on project work in the course. Professor Karl teaches design thinking by breaking down the gap into categorized user needs, which are then refined through the course duration to produce the beta product - in a gist, it is a creative class taught with a scientific approach! The lectures cover the design thinking methodology explained in Professor Karl's book, being exhaustive yet objective at the same time. I would highly recommend this course, more so to the engineering majors who have now taken upon product and general management responsibilities.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>36142</review_data_id><review_date>2014-06-21</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Best Coursera class I've taken. Great instructor videos, assignments, and overall approach. I'm already a designer, but this allowed me to grow my skills in areas that I don't typically work. It also provides a great background on how to approach design thinking. The core of this course is a design project which evolves incrementally over the weeks.

You really get a sense that Professor Ulrich cares about design, which is infectious. The pacing and setup of the course is also a real motivator, and I had a great time exploring Design theory and process, and going through all of my iterative stages. It's a process that serves well for use on other endeavors outside this course, and I am stoked that I chose it!

I LOVED this course even though I have no plan to become a designer. I took it for insight into problem solving as designers "do" it. I got that and much more. I learned how to design a website and I learned how to draw. Course is put together so logically. I learned about the economics of designing and producing a product. I learned why NAFTA makes a difference in the cost of a toothbrush. I looked forward every week to the next session. I even ended up designing a solution to quickly getting Scrabble tiles back in the bag at the end of the game without dropping a single tile on the floor!

I have had no formal exposure to design, and took the course for the love of it. The best features of the course were the passion and commitment Prof. Ulrich brought to the course, the wide varieties of examples chosen, and for all the practical tips.

Even though I have no background in design, the videos were interesting, full of information, which was delivered in a clear and thoughtful way. We learned about all the important stages of design, and even got information regarding entrepreneurship in design. Professor Ulrich is a wonderful teacher, he transmits the concepts in a simple way, so even people like me with no related background could grasp them easily. There was plenty of motivation during the eight weeks. I loved it and I'm sad it's over! There were some difficulties with the peer reviews at the beginning of the course, but they were corrected on time. Some of the information about grading was not clear form the start, but this was also amended. This few glitches were unsubstantial.

Many of the fundamentals that Dr. Ulrich covered are aligned with my previous training. The training this class provides can apply to any facet of design but my project was based on a product design project-- something for which I had no formal training. I found this extremely challenging, but in the best way possible. This course forced me to think even further outside the box than I do already. If there is one regret, it would be that my busy work schedule and long daily commute kept me from spending as much time as I would have liked on this class, and therefore, took up lots of my weekend time. But it was still worth it. I highly recommend this for serious designers and problem solvers.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>2608</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-23</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Fast paced but stimulating, this course whirls you through the design process to end up with a prototype for a need you have identified.

I came to it with a strong interest in design, but no formal training. I am leaving it with a bunch of new tools and techniques for design and problem solving, confidence that I can approach design problems competently effectively, and a passion and drive to continue along a design- oriented career path. The course itself is well designed to build learning week to week and to take the student through a complete design process for a self-selected project. This was my first MOOC, and one aspect of the course that I did not expect but really loved was the role of the diverse student community in discussing, evaluating each others' work, and encouraging each other throughout the class. Really great! Not sure if that's typical for MOOCs but it was a huge part of the experience for me.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>2565</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-20</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course and the instructors are f un and engaging.

Around week 3, I thought I might not be able to complete the course. Then, I switched my project to something I was currently working on (dealing with web and graphic design) and was able to continue. I felt that the course could use some adjustment in terms of the drawing exercises early in the semester. The exercises seemed much too simple for the design professionals taking the course, and they were much too difficult for those of use without much training in drawing. I could have benefitted from an entire course in technical drawing. Although I understood the points that the TA, Amy, made in her drawing lectures, it was quite impossible for me to master these skills in such a short time frame. On a more positive note, the lectures were quite clear and illuminating. I particularly found benefit in exercises like the "concept selection matrix". These skills are useful for anyone who needs to justify creative or intuitive work to a committee. All in all, I found that the course helped give me vocabulary and validation for concepts that I already understood intuitively. I'm not sure that my project's results would have been much different if I had not taken the course, but the course gave me a lot to think about.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>2561</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-20</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Professor Ulrich is the best teacher i have ever encountered.

I wish next Course to be even longer. To follow this class needs hard work but the outcome exceeds the imagination. Is a class one must take in order to understand what I mean. Honestly when I started I didn't believe that I enjoy but also learn so much. I am an amateur designer and although I am good in drawing because I studied art and it helps with my aesthetic, but everything else has been new and exciting. My prototype is not completely refined and of course needs much more work. The passion of Professor Ulrich in teaching reminded me of my art teacher. He used to say that we first should believe in ourselves and in our work and then make the others believe in us. Also he used to say that whenever we create something that is absolutely perfect then we should destroy it and start from the scratch. Although sounds crazy he had a point that we should never be satisfied by any outcome but always try to make something better out of it. Our prototypes maybe are not perfect and need a lot of work but we are proud because we worked hard and gave thought and energy to create it. Our prototypes are not perfect to be destroyed but the opposite: to be refined. I am looking forward to a new Design of Artifacts course that I would like again to attend and I am sure many of us will happily do. I also believe something else, and this has been I think the real knowledge that I got from the lessons. That one person is just a unit but when many creative persons happen to get together then in a miraculous way they give light to each other, if many creative persons happen to work in a single project then the project may have more success than if one works individually and lastly I believe that there is a way to make this world a better place for us and our children if many creative people get together they will find a way to do it even if it sounds like an utopian dream. So I hope in a future course to be able to have even more time and participate in Forum more. .</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>2537</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Excellent Course.

I especially liked the fact that we developed websites to showcase our projects. It was very easy to grade others work, plus I have a historical record of my projects. Thank you for this course! The only problem I had was confirming that I had done all of the activities. Each week we had activities that we needed to complete as well as several activites that we had to grade our fellow students. The only way to see the status of an activity (Completed or To be Completed) was to click the activity. The only way to see your grade on previous activities was to click the previous activity and read the entire posting. I would like to see a matrix of the course activities with the status/grade of the activity.

This course was also my first MOOC, and it was great! The lectures were really helpful, and the tasks that we got were always different, based on different skills and methods so I never got bored. What makes this course outstanding is that it deals with something really practical, not just writing essays and sharing opinions (which is also important but which I had enough at the university), but doing something visible and real. The organization of the course is also the best in comparison with the others that I took after this one: everything is thoughtful, deadlines are strict but you have enough time to do your task on time. All in all, a very nice experience.

I have learned a lot about designing process, and also about production and marketing. As a side effect - I learned how to create and maintain my own website - which I never knew how to do. Overall I am very happy with this course, it is quite comparable in quality to the paid continuing education courses I take sometimes. I do highly recommend it to anybody, but you should be ready to work really hard - I am a working adult with two kids and it was a challenge to fit it in my schedule, but well worth it! Karl, if you are reading it - thank you very much!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>2472</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I was familiar with design and designing, but course gave me more deep understanding about process of creating a successful design.

I have just completed the last assignment, and I wanted to share some thoughts on this course. I am not a designer in terms of I don't draw, plan or build stuff in my everyday life, although my job involves creativity and problem solving, so I was interested in taking this course. From the day 1 I was totally involved in learning process. I have read the free book (which is very well written) within the first week of studying. The video lectures are engaging and very informative, and the assignments are interesting and fun! I actually surprised myself, because back in the day I was often too lazy to do assignments when they where more or less optional, but I felt like I must do all of these in this course. I was amazed how great it is to build things with my own hands, to actually implement my ideas in physical objects, test and refine them. Honestly, it's very pleasant to look back at all the work I have done during this class. The course changed my perspective on how things are created in general. I didn't think that the design process could have any theoretical grounds, but it is! And now, I can pretty much get any problem, come up with alternative solutions, iterate to find the best one using Concept Selection Matrix, and solve the problem! That's a really useful skill that I can apply in my everyday life. Lastly, I wish to thank course staff for their time and that positive tone and attitude that they have brought to the class.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>2461</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>My prior experience has been architectural drafting classes, construction/wood working, and metal fabrication in the Navy. I grew up building things and transferred that when I became an adult. I love to take something and see if I can improve on the design some how. After about 30 years most of my designs started looking to much like the last design for what ever I was trying to improve on. This class helped to open up new ways of thinking. Going back to "school" after 35 years was a little daunting, but this online course made it easier for me. This is the first time I have ever taken a online course and will more than likely do it again.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>2446</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>That was an amazing course, I loved it, and did benefit so much from it.

However, the course taught me new skills in design thinking and product development. I am now able to evaluate common problems people experience and come up with product(s) that solve those problems and sell them in the marketplace. What a fantastic skill to acquire! This course was so enjoyable because I could work at my own pace and on my own schedule. Very convenient. What I liked about the course was the level of expertise of the professor and the fact that it is a college level course for free. Equally, there is no pressure to maintain a certain grade level. You can learn for the sake of learning and apply that knowledge to your own, specific need(s). There is a requirement to receive your certificate of completion, however. Nonetheless, it's up to you, and you can still walk away with new skills, either way.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>2401</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course exceeded my expectations.

The content has potential, but the overall organisation of the course was poor. For example, the peer review process relied on external websites and there were many issues around submission times across time zones. Multiple people asked questions regarding this which weren't answered. I'll definitely keep this bookmarked for next session because like I said, the subject and content is very interesting and engaging, and hopefully with refinement it will become a more rounded offering.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>2391</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Great course! I love it. Prof. Ulrich really enjoys what he teaches - Design and problem solving. He has the ability to motivate students by applying himself what he teaches. I was amazed by how he can explain the concepts and theory in short videos. This is not my first design course and also no my first MOOC course. I am getting to the conclusion that as in class room courses what make the difference is in the instructor.

The course is quite good, though I didn't expect to have to put in as much time as was necessary into building an "artifact" that I ultimately didn't think was that useful. I think there's lots of ability for the course to get much more advanced in the concepts presented, usually there's just a couple of simple concepts each week, I finished the course with the feeling that there's much more that could have been include in the course material.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>2380</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-17</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>I'd studied design technology at high school but hadn't done anything since (16 years).

I don't consider drawing a skill I possess, I was unsure I could actually come up with anything interesting. A couple of my peers seemed to think that designing things was pretty boring and that I would be wasting my time doing this class. They are totally WRONG! In the short 8 weeks of this class I found with a little care and thought I can actually draw, I dusted off my digitizer and got that working nicely. I cleaned up my blog/site design skills. I developed effective design processes. I improved design concept communication, analysis and visualization skills. With some awesome lectures, learning assignments along with the kindness, help and encouragement of my classmates this really make me look at everyday objects with a newfound sense of amazement! This was truly a significant mass learning experience leading to a sense of accomplishment far beyond even a traditional college graduate level course. I particularly liked the thorough, challenging and well paced lectures. Each assignment was unlike anything I have experienced at a traditional college. I finished each set of lectures excited about developing the elements to support my next assignment. I felt that the remaining participants felt that way too. There even seemed to be a greater sense of community here than in a classroom. There were several class participants that were exemplary. As someone who has hired many effective technologists for my company over the past couple of decades, I could envision immersion in a relevant industry aligned course could give anyone looking to hire raw talent an ability to connect to potential recruits by participating with them in this kind of environment.

We learned how to apply a design process to solve problems we saw in the world around us. I really liked learning how to draw in perspective and sketch out my ideas. My one big difficulty was that we were supposed to physically build a prototype. I didn't really have easy access to materials and I had never done something like that before, so I did everything except the final prototype. I think there should be some other options near the end of the course, such as building a prototype that is already designed with easy materials, or submitting sketches or 3D models. Basically, just scaffold up to the final iteration; the jump to final product was too big for me.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>2164</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I had little prior experience in Design when I decided to take this course.

Fantastic! Also, I've tried some other online courses - the video tutorials are really user friendly, better than any other format I've tried. And even though Karl wouldn't know me from Adam, I still feel like I had some kind of interaction with him which is similar to having access to a real teacher.

I wasn't sure what to expect when I signed on because I had never participated in a free online course before. The topics were well chosen to provide a fairly broad introduction to designing artifacts. It helped me view a couple of projects that I was working on at work from a different perspective, and in fact to improve my approach. On improving the course: I would sometimes wonder if all of the international students understood all the American references. Those that have never traveled to the U.S. could find Dr. Ulrich's honorable, but fleeting, explanation of an American "ism" confusing. This would lead to them losing something in the translation and potentially dropping the course because of a lack of understanding. It would be a good idea to those certain words and pictures available to be clicked on for further explanation. Perhaps the link would send the person to a wicki page or something of that nature, where they could satisfy their curiosity and feel better about their comprehension of the topic. The assigned tasks took just enough of my time (I have a full time challenging job), yet engaged me in a stimulating and challenging manner. Dr. Ulrich, thanks for the time and effort you put in to creating this course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>713</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>All of the reviews say that this is a great course for beginning designers, for experienced designers.... well, it is also a great course for Grandmothers!

Many of us would never be able to attend a prestigious institution such as the University of Pennsylvania due to financial constraints and work/family obligations. As an Art Teacher for Elementary/Middle School children, I hope to use the Elements of Design learned in this course in many aspects of my classes. I have already shared some of the "ice cream scoop" videos with my AfterSchool Art Enrichment Program and they LOVED them! I hope that Professor Ulrich will offer other classes in the future. My only regret is not having the opportunity to meet him (and my very talented "classmates") face-to-face!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>675</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>A well-designed course that had plenty to offer for both experienced designers and absolute beginners. It emphasised a methodology aimed at finding gaps in our everyday lives and finding solutions to fit them. By incorporating a practical (often physical) aspect to realising the chosen solutions, it also helped give a grounding in the real world aspect of designing new artifacts (and potentially turning them into commercial products). The lectures were well-structured and the quality was at a high level all the way through.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>666</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I loved this course! It was my first ever online course so the first few weeks the learning curve was quite steep for me; but fantastic and challenging. Weeks 3-8 were very enjoyable; I had really settled into it and started participating with the forums and asking questions. I found it amazing that when I asked about technical issue (ie converting files etc) I got over 80 helpful responses. The video lectures by Professor Karl T. Ulrich were just perfect. I found I could concentrate on them easily and they really helped not just with the design projects; but with life!

The course is very well designed. It guides you through the design cycle even if you don't have any previous training or design background. I like the videos which allows you to take small bites if you don't have a whole hour. The weekly assignments really get me on the toes. I find it engaging and super fun. If you're signing up for this course, I would suggest you get yourself surrounded by an online community, which bridges the gap of lacking the interaction from your peers. I am part of the discussion forum and also a facebook page. The amount of energy and passion from fellow students are extremely positive and supportive. The professor really spent time and thoughts in designing the course accommodating levels of needs by offering extra readings and videos.

I'm 66, and haven't taken a university course for a long time! I did graduate studies in political science many years ago. I've always been fascinated with design, and this is the first formal training I've had in it. I loved the course, and the videos were excellent and very clear. In particular I found the hands-on process of creating an artifact with progressively more depth really useful in understanding the ideas that were presented. The only suggestion I have for improvement would be some pdf handouts that could be printed out for some of the essential concepts (e.g. the Design process, Five Whys, Design Thinking and so on). I made screen shots and printed them. This is the first Coursera course that I've done, I hope to do more. Many thanks again to you and your staff.

I enjoyed the lectures and the homework as well. WHAT TO LEARN If you are a designer or you never did anything like this before, you can learn a lot during this course. Even if I am an MA Designer, this course filled some gap in my knowledge. For example how to name a product or how to sort user needs. Thank you for that! VIDEOS/HOMEWORK I really like that you can speed up the videos, so I was able to watch them faster and than go back, if I needed to. And it was great to see what our project should look like through the example of Professor Ulrich's own (scoop) project. EVALUATION First I felt it's strange to evaluate others and provide feedback on their projects, but at the end I saw, that it has a system that is very easy to use. But it would be nice to see the whole design process of the others when we make evaluation. FINAL PROTOTYPE/TIME If that's possible, please leave more time for the final prototype. It takes time to find materials and tools to get it done. (In order to make sure I'm going to be ready on time, I had to order a part from different companies and when it arrived I called up the others I don't need it anymore. Some of them got really angry. Plus I bought a lot more things than I actually needed, because I did not have the time to try one thing and than go back for something else.) MAYBE NEXT TIME I expected more advanced sketching lessons. It would be nice to have some optional lessons about how to use colors and how to draw a really nice sketch.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>637</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-13</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>A very enjoyable experience. Prof. Ulrich delivered lots of theory, lots of philosophy and lots of practical guidance. I had a good deal of design and building experience coming into the course, but the structure and assignments kept me moving forward on my project and I ended up with a functional and attractive product that I am actually using. The motivation to earn a certificate of completion was instrumental in finishing the course. I am taking another Coursera program that does not offer the certificate, and I have not been as disciplined. Even though I enjoy the course, I've let the work slide. I look forward to receiving the certificate!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>635</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-13</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The design class was very helpful. I wanted to stretch myself in new ways, and this filled the bill. I also learned more about using my multi-purpose scanner and using Photoshop Elements, and refreshed my 40-year-old drafting skills. And I found out about a free 3D design tool too. The only negative was that the timing ran into the American winter holidays, but my personal schedule was such that I couldn't have started it any sooner. The best thing specific to the course was the idea that the design project could be anything - a physical object or an article of clothing or a process or service or a website.Thanks.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>634</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-13</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Very thorough and inspiring course.

Design. Then I really enjoyed exploring the possibilities for my first project. The assignments and exercises built skills to formulate and articulate ideas, define user needs, capture the ideas into sketches, photos, and finally produce a working prototype. The weekly deadline motivated me to keep on task. The peer reviews motivated me to produce something to make something good, even better. I was inspired by many of the design student submissions. Most of the assignments are selected by the student. Therefore, a simple design is acceptable for the project. This lets the student stay within their technical abilities when working towards the final prototype. I would recommend this class to anyone above 6th grade. Although, with a little guidance, even the youngest student could learn so much about design and problem solving. No prerequisites needed. Dive in! the course is great!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>627</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-12</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>A top-notch course for both left-brain and right-brain thinkers! Professor Ulrich offers great blend of conceptual theory, case examples to illustrate (including insight into his own design iterations), hands-on application, and optional readings/ videos that place design in a broader context (e.g., production processes, full entrepreneurial start-up). His video lecture style is engaging and self-deprecating (which adds to vs. detracts from his credibility). The notion of a class project and peer grading nearly turned me off, but emerged as positive elements of the learning experience. Both could still be refined by: (1) Giving more "look-ahead" on assignments to enable application of lessons in a specific step (particularly those that involved user input -- challenging to watch all lectures, learn steps, and then execute in same-week) (2) Creating static peer review groups so that there was some continuity in both projects that you reviewed and feedback from others. (It was actually very interesting to see the breadth of design problems and the resulting artifacts from peers -- definitely enhanced learning beyond your own project.) Coursera is a wonderful platform for life-long learning, and this Design course is a poster-child for the type of course that is well-suited to the platform. Kudos to Professor Ulrich and the Coursera team!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>625</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-12</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This was one of the most stimulating courses I've ever taken.

Hats off to all of you involved in educating those who would otherwise not have this kind of opportunity. The only comment that I might suggest for improving the class would be to divide the students into groups which they would stay in throughout the class. I would have liked to see the evolution of my peers work and possibly have had the opportunity to help improve their design through a more consistent contact rather than evaluating random peers and seeing their work only once during the course.

The lectures and teaching videos were well done...fine teacher and assistant. As an artist I was more curious about the designing process rather than marketing procedures. The course expanded my understanding of the entire design process. I think the peer evaluations are important as a student seeing others' concepts of the assignments; however, I would have appreciated some professional guidance as my prototype was progressing. Let me caution participants to follow carefully the design criteria in fulfilling homework assignments. This was my first online course experience. It certainly stretched me and educated me in new ways. I think this is important for continuing life learning.

This is my 4th e-learning class, but my 1st evaluating-with-an-exact-score class, and my 1st course on Coursera. Like the teacher's style in the video with the ice-cream scoop, it's tasty! He even gave us opportunity to design our own course certificate! The best part was to look at each other's assignments, there are just many wonderful designers out there, and their work may inspire yourself. You know, this course is all about making an artifact. You know what an artifact is? An artifact is, say, in the online game of Age of Empire I, a little thing that represents the era's culture that when you've found all of them, you could won the game. It is small, but meaningful. As we get near the End of the World in 2012, we surely need to make some artifact to represent our civilization, for the next generation of animal species to research on us after we've extinct. Glad Prof. Ulrich helped us to have the chance to make our own Noah's Ark.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>598</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-10</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Very happy I picked up this course as my first global online course! I come from art. I did have a few courses in design, but it was very conceptual. This is much more practical stuff! which is great! My peers have been very supportive and helpful. I enjoyed the Facebook group too. Overall, I had a lot of fun and did learn! Thanks! Now compared to the two others courses I am taking right now, this course is more fun and much easier for me. I would love to join Design 2! I would not suggest any course as prerequisite, because what you can come up with can be supported by various medias and one of them should be one you can handle.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>597</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-10</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>WOW! This was my first experience with an on-line course. It was an excellent complement to my prior design background (BFA-Interior Design). Time is my most precious resource so it took an amazing class to compel me to spend the hours on videos and design projects. I would highly recommend this class to anyone considering design or the design process. The unexpected bonus was the course driven global design community that evolved from the forums and facebook group. Finally, the instruction by Prof. Ulrich and the TA Amy Bennett is awesome both in terms of delivery and content of material.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>596</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-10</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I have just finished taking the course Creation of Artifacts in Society, taught by Professor Karl Ulrich, of the University of Pennsylvania, which I enjoyed very much. I am an artist/designer/educator and I took this course as a part of my continuing education requirement for my teaching license. It being my first completely on-line learning experience – I didn’t know what to expect, but I am happy to say that it was very enjoyable and valuable experience. I learned many new things including how to think about my own design process in a more systematic and productive way. I have not only learned about design from Professor Ulrich, I have also learned a lot about the teaching of design, and how to structure and deliver a high quality learning experience. Each lecture was packed with great information, clearly and concisely articulated which allowed me to approach each phase of the process with confidence. I loved seeing the work of the other students through the peer review process and was inspired by the hard work that they put in. I was initially concerned about whether or not the “human element” that is so critical to teaching and learning would be lost in the on line format, but surprisingly, I felt that Professor Ulrich’s personality really came through on the videos. I think I will actually miss seeing him. My only suggestion is to add another module, which would talk about the social responsibilities that designers have. Professor Ulrich touched on this lightly at a couple of points, but I think it is critical for designers to think about their work in the larger, social, political and environmental context. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone with an interest in design – no matter what the level of experience. It was great fun!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>592</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-10</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course was my first with Coursera and what a first! I really enjoyed it, complete, concise, cleverly conceived, it gave me an overall view on design. The hands-on approach took me in a trip from the idea to have in my pocket a finished artifact. Professor Ulrich will guide you through the "knots and bolts" of design, not only a passionate teacher, he tested his idea and theories conceiving products and services which had a great success in real life! So here you are, an outstanding course that guides you into taking your dreams and ideas, put them on paper, observe them, test them through reality and give them life. I highly recommend this course. I followed courses online before, English is not my mother tongue and some of them were really in an obscure language, you would have to read a sentence twice to grasp it, here this is not the case, everything flows directly into your mind and applying what you learned directly helps you memorise and directly filter what you are doing by applying what you just have learned. Prerequisite for the course is to have 5 friends physically around you who can discuss and test things for and with you (which is difficult when you just changed country) Great many thanks to professor Ulrich and to Coursera to give anyone in the world the possibility to have access to high quality education.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>591</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-10</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>What makes this course extraordinary is Prof Ulrich's insight, knowledge and his real world experience about design for society. He deeply connected to the students by his teaching style and down to the earth experience sharing sessions. The class tournament for course completion certificate designing was awesome and inspiring. I am deeply humbled by seeing many creative designs from my classmates. All the visual modules by TA, Amy were high quality and very useful. Last, by not least, as Prof Ulrich pointed out the impact of Coursera is tremendous, and should be applauded throughout the world.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>590</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-10</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Great course! I learned about the design process, was able to think through design challenges and adopt the systematic mind-frame of a designer. The Professor is also very knowledgeable and highly engaging, it was really fun to watch him work on the ice-cream scoop design with his son. I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in developed a product, service or idea. Improvements: The evaluations consist of 5 peers evaluating your work, and the main problem with this approach is that you have no opportunity to dialogue with the peer evaluator comments, and if you do not understand their comments you cannot ask for clarification. Otherwise, getting feedback was very helpful along the way towards my final design. Also, the final or beta design for this course is evaluated in terms of quality, but this term itself seems very subjective and relative to the design concept you are exploring. I think more specifics or examples of what "quality" might look like would help improve the course and final project evaluations.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>586</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-10</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I was interested in the Coursera concept. I looked at what was starting at the end of october and joined the Design : Creation of Artifacts in Society because it seemed interesting. I was not really planning on taking the whole course. I also felt that my english would not be good enough (I'm french). I was WRONG ! As soon as I started, I was compelled to go on, to take the time for viewing the lessons and working on my project. I just loved it ! Why did I love it and work a lot to submit good assignments ? 1\. Karl T. Ulrich is a great professor. He designed the course so that we learned a lot of great knowledge in small bites, very easily. 2\. He used alternatively theorical concepts and his work on designing better ice cream scoops. We could immediatly see how the concepts would work in the real world. 3\. The assignments (projects we each had to design) were very easy at first and harder as time passed. It was so interesting that I felt I couldn't stop. SO I had to take the time to submit a project which was better each week. 4\. I was surprised but I really liked reviewing my peers submissions. It felt bad at first but then I understood that I learned a lot by judging my peers and I got to look forward to that part. What improvements could be made ? None, except for the the Visual Expression videos . It was good and I'm much more comfident now in my ability to draw. I don't know why I don't like these videos. Maybe they are too much "look and do the same". At the end of this course, I understand that design thinking is at the heart of everything we do. It's like a problem solving process with much more emphasis on creativity for exploring the alternative. So thanks a lot Prof. Ulrich ! I hope there is a Part 2. I would enrol even if it was not free.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>585</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-10</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I loved the course!

Reaching out to thousands of people around the globe for free, and with top notch professors from excellent universities! WOW!! I enjoyed taking Prof. Ulrich´s Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society because it put together in a simple way what the design process is all about, from finding the user gap to getting the product/service/concept it to the final users. I found real life examples very motivating and interesting. I must admit that I did not do most of the homework for lack of compromise and I would of profited much from it. Not only reviewing the work of peers but actually developing the idea from start to finish would of been a better way to asimilate the design process. I did not have any expectations from the course other than to see what could be achieved over the internet, and I was very well impressed. Prof. Ulrich puts across his passion for the subject and will be inspiring to me when I have "problems" arriving at a solution. This was my first course and I would definitely recommend it. I do not think prerequisites are needed. I did have some trouble the first time trying to grade etc. but I guess I am not a cyber expert on following instructions...so perhaps a simple 123 steps to grading could help...anyway it was probably that I did not read well all the instructions. Other than that small problem I had, the course per se was a good way to get an overall idea of what to expect and how to prepare for designing, finding user gaps, being patient, and achieving results. Thank you very much Prof. Ulrich for committing your time to designing this free internet course! Cheers from Buenos Aires!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>583</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-10</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>It was pleasure for me to participate on this online course. That was first time Ive attended such online course and I can say I really enjoyed it. You can watch videos when you have time. This course helps you to improve your knowledge in design and also show you the way how to improve your creativity and move your ideas forward. The prototype which I developed and created had been in my mind for long time but I had never time or mood to continue and it always ended y the idea only. Now after this course I have the product in my appartement and I am really proud of it. Regarding improvement I would suggest to divide the ideas into more categories and people can evalulate their classmates from the same category. I am not really technical type and therefore some ideas and prototypes havent been really clear to me. Therefore maybe it would be good to divide people into categories with similar needs and they can give advice or hints and tips when they know exactly the gap or are facing similar problems.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>582</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-10</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is a very interesting, practical and structured course, I was really happy to have it.

The idea of design has always fascinated me. I'm an artist and a writer, so all creative processes are of interest to me. This was the first time I experienced an approach to creating something that was so practical. That is, not just intuitive and subjective. This course has given me a new confidence and understanding of what is good and why and how to make things better. Generally when it came to artifacts, I would complain if I had a problem with one, I barely registered if something worked really well, and I almost never thought to find my own solutions. After this course, I feel like I could tackle just about any design "gap!" I loved the course, the professor and the assignments.

The approach is very thorough and goes through a great many concepts, processes and design considerations, but the content is so well scaffolded, building up step by step, that this is never overwhelming and always graspable, thanks to good explanations, demonstrations and examples. You really got the feeling that instructors were happily going the extra mile to present a high quality learning experience. It is quite demanding in terms of time, concentration and application, but Professor Ulrich's enthusiasm, sense of fun, and the wonder that he imparts meant I was always highly motivated. I feel I have learnt a great deal, have really challenged myself, and moreover, been given the tools to meet that challenge. What a great feeling! I'd love to see, as another reviewer suggested, a second course, not because I felt this one was in any way lacking, but because I'd be interested in learning more from this team.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>573</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-09</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>i really enjoyed this course, great instructor, assignments, and everything. would take again. a lot of good insights from teacher who has real world experience.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>110</course_id><course_title>Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>570</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-09</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I am almost finishing this course and I have to say I love it and I am sad is almost over.

I originally signed up for the class because as a copywriter, I felt like my brain was stale and my creativity had fizzled. We are in the midst of Week #7 and I can't believe it's gone by so fast! I am absolutely amazed and energized by this class. It gives me hope that we still have educators in this world like Al Filreis who is not only passionate about teaching poetry to his 30,000 students across the globe, but he truly cares about us as human beings. We aren't just a number to Al and he is very interactive in the forums and discussions. I don't know when he sleeps! With the support of his wonderful TAs, Al's class is very organized and I have learned so much about modern poetry in the past six weeks. In our class, there are never any stupid questions - he encourages questions and lively discussions. I love the video close reading discussions of the poems and our live webcasts. Al makes us all feel very connected to each other, despite the fact that it's an online class and we are in a virtual classroom. My fellow students are some of the loveliest and most talented people I've met. We all come from different professions, ages, and cultural backgrounds which only enriches the hands-on experience. Our "ModPo" class has truly created a diverse poetry salon community filled with amazing individuals - including a lovely 81 year old Greek gentlemen who has touched our hearts with his beautiful essays about Emily Dickinson. I have always loved learning and education, and while I enjoyed my collegiate experience this class even outshines some of my best college classes. I'm blown away every day - it far exceeds my expectations and then some. I highly recommend this class, especially to those who have always longed to learn more about poetry but were too timid to jump outside the box and take a poetry class - this class is for everyone. You don't need to know about poetry before you take the class. A truly amazing class led by a caring, supportive teacher, Al Filreis and his awesome TAs: Julia, Dave, Amaris, Emily, Anna, Kristin, Ally, Molly, Max, Lily, Steve, Jason...and his awesome tech crew (and everyone at Penn and the Kelly Writers House who supports the class).</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>181</review_data_id><review_date>2015-09-11</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>If I were to recommend one course to my friends, one course to get a taste of optimal on-line learning, that course would be Modern and Contemporary American Poetry. The only prerequisites for the course are fundamental literacy, inspired curiosity, and the willingness to take the intellectual roller coaster ride of a lifetime. It is also much more than a course in poetry. It is a course in history, it is a course in social thought, and it is a course in cultural anthropology, all wrapped up into one. Because that's what poetry is. Check it out.

I commend Professor Filreis and his very capable Teaching Assistants for their milestone success in online education and for bringing us a thrilling poetry class like no other. We are into week eight (The New York School) and it’s fair to say that we have an enthusiastic international poetry salon going on. Our professor and TAs lead very interactive, inclusive and involved discussions via live webcasts, social media and designated threads on the insanely active online forums. During live webcasts students from around the world participate in discussions via telephone, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube boards and Coursera discussion forums. We can also participate by showing up at The Kelly Writers House on campus for any of the live broadcasts or any other Kelly House event. In addition to the live events there are prerecorded videos of lively discussions and vigorous close readings of each poem in the course. These are led by the professor with the TAs who also give their all to the spirited online discussion forums. They manage to pull everything off with great knowledge, cheer and supportiveness. We have over 100 study groups on the online forum that are organized by geography, language and special interests including a group for poets, one for professors, one for home schooled high school students, one for feminist study and one for hostiles. Many of the groups meet offline as well. Many more, like me, skype with classmates throughout the course. I’ve seen students from age 14 to 81 participating in the forums. Prof Al cheers them and all of us on. Essay assignments are subject to peer review by no less than four students guided by evaluation rubrics. After initial evals, each essay is automatically posted to a forum for further and open comment. Our class is called ModPo. We follow #ModPo on Twitter which is closely monitored by @ModPoPenn</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>133</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This class has exceeded my expectations in every possible way.

I sent a tweet to Al, our professor: "I signed up for class. Poetry has been a mystery to me." He surprised me by responding: "I hope it won't be a mystery in the end." And so began my adventure into Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry. What have I gained from the class? If one of Al's goals is to share his love of poetry so that others might learn to love it too, Al has certainly achieved that goal! His enthusiasm and joy to share what he loves and knows is totally effective even in our class of 34,000 students! Before this class I read a poem now and then and often dismissed it as being impossible to read or dismissed myself as being incapable of reading it. Now, in addition to the class assignments, I am reading slowly with newly learned confidence: "The Poems of Emily Dickinson" edited by R.W. Franklin; "Lucy Church Amiably" by Gertrude Stein; and "Book of Sketches" by Jack Kerouac. Isn't that amazing? Thank you Al. Thank you ModPo. Thank you TA's. Thank you ModPo staff and students.

My host, Al Filreis, is of the fairest, and so are his wonderful crew. I think this is the most interesting and fulfilling studying experience of my life. A journey through modern american poetry, culture, language, that I hate to see coming to an end in 3 weeks. Still, to quote a famous poet of my country, Constantinos Cavafis, in his poem ITHAKA " Ithaka gave you a splendid journey. Without her you would not have set out. She hasn't anything else to give you. And if you find her poor, Ithaka hasn't deceived you. So wise you have become, of such experience, that already you'll have understood what these Ithakas mean." So don't miss your splendid journey to this Ithaka with Al as your captain.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>158</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I'm a 70 year old OAP , resident in the UK but currently most at home in the world of ModPo now sweeping through the New York School having left behind but not forgotten Emily, Walt, William Carlos Williams, Allen Ginsberg, Niedecker, Cid, Rae, the pre post modernists, HD, Ezra, and Marcel. Then there's Stein, the Baroness, Tristan, Dadaists, Bishop, the anti- modernists, a visit to Harlem and Frost. Did I forget theModernists? Who could forget the Beats? Those of you on/in/up for this course know the exhilaration of the trip we're on, recognise the unobtrusive professionalism of Al and his teams. I say teams because although we see his very able &amp; accomplished team of students/researchers in front of the cameras what lies behind &amp; beyond them? For anyone contemplating taking the course - please do it when it comes round again. You will gain immeasurably in terms of learning about the poets but also about the times they wrote in. You will be moved, saddened, surprised and involved. Al &amp; his team &amp; the poets will take you on an exciting road which you'll not want to get off. What am I going to do when the course finishes? Thanks to everyone associated with putting this together not to forget those of you participating and especially those evaluating my assignments. Thanks for being patient............Vern PS If only you had 10 stars.........</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>186</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course is amazing. I´m rethinking all my ideas about Modern and Contemporary American Poetry. I have many first editions of the poets and books (from Ezra Pound to nowadays) and I´m really reading again all the stuff. It´s an amazing process, so much vivid and fruitful. In addition, I´m discovering poems I didn´t know and I´m rediscovering (in a close reading) those poems familiar to me. I love the way Al Filreis manage the process of teaching and sensemaking. One of the best learning experiences I remember.

Prof. Al Filreis and the team of TA's have a way of teaching us without lecturing, making us feel part of the discussion, and giving us different ways in which we can interpret and learn these poems and poets. Despite english is not my native language I have been overcoming the natural difficulties of studying and writing essays in a different language, having to adress the meaning of poems and of some of the words that can be hard to understand. But I guess that the sense of community and partnership I feel in this course, helps me to follow through and rewards all my efforts. So Thanks to all the ModPo people, and I hope this community will grow in numbers and friendships!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>140</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course has exceeded my expectations in every way. I have never taken a poetry course before, nor have I been part of a MOOC. Professor Al Filreis has done a tremendous job structuring this course so that it feels very intimate despite the fact that there are tens of thousands of students enrolled. For this subject matter, the use of classroom discussion between Professor Filreis and his TAs is an excellent means of modeling the "close reading" of poetry that forms the heart of the course. There are live webcasts from the University every week, with the opportunity for students to ask questions from around the world. There is a tremendous sense of community among the classmates through the numerous Discussion Forums, as well as the optional use of Facebook and Twitter. Take this course - you will not regret it!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>139</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I am currently in week 7 of the 10 weeks in the Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry course from Coursera.

A community that is worldwide and more than 30,000 strong. This is a groundbreaking course that should be the gold standard for the MOOC. Coursera did it right this time!

Yes, you! This is the kind of course you can take no matter what your previous potetry experience. There are students who have backgrounds in poetry and writing and English majors and those who have never taken a lit class in their lives. People from all over the globe coming together to discuss poetry. Professor Al and the TAs are so passionate about the subject and involved in the success of their students. A wealth of learning matterials are provided - poems, recordings of poets reading their poems, and more add to video discussions between professor Al and the TAs that teach the matterial. A weekly live seminar at the Kelly Writer's House is open to students to drop in, call in, and ask their questions over social media. Fun, educational, and completely interactive - ModPo is an experience you don't want to miss out on.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>169</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>ModPo has exceeded my expectations and I cannot express how much I love this course. I look forward to each lesson. The instructor and the TAs are the best. Every time I watch a video or go through a lesson, I feel like I have been given a gift. The flexibility of the course material is wonderful. You can get as much or as little out of the course as you want. The TAs and instructor are highly responsive to suggestions about the course and/or lessons or content. This course feels very agile. I especially like how the instructor includes historical aspects and alternative means of art in the poetry lessons. The community of the ModPo class is also a big part of its charm. Every time I think of 30,000 people, sharing a love for poetry, it makes me want to cry. It's so hard to find others that love poetry like I love poetry, and knowing there are others allows me to legitimize and validate my feelings about poetry. Thank you for sharing this class. It's been one of the greatest gifts of my life, and I believe it is LIFE CHANGING and LIFE AFFIRMING for so many people. If I had to suggest something for improvement, I would ask first for a second level ModPo class. And perhaps more content on current poets. Please contact me if you have any questions. And again, I thank you for this class from the depths of my heart. And my brain thanks you too!

Al Filreis and his TAs are superhumanly committed and accessible. They are open to many points of view and are very encouraging and accepting of newbies' perspectives.

The TAs, for this class, Julia, Kristen, Emily, Amaris (sp?), Dave, Allie, Anna, Molly, Max, and Jason are well-versed in the subject, are prepared in the videos, and go out of their way to be helpful. Chris on tech and the camera person are equally great for their parts, and Lilly, too. And the course would not be the same without Al Filreis whose breadth of knowledge is amazing and who genuinely cares about students and reaches out to them despite the daunting numbers. I cannot say enough about Al, the TAs and Chris. I would score them to infinity. It is amazing to me how often Al pops up on the forum. He seems to have an endless amount of energy. Chris was not quite as boundless, but he, too, helped countless numbers of students. Kristen and Julia did their part, too. I would say the class is more challenging at the start than as it goes along. This is partly because of the unfamiliarity with the software and the schedule of essays, evaluations, and quizzes, and partly because Emily Dickinson is a difficult but rewarding poet. The course is set up to give a clear sense of the different movements in modern and contemporary poetry from the 19th C to the 1970's, and the course teaches how to do close readings of poems. Al is amazing as a professor. The videos they have created and the webcasts give both a strong overview and teach how to parse a single word or phrase in a poem. You will leave the course wishing you could study with Al in person.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>168</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-26</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>What i have learned and unlearned and savored on line and my own time poetry passion as artist with academic insight to favorites and unknowns and genres and verse for words and phrases that please and disappoint abstract and obtuse made plain and how can i use this new found knowledge to enhance my thinking of them and expressing my feelings via my verse.

We are now seven weeks into the course and I’ve gained more knowledge about poetry than I’ve managed to gather in 4 years on my own. What is remarkable is Prof. Filreis’s knowledge and the passion with which he shares it. He is indefatigable in his drive for successful online learning and although this is the first online ModPo course, he is making a huge success of it.

Though there have been over 30,000 participants on this - some of whom have not attended university, some of whom don't speak English as a first language, a hugely diverse range of ages and backgrounds, and yet we've formed an almost intimate community of readers who are reading some of the most complex and rewarding poems of the modern age at what I believe to be a supremely high level. I've learned as much from my fellow-students (even those who are studying poetry for the first time) as the amazing instructors. I've learned as much about myself as I've learned about the poets that formed this course. And above all, I've revelled in the extreme beauty and challenges of language at its most expressive. I recommend "ModPo' so highly (and indeed have been talking about and recommending it to anyone who cares to listen to my poetic ravings), that my recommendation is bursting out of this small white recommendation box. Thank you to everyone who made this possible.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>149</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I can't recommend this course highly enough. The energy brought by the professor and TAs is astounding, and they have managed to create not just a class, but a community. Whether you are a poetry fan or a beginner looking to learn more, this class is for you. The class is taught through a variety of mediums, such as video discussions, webcasts and discussion forums, which truly allows you to learn and immerse yourself at any level you choose. I feel as if I am not only gaining a respect for poetry, but becoming a better reader and student.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>146</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I am a high school senior. This class is great. Sadly, poetry is often taught in middle/high school as a boring and stuffy subject. I used to hate poetry because that's how it was presented to me -- all we were taught to do was count meter and determine scansion, and we never explored poems that were particularly heart-rendering or uplifting, only what was given in our textbooks as examples of iambic pentameter and whatnot. I only took this class because I had stumbled across some spoken word poetry videos and found those interesting. Deciding to give other forms of poetry a try as well, I decided to take this class as a way of learning how to approach those tricky "modern" poets, those who I thought wrote weird poems that often didn't rhyme and had no consistent pattern. How, I wondered, is that poetry? This class was perfect in guiding me to understanding those poems I previously found confusing, as well as other contemporary/modern poems that did things I had never seen before (such as Bishop's "A Recollection). Although my schoolwork and college applications make it hard to watch the videos during the week, I'm able to catch up on the weekends. I'm very glad that I enrolled in this class, and would encourage anyone reading this to do the same. Poetry is really a great art that I believe is often forgotten buried under other matters in our fast- paced society. Take this course and discover what you've been missing.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>145</review_data_id><review_date>2013-03-01</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I signed up for this course with modest expectations -- I wanted to learn what MOOCs are about, and I chose ModPo because a friend of mine is a poet and I thought it would help me critique her poems better. Those modest objectives were met after the first week. And so much more has happened as well -- I discovered I love Gertrude Stein, who I was sure I would hate -- I learned to listen as well as read -- in Al Filreis and his TAs I discovered a community of incredible teachers -- I found that the world of people who love poetry is so much bigger than I ever realized before. ModPo is life enhancing -- I've been singing its praises since I viewed the first video, and I will continue to do so. If you want -- or need -- to love life more, take this course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>143</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Words cannot express, not even poetic words can express, how much I am enjoying this course. On Sundays, I usually watch all of the videos for the week, and I return to the course several times during the week. My knowledge and enthusiasm for modern and contemporary poetry has grown. The workshop style videos make the class seem intimate, even though more than 30,000 people signed up to the class. Al Filreis and all of the Mod Po cast of characters excel in making the class accessible, but also complex and fascinating. It's a phenomena that has improved my life. Just tonight, I was describing the course to a college friend, and he will be checking it out. I recommend it to all. (I will be completing the course, but there is no option below for that. Also, beginners will feel comfortable with this course, but intermediate or advanced students will also be rewarded by participating in this class.) Also, I'm so excited to discover Poem Talk and Penn Sound through this course (which I will be listening to regularly after the conclusion of the course.)</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>142</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I am a high school English Literature teacher in Mexico City. I also am a professional student. My Literature studies were more focused on English Literature and I had never really had a course based on American Modern Poetry. It is the first course I have taken in Coursera and it has been wonderful. I wish I could devote more time to the classes yet with limited time I have been able to do the basic work and it has been amazing. Al is an excellent teacher, the course material is interesting and challenging and new to me. It is extremely well organized and it covers way more than it says it does. I like the way American culture is explained through poetry and how poetry is related to other art. Every week I think I have found a favorite poet and I am afraid I will have major ModPo withdrawal when the course is over.

I have sat here in Kentucky with my laptop and felt transported right to the Kelly Writers House and there seems to be a chair at the table for anyone. Discussions are open and all opinions are welcomed as long as you do the work to support the opinion. Quizzes are teaching tools and the real meat of the course is the discussion groups. Such a wealth of knowledge and creative energy in the discussions--that is what truly gives the energy and the scope of this new way of learning.

There has been excellent content and material. But what has been even more rewarding has been the warmth exuded by Al Filresis and his team through the video discussions and live webcasts. I feel I know them and they have been genuinely interested in my learning experience. I am not a sophisticated tech person but I read an article about MOOCs in the New York Times and browsed the Coursera website where I picked this class. It has enriched my life for the past two months. It has caused me to take pause, read, appreciate the arts and literature, and admire the University of Pennsylvania for having such a stellar professor as Al, as well as the vivid intelligence of its students and staff. It has been wonderful to read comments from people from all over the world who are sharing the class experience. The work and commitment put forth by the staff in this class is admirable - I can tell that a huge amount of time and effort went into the preparation of the class and how it would work onllne. There are excellent resources and materials: a detailed syllabus, calendars, supporting materials etc. Al has kept me motivated throughout the process, he is very energetic and sincerely cares about students, near and far. I have literally sat at my desk in Dallas, Texas and looked up airfares to Philadelphia because I long to meet the people I have been studying with and to see the Kelly Writers House and the campus.

Al Filreis has been simply inspirational and the TAs excellent. In the hours of video discussions I've watched, they never seem stumped and appear constantly engaged. Not only has the course introduced me to new poems and poets but also to many new and exciting ideas about language, modernity and post-modernity - and political ideas about, for example, being socialised to perceive language in certain ways. I have already prompted many friends to keep an eye out for any reappearance of this course. I can't recommend it too highly. I should like to add my voice to those who have already said that a huge sense of connection exists across various countries - amazing considering the numbers involved! Facebook groups have been great for this. Having spent so many hours with Al and the TAs I have the odd feeling that we would recognise one another in the street.

Coursera is a new word, to me. Words don't waste energy. Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry? Sounds safe. Online? Sure. Saves gas. So it's turning out this course has taught me more than the New York Times Sunday Crossword; more than a Kindle of free classics; more than hanging out with my grandchildren; more than sitting around thinking, and writing, and wondering. So, I know I will think about my new friends, living and dead, long after this course ends. As Frank O'Hara says, Well … Well, what? Well, for instance, I expect this course is indelible.

Carefully organized and planned for a variety of learning styles and student differences. Modpo is accessible yet challenging and tempts students to reach beyond, deeper, and wider. The videos make me feel as if I am in the class, and I have inadvertently said things aloud as if I am there--later captured in the discussion forums. The TAs and professor work through the poems with an atmosphere of respect and openness even in disagreement. They are part of the learners too, and we the teachers often.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>183</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course is simply brilliant. I don't think it’s an exaggeration to say that Al Filreis is an extraordinary teacher with a unique in-depth approach to understanding poetry and teaching others to understand it. He’s so enthusiastic and welcoming he just draws you to him. No wonder he’s gathered such a wonderful crew of very bright and well versed people around him (including ModPo community). Thanks to Prof. Filreis and his TAs this course is very engaging, dynamic, mind-opening, entertaining. Somehow it exemplifies for me what education should be about: it teaches you to think independently about challenging issues and shows you how to shift perception in order to go beyond the surface. Ultimately, it teaches you how to be free! I decided to take this course out of sheer curiosity, without much prior knowledge of or any special interest for American poetry. Now (7 weeks later) I’m totally in love with the subject &amp; feel so extremely grateful for the whole experience. I really hope there will be MopPo 2!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>179</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Before taking this course (thanks to my daughters) I had never heard the term 'close reading'. There is some magic going on here. Al Filreis simply loves what he does and it shows. It is a pleasure to hear each of the TAs perspectives and the sound of their voices (simply great audio). This welcoming, warm, low tech first take approach with all its fidgeting and fumbling make it real for me and it never feels too polished or slick - leaving space for my thoughts to fit into the dialogue. I will continue to feel a part of the ModPo community long after it officially ends.

ModPo is definitely a course that makes someone richer. I recommend it to all kinds of professionals, all kind of students and everyone who is open to life, language, art and whatever exists between them. Open like most of the poems we met in ModPo in this brief yet delicious taste of American poetry which evokes a respect for American culture. My only regret: I will never actually visit Kelly Writers House. On the other hand...anyone from ModPo coming to Greece any time soon? ;-) (I have no clue about education levels in the States so I can’t help with the question.)</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>173</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I've been out of school for a long time and though I've had a challenging and satisfying career, I've been intellectually hungry.

His enthusiasm, knowledge and preparedness make each video discussion an engaging conversation. I feel I have learned a lot about modern poets and poetry. My experience with poetry was primarily with much earlier periods with some Whitman thrown in during American literature during high school. I feel as though I'm at the conference table with the TAs. Great content, interesting discussions, excellent guidance from Al. Two quick things -- why no e.e. cummings? I'm convinced that "John" in "I Know a Man" is a hitchhiker who Creeley picked up on the cross-country drive. One nit: It clearly takes more time to get the full benefit of the course than I recall was estimated. You may want to review that estimate to help manage student expectations.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>171</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I love this course. Studying poetry with Al Filreis, his creative and literate TA's and the international ModPo community has been so much fun. Last night I stayed up until 2 AM listening to videos and thinking about poetry - I didn't want to stop. In addition to learning about modern poetry, I am developing skills in close reading in other arts such as theatre, and movies. I even find myself using "close reading" skills in many other aspects of my daily life. I feel so lucky that I was able to enrich my life by taking this course. You can, too.

I thank Al Filreis and the TAs for your tremendous effort, for putting your hearts into this. I most appreciate that the video discussions were spontaneous and not rehearsed, that you were engaging the poems with the same sort of puzzlement and tentativeness and openness with which far less practiced readers (like myself) approach them. This helped me feel like I was there in the classroom. In particular, I thank you for introducing me to Emily Dickinson and John Ashbery, and I hope you will teach an online course someday on Wallace Stevens.

Can you believe it - only several weeks - I can't! After listening to the introductory audio to Chapter 9-2, I just have to add one more comment, and it doesn't matter if I am repeating what others have said before: the course's great merit is in that it urges us to open our minds and hearts to what is unconventional, new , different and, at times, not so sweet - sounding to our ears. it is not easy, sometimes what we read doesn't initially make much sense, but then...</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>155</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I can't say enough good things about this course.

It was amazing to witness a community that was quickly formed during this course and it has continued to exist via facebook and elsewhere after the course has ended. I checked out this course just out of curiosity to see the pedagogy behind it and was very impressed. Not many other MOOCs i suspect approach this really high standard that this course has set for itself. The peer reviews remain a weaker point in the course but there again it tries to mitigate it by the instructor choosing to post ALL of our writing assignments onto the board so many more students could respond to it. That, i thought was a great idea given the variance of quality in the peer reviews. So BRAVO, Prof. Filreis and Julia and the teaching assistants plus the rest of the support team.

THIS is what learning has to be about. The Generosity (yes.. capital G) and the sense of community that the class engenders, in no small part starts from Professor Al Filreis and his TA's, and is one of the highlights of the course. In this regard, I also want to mention the discussion forums (and the MOOC Facebook group), where the students - who come from all spheres of life and from so many different countries around the world -- add to the learnings= and build on what is "taught" in class in so many different ways. The "in-class" teaching itself is open-ended, provoking thought and never didactic. Abstract and sometimes meaningless language ("babbling", Stein, Dickinson, etc.) that can otherwise confound or at least throw up a wall of resistance now become accessible after this course because we learn to read poetry without necessarily paying attention all the time to meaning. Poetry reveals itself in new ways sometimes when you just open your minds and "listen". Or as Wallace Stevens put it: "The poem must resist the intelligence / Almost successfully." From Dickinson to Ashbery, what is not familiar is what beguiles and engages us. I resisted the opaqueness in their poetry when I read them early on but slowly, over time, I've come to appreciate the mystery. ModPo has clearly been an essential part of this awakening, if you will, and for that I will be eternally thankful. Everything I read these days, I see it through the lens of what I learn and read in ModPo -- that is definitely one big mark of impact. I have never taken a MOOC before but am encouraged by how it is possible to teach - even multiple thousands of us - via such a forum. There is nothing I dislike about the course; if only I had more time to give to it every week because there are so many aspects of the course that I wish I could delve deeper into.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>2507</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Al Filreis's "ModPo," as it's affectionately known, has become legendary in the MOOC universe, deservedly. This is due primarily to the participative energy and enthusiasm that Filreis and his assisting TAs bring to the enterprise, and the somewhat unorthodox pedagogy, which eschews lectures and uses videos of Socratic close readings to teach students not only what the poems may mean, but more importantly how to approach any "difficult" poem they might encounter. This approach puts the lie to the assertion that online learning has to be impersonal and dry. The importance of the energy factor can't be overstated. While professors of several other MOOCs I have taken have made at best cameo appearances in the discussion forums, Filreis (and his TAs) monitored and commented on thousands of student discussions, encouraging and challenging us as we explored and questioned the material. Questioning the material was also a key characteristic of the course. Much of the poetry, particularly the more contemporary examples, was not only difficult but challenged traditional ideas of what poetry is, should be, and what it does. Some of the new methodology of such artists as Kenny Goldsmith and Charles Bernstein is of the "uncreative" school, and can raise the hackles of more traditional lovers of poetry.

I learned so much &amp; enjoyed the poem discussions.The writing of the essays became easier as the course progressed.What amazes me the most is that Professor Al knew students by name &amp; what s/he wrote on FB or in the forums.He went out of his way along with Julia,Chris &amp; others to make sure I received my certificate &amp; I did.This MOOC course formed groups of students from all over the world.The students became very close.&amp; I made two local friends.Can one imagine this occurring from an online course of over 30,000 students? Professor Al Filreis kept me engaged &amp; although I have had poetry course before;I didn't know how to close read a poem.For the last essay of the course ,I wrote a poem.I was surprised to receive my best reviews.I haven't shared my own poems before. This course helped me to share my writing as others did too.

ModPo, in the same spirit, welcomes everyone. Second, I think ModPo demonstrates the art of teaching at its best i.e. prompting, showing (not telling) students how to be intellectually curious - to wonder, to ask questions, to seek &amp; explore alternative answers/solutions/methods/etc., to be open to others, to question &amp; listen to them, to discover the things that aren't already known &amp; written down, to "wrestle with faith and doubt," as Elizabeth Samet put it in "Soldier's Heart: Reading Literature Through Peace and War at West Point," with uncertainty &amp; ambiguity in beliefs &amp; values. Maybe a better way to put it: ModPo engages us in the process - the process of reading &amp; writing poetry, of thinking, feeling &amp; learning, the process of living the examined life. Other courses convey information and teach students to think critically &amp; creatively, but ModPo takes learning to the next level, teaching the art of intellectual inquiry - teaching us to fish instead of just handing out fish! ModPo should be the poster child for MOOCs, and Al Filreis the model for teachers of the future!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>723</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-19</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Noone and no course is perfect, tho this course has lots of well thought-out features. Didn't think I'd like Modern Poetry because some people just slop together words "and call it modern poetry". But, like some skilled, wonderful modern Visual artists who also take random elements but arrange them well (like Klee for instance), many of the readings/poems used in Modern Poetry (nicknamed ModPo) were well constructed. (All readings were free online, incidentally.) There were only four assignment dates and one did not have to pick a score to assign to one's peers. So tempers stayed calm amongst the thousands of us students...and we focused on the poetry. I read/viewed almost all videos, but this class was a pleasure also because of the lighter homework load. From Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman up to some modern poets whom Prof. Al Filreis knows and interviewed...it was an engaging class. And the Prof will continue the 2012 ModPo forum for a year. So some of us peek in and read/read closely some suggested poem. The regularly appearing video gang (Several returning members of the Prof's students who discussed the latest poetry which we read) were quite engaging. My small suggestion, tho, is that they incorporate more students of different ages to get more diversity of opinion. (Students not far from high school...are less likely to differ with popular opinions/or the Prof's opinions than older students.)</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>533</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-03</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I could go on and on about this course, like I usually do, but it is sufficient to say that this is an extraordinary experience. Anybody interested in poetry, online learning, pedagogy, or the future of education should take this great Coursera MOOC with Al Filreis and his TAs at the Kelly Writers House at the University of Pennsylvania. Students from 11-90, from all over the world, speaking scores of languages, putting in an hour to a full forty- hour work week on the poetry, from US Senators to skateboarders in Cali will benefit from ModPo.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>402</review_data_id><review_date>2012-11-20</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Unsure how to approach modern poetry? Well, this is the course you should consider taking. This is a survey course that puts you in close contact with stimulating poetry through close reading, and interaction with a worldwide community of students. You may not like some of the works you will read; some you will want to carry in your pocket to read and re-read whenever you get the chance. The combination of the engaging, ecumenical teaching style of Al Filreis, engaged and bright Teaching Assistants, and probably some of the authors/artists whose works are read during the course, will renew your love in learning if it needs renewal. The students, some 36K strong, who signed up for the 2012 edition of the course, made generous and smart contributions. When you finish the course, and you are still unsure if you like modern poetry, you probably will have found something of great value in the course: Hope. The course offers a community of teachers/students and students/teachers, and that community will convince you that there is great good in humanity. Yeah -- the course is that good.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>400</review_data_id><review_date>2012-11-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Modpo was amazing!

I have learned more about poetry in context through this course than I imagined could be learned in ten weeks. I felt the constraint of Emily Dickinson in week one as she wrote about dwelling in possibility while living within cultural suppression. At the conclusion of the ten-week journey with poets who explored and exploded the creative possibilities of word and art I felt liberated. Foremost, the passion of Professor Al Filreis fueled the course - passion for poetry, for teaching, and for students. Then a class atmosphere of mutual respect, cooperation, compassion, community, humor, and delight created a palpable energy that made students want to stay up late and rise early to go to class, to be within the class energy. It is not saying too much to predict that others who take this course will touch some of the grandness of what it is to be human, will identify more poetry in people and life, will enlarge their imagination, and will expand their wonder about creativity and Mystery. Thank you, consumate professor Al Filreis … intelligent, curious, involved TAs … able behind-the- scenes crew … generous companion students … Coursera … Al Gore … and all others who brought about this meaningful internet experience for me and thousands of others.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>359</review_data_id><review_date>2012-11-09</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course was simply fabulous and I'm sorry to see it end. Al Filries is an incredible teacher -- passionate about his subject, devoted to his students and extremely well organized. The use of a seminar with his TAs rather than lecturing was a great idea. It allows online students to participate in studying these sometimes difficult poems at a high level. The discussion forums were well run as well, with Professor Al (as we call him) and the TAs monitoring the posts on a daily basis and responding to student comments. With 30,000 students taking the course, I always felt that my voice would be heard.ModPo exposed me to a range of poets that I probably would not have read on my own and left me with an understanging not onoy of their works, but of the broad arc of many artistic movements. If this review allowed a ten star rating, this Coursera offering would get it.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>357</review_data_id><review_date>2012-11-08</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I love this course and have a renewed appreciation for poetry. The reason this course works so well is the committment from the instructor and the TA's. The video discussions, their participation in the forums are all so important to an online humanities course, and contribute to making us feel like we're part of something, instead of just completing modules in isolation. I think Coursera can apply a lot of what works about this course and improve some of the other humanities courses, and also seek to create more in this vain. I think a modern art survey course would be absolutely perfect.

I studied literature in Mexico and then emigrated to Italy and I missed so much to have someone with whom I could speak in the same passionate, enthusiastic and deppen way as I did it when i was at home. I found this through my computer with Al and Dave and Amaris, Cristine and Emily and all the rest teacher-fellows. I was also very encouraged about doing the essays and also about learning how and which elements could I evaluate from the others. I love the Facebook grupo that was formed and encouraged even before the beginning of the course. And I am always surprise when I see that Al takes his time to participate in it and I´m very moved also when he ask us for help, for example, when he linked us a thread in which one guy had just incorporated to the course and was asking for advises.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>242</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-29</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I had to repress the desire to give all five stars to this course in Modern and Contemporary Poetry at Pennsylvania due to an over-effusiveness in subjectivity. I began my route to the course by finding it advertised on Twitter and being the curious-type thought to pursue it , and to blog about it at Open Salon as it proceeded. The ModPO MOOC is set up so that the student can access substantial archives of teaching materials, these include video Introductions, both audio and text versions of the poets' work under consideration, healthy discussion forums for questions and comment, and assorted Wikis, huddle-groups, quizzes, and writing assignment mechanisms. We were asked on a thread about comparing this course with others, and although I had not tried a MOOC before, I have some experience of blended learning which is established on a similar, but less intense basis. I find the ModPo Mooc to be well-designed and unfrightening. The staff , from Al Filreis, through teaching assistants and to visiting poets are friendly, professional, enthused and passionate about modern poetry. I am enjoying the course because I can take my time with the threads and syllabus. The fact that the course will remain open for another twelve months after teaching and its end proper, is quite simply a boon. We have not yet finished the course. I will be aggregating my blog about the course's devlopment in due time, and I hope to condense the entire into one post which will elaborate on the experience of participating in a MOOC. In the interim, thanks to the staff and poets who enabled this introduction to Modern and Contemporary Poetry at PENN. It is great to have an inside track in how this can be done with both excellence and commitment by those involved.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>240</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-28</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Taking Modpo (Modern and Contemporary Poetry) with Al Filreis and the team of TAs is an outstanding learning experience. Along with the lively discussion of each poem available via video, there is a constant dialog via the discussion threads, along with weekly live webinars. But that’s just a starting point, as Al has assembled a treasure trove of materials, with poets reading their own poems (on Penn Sound and other), along with discussion forums with other poets. The warm, welcoming style of Al and the TA team makes the experience very accessible and unintimidating, and it is clear that many students intend on visiting the Kelly Writer’s House (KWH), and that the door at KWH is always open. As a topic, modern and contemporary poetry seems very well suited to an online course as the reading (the poems) are generally short enough to allow the chance to hear the poet and have a thorough discussion without an overly long video or audio file. The writing assignments have also provided a good learning experience and the lively conversation about the difference between an evaluation rubric and an assignment received over 4,600 views in a short period of time. It was fascinating to observe some students' desire for more structure and lectures, as contrasted to the course’s teaching philosophy of learning through discovery and discussion. The class uses a peer evaluation process, and this too has been a learning experience. The points and discussions raised in the class and the discussion threads go well beyond poetry, shedding insight into how we like to learn and interact. I have recommended this class and also Coursera to many of my friends and colleagues who are lifelong learners. We are signing up for future courses together, though ModPo and Al have set the bar very, very high for other classes to live up to.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>193</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-26</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Graduated in 1990, with a BA in English Lit. Probably been just that long since I've read any poetry, sad to say. Signed up for the course, and have really enjoyed it. Have to say that the video discussion between Dr. Al &amp; his TA's have been more interesting &amp; enlightening than any of my actual college courses. The ability to discuss more in-depth with fellow students via discussion forums added much as well. While my own personal interpretation of some poems didn't always jive with Dr. Al's (we all bring different experiences to our poetry, and I think sometimes it's hard to know the exact experience of the writer), I learned so much about additional aspects of a poem to consider that I never learned in college. Dr. Al's passion (as well as his TA's) for Poetry is contagious and while I'm still in week 7 of 10, I really have enjoyed this class! This course is great for poets, those interested in poetry, as well as those with limited exposure with a desire to learn more.

I know it sounds silly to take on yet another obligation but something told me that this was going to work. And it has! My new enthusiasm for poetry has bubbled over to my own research and ModPo has given me the push to finish! I'm not quite there yet but I know I will make the deadline.

The student is enveloped in a plethora of riches. The poems are presented via close readings, but also with reference to the social and artistic context of the times. Every effort has been made to provide the technology for interaction between student and instructors and amongst students. Technologically all of this has been brilliant. The frustrations arise from all of the above. It is not possible to take in all of the information. The encouragement to interact makes the limitations of interacting with more than 30,000 people painfully apparent. There is an urge to respond immediately, personally, and vocally to video discussions amongst the instructors. If I did not have the opportunity to share what I am learning and experiencing with a group of friends with whom I have been reading poems for 25 years I think I would be driven to throwing things at the computer screen.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>115215</review_data_id><review_date>2015-11-07</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I have taken more than a dozen courses via EdX or Coursers.

I knew that that would be easy, because I knew practically nothing about these subjects. I had been an avid student of English Literature for my entire life, especially focused on 18th Century, but also 17th and 19th Century poetry and prose. I was an avid reader of 20th Century American and English prose, but found little that appealed to me in the abstract arts of expression. My feet were pretty much deeply embedded in the concrete one might say, if one were me, what with my concrete imaging mechanisms firmly rooted, because of all those decades of reading/seeing the world as an infinity of possibilities given my free-ranging/reigning imagination, but unready to concede that I could also rely on the alternate realities of others, those with different visions to guide me forward. So what did I learn? I learned that I could rely on these forms of expression to allow me the freedom to decide to wallow in my comfort zone, or put out a toe into the roiling/sizzling/eddying waters of radical expression. With the Filreis option/blessing of just keeping it out there for as little or as long as I could manage the sensation, without being chastised/chastened. How does one improve on this total freedom to explore oneself through others? I cannot answer that question.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>60828</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-21</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I honestly went in kind of blind. I have a background in instructional design and was chosen to interview for a position, so in preparation for the interviews I decided to review as many UPenn MOOC offerings as possible. ( I was basically looking at as many as I could in a short amount of time to compare and contrast the different approaches by various UPenn professors, as well as to look at a other delivery platforms.) While they ultimately chose another finalist for the opening, I got something better. I fell in love with this course and rediscovered the joy of reading and analyzing poetry. (I dropped the other courses I had been sampling, to focus on this one.) As mentioned, I did have some background in literature, so I expected to maybe learn about some newer poets. However, I was stunned that this was not the typical boring online lecture course (or, even worse, a bunch of pdf files or powerpoints with "GOALS AND OBJECTIVES" listed every 12th screen in repetitious and rather condescending bullet points). It blew all my previous experiences with online learning out of the water. This course challenged me to think every day (and many late-nights, in discussion with people across the globe.) Not only did this course recreate the intimacy and excitement (and fun and humor) of an actual college seminar, it went on to exceed any college seminar I've taken because we had the whole "massive" aspect going on: thousands of participants who were also involved in animated conversations about poetry, challenging, championing, and teaching me in the forums. Most of all, making me smile as we connected. We had dedicated TAs and Volunteer Community TAs asking provocative open questions and generating exciting discussions. We had excellent writing assignments. We had the amazing technical staff that created this particular course's audio/visuals and made the live webcasts possible. We had a Professor and a co-Professor who were entirely engaged, reached out to us, and made us feel relevant. I honestly can't think of anything that could be improved upon. I learned so much more than I ever expected.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>60793</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-21</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course was magnificent!!!

The development of community in all it's richness. Then I am able to say, without hesitation how able and progressive this course was for me. There is a time when your anonymity becomes your strength .

This course has been the most valuable class and the most enjoyable class that I have ever experienced. Professor Filreis and his talented team of TA's have created in this course an amazing online learning environment in which a wonderful community of learners emerges. The course includes poems by Dickinson, Whitman, Pound, Gertrude Stein, Robert Creeley to name just a few.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>3912</review_data_id><review_date>2013-11-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry facilitated by Al Filreis is an outstanding course for novices and professionals, old and young, female and male, national and international, able and disabled, open- and close-minded-- no one is exempt. Besides learning to close read poems, students learn how the poems are related to the poetry of Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman. Assisted by Mr. Filreis, his teaching assistants, and other staff, students learn via lectures, webcasts, discussions, quizzes, essays, and peer-review of essays. What is unlikable about the course is (1) it includes few contributions by African American poets and none by Latinos (except William Carlos Williams) and Native Americans, at least none who are recognized as such and (2) the course is too short.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>3886</review_data_id><review_date>2013-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I had a maybe 1 or 2 college classes that included Modern Poetry in their subject matter. But most of my knowledge has been self-learned. I was definitely among the lower have of students! Part of this is me being older and not as fresh as I used to be. This class was great. I loved it's "panel" format. It offers relief from the problem of looking at the same face, with the same voice, for an entire set of videos. It's also really fun to feel like you are part of the discussion of students/teachers in the video, and offers interesting moments of contention and humor that can't otherwise happen. I was a huge fan of this class.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>3861</review_data_id><review_date>2013-11-15</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This was my second coursera course (and the best of the two) and I am absolutely blown away by the quality of the instruction, materials and participation.

As Al so delightfully and wonderfully says in his course more than once - once you have tasted this, there is simply no going back. I owe Al, the team and the extended community an incredible debt of gratitude. I will likely return to redo this for sheer pleasure next year.

There are no lectures in ModPo. Not one. What you view are discussions with a few students, expertly facilitated by Al Filreis, who trusts "the wisdom in the room" to elucidate key features of each poem. There are live webcast discussions (with "real" poets) that help enrich each week's material. Everything is recorded so you can participate when you have time. The cheerful discussions help you think through a close-reading process. I found it confusing at first, but I grew to absolutely love it. I learned how to really read poetry. You study a few poems a week. The syllabus looks intimidating, with maybe 20 or more items to do each week, until you see that each item is a small task. You can get through the entire course one bite at a time. The quizzes are directly related to the content and designed to help you review the material, not trick you. If you want to get the full Monty and complete the course, you can write four essays. If you keep up with the material, they’re very doable and an effective way of learning and getting feedback. You write—and receive—peer reviews for each round of essays, which are so helpful. You share feedback with your fellow students. You begin to see the rich variety of students taking the course, and you learn from everyone. I spent 5-7 hours on the course each week, and would have loved to have given more time to it. One thing I will do when I repeat this course next year-- apparently lots of ModPo'ers can't get enough of it--is spend more time in the discussion forums. That's where you can express your confusion and enthusiasm, complain and get help, share your insights, and feel a part of the community. You will be surprised how connected you can feel to 40,000 fellow poetry- loving students.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>3831</review_data_id><review_date>2013-11-14</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>My first experience with modern poetry and it was quite an eye-opening experience.

Although an undergraduate survey course, ModPo is one of the most engaging courses I have ever taken. Although it is a MOOC, it is intimate. The professor and TAs unselfishly reveal their personalities, and their passion shows. The curriculum is inspired and inspiring. And for many, the combination of its content and its format may be transformational.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>3526</review_data_id><review_date>2013-12-23</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>ModPo is not only the most satisfying MOOC experience I have had but it is one of the best educational experiences I have ever had as an undergraduate or graduate student. Not only is it evident that many people and much work went into developing this MOOC, but, and this is what blows me away, how much time, attention, energy, and work go into to present the course day by day, week by week. Al, Julia, the TAs, volunteers, support staff, visiting professors and poets, and friends of the Kelly Writers House all go out of their way to make ModPo as close to a real-time, live experience as can be accomplished through digital media. Along with an excellent syllabus, this group has assembled a wealth of resources, available from within the course portal. All the material you need for the class is available through the portal--plus, the student is introduced to so many other resources that live long past the ending of the course. These online sources are maintained, containing decades of material of readings, interviews, audio recordings, videos, and a host of other resources. Along with the Kelly Writers House community, the student also joins an international community of other students, at all levels of proficiency and experience with both poetry and English. This diverse, international community generates ideas, readings, connections, and interactions that truly feed intellect, soul, and self. I signed up for this MOOC because I wanted to add some humanities to my life. As a humanities student many years ago, I fell in love with poetry, languages, philosophy, art, cultural history, fiction and have maintained that passion, but primarily alone. I write training for my career, but in the technology field. I thought I would take this course to get poetry back in my life more deliberately, perhaps brush up on my scansion, read a few poems with other people, and learn more about poetry from the Penn faculty and students. It didn't take too long into the course, say within 15 minutes of the first video discussion, that I knew this was going to be something special. And I was right. It is. Because of the the people who developed it, contribute to it along with their responsibilities at the university, and all the thousands, tens of thousands of poetry lovers who open their hearts, minds, mouths and share their passion, ideas, voices. No lectures here--only conversation, discussion, sharing ideas; exploring the text together, making discoveries about the poem and the self. The course does not tell you what a poem means, but rather shows you how you can find meaning in the poem by close reading. Al Filreis is not only committed to poetry scholarship, but he is committed to people, regardless of their background in poetry and literature, to help develop an understanding and love for poetry. His philosophy of education is so refreshing. His style is to explore a poem with a close reading, which he and his colleagues demonstrate through playful, insightful conversation, where no one is the expert, but each person adds something to the experience. I think this is a large part of what makes ModPo work: it is a community experience where each person is involved in reading a poem, that is, interpreting and applying it. I have taken more than a few MOOCs at this point. Some have been well worth the time; others, well, they weren't a good fit for me. Some I lost interest in because of the way they were presented. With so many things demanding my time, I have to be selective in what I commit to. With ModPo, while I could commit to a few hours a week and satisfy the requirements, I find myself putting in more time, not just on the course site itself but in exploring the resources. This course has reignited my passion for poetry again, giving it more focus and purpose. Amazing that something free and online could make such a strong impact on me-- and, this semester, 35k other people world-wide. I can recommend this MOOC without any reservation. Thank you, Coursera and ModPo, for bringing education to so many people globally.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>3477</review_data_id><review_date>2013-10-20</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course doesn't compare to others. Or rather, other courses can't be compared to THIS. The amazing professor Al Filreis, together with his wonderful TAs, have worked really hard to create a syllabus and audiovisual material that is thorough, enriching, challenging, and absolutely enjoyable at the same time... and then, they have committed to participating actively in the forums and collaborative teaching-learning experience in such a way that when you take ModPo you don't feel you must do this or that, you just feel welcomed and honestly encouraged by this incredible group of people... ModPo is much more than a course. It's a life changing experience.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>3470</review_data_id><review_date>2013-10-20</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is the second year ModPo has been offered. I completed it last year and loved it so much I signed up again. There's still so much to learn about the subject. I have been following poetry for years, reading it most of my life, and I've been lucky enough to participate in some marvellous workshops and classes, but ModPo is something unto itself. Perhaps it's the fact you can interact with people from all over the world in the forums. Perhaps it's the amazing lack of negative remarks that show up all too often in public chat sites. Perhaps it's the friendships forged by a common interest in words and the myriad ways they can be bumped up against one another to form not only ideas and images, but something more than that, something akin to spiritual. But mostly, I think, the success of ModPo is thanks to its incredible head honcho, Professor Al Filreis, whose enthusiasm and humour shines through every conversation he's part of (and he is part of so many I swear he must be cloned). If ModPo is an example of how we'll learn things in the future, we have little to worry about.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>3460</review_data_id><review_date>2013-10-20</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I suppose this course could be done quite nicely in 5-7 hours but it is so interesting and inspiring that you can't help but go on chasing the threads through all the online resources.

The method is very engaging - we follow the discussions of an enthusiastic teacher - Al Filreis - with his group of bright and ever so generous young students. It's lively, unexpected and fun most of the times. Complementing, there's talks with other poets, teachers, and other people who get together to share something they are passionate about. And we feel part of it all the way, the course is WITH us, not just for us. Working in a full time/overtime job and not being able to enrol classic courses to pursue my interests or simply stretch my mind, I'm finding this online course a precious source of knowledge. Although "fast paced", all matters are discussed "substantially" and accurately. And even if I not able to participate in the forums as often as I wished, it's always a joy to sign in and discover and learn and be surprised once again. I am sure that all the texts, references and ideas that are crossing this amazing community will stay with me a long time and provide me chances to dig in deeper in poets and poetry. I will be forever grateful to the amazing team and all the classmates of ModPo. The sessions for week 6 have just been uploaded, I'm rushing now, only time to add that I'm from Lisbon, Portugal, and English not being my first language, I'm having no trouble following the texts or the videos - so don't let language or distance deter you!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>3454</review_data_id><review_date>2013-10-20</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>An incredibly well-organised and inspiring course.

The course was recommended to me by someone who has completed several MOOCs and who told me it was life-changing. I agree and I cannot praise it enough.

Professor Filreis is utterly brilliant, conveying a passion for poetry that I've rarely seen emulated elsewhere. His teaching style is as far from didactic as it could be - which, I think, is where this course bests all the others I've taken. All hail Socrates and Al Filreis. The community are also absolutely brilliant, always helpful, inspiring and pushing you further than you ever thought possible. What's being done on ModPo is both special and important.

But this course is a lifetime experience that i could not possibly compare to any other courses, relevant or non- relevant to the subject of Modern Poetry. First of all I would like to praise the effort of the professor Al Filreis, who is an inspiration to all of the students and in particular to me. He has the qualities of a great teacher. He is organising the class and the themes in such a way, that a student can not miss anything of the videos, the assignements, the quizzes. He is so passionate about Poetry that he transfuses all this passion and love to me. He is always present, ready to answer all questions, comment on our posts. He is the kind of teacher that rather than offering a one man show, he shows the way to his students, makes one think and go into a deeper analysis of all subjects. Although some of us are far away from other countries he constantly makes us feel as if we belong to a class, to the community of ModPo. All his students and partners are excellent, taking part in our forums. Taking part in this class is a life-changing experience, learning so much, going far beyond in thought and reading.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>3414</review_data_id><review_date>2013-10-20</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Amazing course.

The videos give you an authentic experience of a tutorial-style of teaching, and the links and audio material add an extra dimension.

It is that flexible. The requirements for certification are straight forward but have rigour, a beautiful community gathers around the fabulous teaching style of Professor Fireis. Rather than being told what to think, we are encouraged to say what we see- therefore I feel equipped to continue in poetry after the course. It is challenging- some of the material we study is on the edge, but the edge enriches the centre and holds it together. Highly recommended</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>3411</review_data_id><review_date>2013-10-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is by far the best course I have ever taken, virtual or otherwise. It has made the world of modern poetry come alive in away that I could not have possibly imagined . Prof. Al Filreis is quite simply a brilliant, passionate, funny, and thought provoking teacher who ignites a spark, or rather a veritable firestorm of critical thinking in his students. Amazingly through the crowd sourcing effect of the Forum discussions this effect is multiplied a thousand fold. In that sense even though the aim of the course is to whet the appetite for Modern poetry the resources and trajectories generated by its form are quite literally limitless. I would also like to give a shout out to the super helpful TA's and PennSound which is an amazing poetry resource and one which will continue to delight and intrigue me for a very long time.

I also read for the Found Poetry Review and do some free-lance editing, both for poetry anthologies and for post-secondary school students, on an ad-hoc basis). I've done distance education via the Internet off and on for years but anything I've taken before comes nowhere close to this course as far as how wonderfully presented it is, how enthusiastic both the professor and the TA's are, how much I'm learning...just everything about it is very top-drawer and while I'm sure I could do the work in the suggested 5-7 hours, I find myself willingly putting in more time (hence the 8-11 cited above) as I enjoy doing as much reading as there is available, and more if I can ferret out other sites. I haven't taken another MOOC so can't compare this one to any others as yet but expect this will be a hard act to follow. Professor Filreis seems to have an uncommon knack of remembering every student that calls in (a really personal touch for the live webcasts that are just that, personal) or that asks questions in the forums. We all joke that he seems to never sleep, but he keeps irregular hours so he's accessible to people all over the world at various times and has made learning such an open experience, I can't praise his influence highly enough. And, I don't think he sleeps much, no joke. The only thing I've found to dislike about the course is that some people have been posting comments under an "anonymous" name,in the forums, and often the comments have been slightly quarrelsome or complaining, sometimes on the verge of offensive. However, one such person mentioned recently that it might be hazardous to post under their name where they are, and it occurred to me that not everywhere in the world do students have the same luxury or freedom as some of the rest of us, to state their opinions freely on any site or topic, so I've decided to back off on this petty complaint now. However, you wondered what I might dislike about the course, so I'm telling you. It seems picayune when measured against so much that's positive. If I haven't made it clear by now, I absolutely think this is one of the best things I've ever done for myself and I understand many students take it more than once; I can see myself being one of those. It's that good.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>3407</review_data_id><review_date>2013-10-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I had no prior experience with poetry.

For me, relatively new to modern poetry, I can feel my brain stretching........</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>2719</review_data_id><review_date>2013-07-09</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Excellent introduction to poetic scene and background of the different epochs of America that deals progressively with the style and form and eventually metapoetic transformation.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>2512</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>ModPo helped me gain a greater understanding and appreciation of poetry and the positive role that it can play in my life. The course does not require a lot of time but I found myself spending many enjoyable hours just participating in the discussion fora. The course is unlike any other Coursera course I have taken, both in its format (the videos are a roundtable on a particular poem) and content. It is sui generis -- for that alone you shouldn't miss it. I didn't like the format at first but it grew on me as it will on you. If you love poetry, take this course. If you are baffled by poetry, take this course. If you want your life enriched, take this course. I am a retiree. I graduated Penn long before Al Filreis was teaching there -- my loss then but I am making up for it now through this excellent medium.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>1756</review_data_id><review_date>2013-05-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Great course! I love literature, but didn't have a lot of exposure to the American poetry before (excluding Emily Dickinson and a couple of other names). I learned many new names and had an opportunity to get a bit of insight into the historical context behind their work. The relaxed way in which the course was taught (the professor was discussing the course subjects with his students, which is more engaging than a monologue, especially with a topic like poetry), the challenging (in a good way) topics for the essays and the friendly community of the co-learners, all combined, made it a good experience. Also, I might be taking this course for another time after a while, especially if there will be some new names in the syllabus.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>975</review_data_id><review_date>2013-02-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I really enjoyed this course. The poetry selections were great and some were poems I have never read or writers I never heard of. The video lecture helped in the sense that they taught me how think about the poems. After that I felt I could write something on the Discussion Forums which I found to be a wonderful experience. I have never done anything like that before and really enjoy the discussion and try go out of my comfort zone and participate. I found the course so good that I signed up for the course again. It would be nice to see a list of suggested reading before the course so you can keep up with readings and read more background information on the poets.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>972</review_data_id><review_date>2013-02-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>In two words or less: "Great Course."

The format used is ideal for poetry discussion and evaluation -- readings, audio files, and video discussions by a group of TAs led by their erudite and non-judgemental professor Al Filreis. The essays allowed participants to truly examine the poems and share ideas with each other, further enhanced by peer evaluations. The discussion fora were amazing --- the online interaction with other students (as well as the TAs, and even Professor Al) were an integral part of the entire course. It would be hard to improve an already excellent course. (Although, on occasion it was difficult to find/reexamine specific topics in the discussion fora, and some duplication of discussion ensued.) This was my first MOOC and it has whetted my appetite for others.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>970</review_data_id><review_date>2013-02-24</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The ModPo community is a vibrant one -- engagement is definitely a plus point for this course.

After the first week, however, that all changed: the course was taught in a style that draws people from all backgrounds into the global discussion of modern poetry. I was hooked, and ended up looking forward to the new videos each week and (joyfully) spending hours perfecting my essays. The professor, Al Filreis, is very engaged and helps to make the class into an intellectual community. Overall, ModPo has been one of my favorite MOOCs - definitely give it a try!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>643</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-13</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>I enjoy this course but the important question is, so what?

He has obviously taught this before and it shows in the organization of it and in the poems selected. The syllabus is fantastic. This course introduced me to many new poems, poets and styles of poetry. The seminar style is lively and keeps it real. The teaching assistants are brilliant and frequently have insightful things to say. As a humanities course the closest comparison is with Science Fiction and Fantasy. I took that course and while the readings were valuable, the ModPo 'video of a seminar' format is much more interesting. In terms of creating an interactive and personal vibe, the closest comparison would be with the original Artificial Intelligence course taught by Dr Thrun. But again ModPo does it even better by having multiple personalities available to keep things interesting. The forums were amazingly active and attracted several contemporary poets who were on the syllabus to participate. In addition there were connections to other active poetry websites with valuable resources This course has changed my life in that I have just purchased two volumes of the collected poems of John Ashbery. I think many other students are similarly stimulated and are still active in the course forums and in Facebook groups and other online venues weeks after the course has ended. You cannot ask for a better introduction to Modern and Contemporary American Poetry.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>553</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-06</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>What I loved about college literature classes was the intimate discussion of books: we'd sit around a seminar table and closely analyze texts. I didn't know how that could be replicated online. But Al Fireis and his brilliant band of teaching assistants managed to create an engaging, intimate experience in their pre-recorded discussions at the Kelly Writers House. I felt like I was in the room with them. I learned so much this semester. It was by far the best literature class I've ever taken. I was challenged in the best possible way. This was a life-changing experience. I had read quite a bit of poetry before taking the class, but I hadn't studied much poetry formally in an academic setting. I don't think the class needs prerequisites: I think Al has done a remarkable job of challenging people who are already familiar with the poems on the syllabus, yet not alienating those who are new to reading poetry. Great course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>538</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-03</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Al is putting poetry and the internet together to mold MOOCs into technology that is disruptive to lecture based education.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>536</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-03</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry, or ModPo as it is affectionately called by thousands of us who took the course, was a revelation.

This course is work, yet the pay off for the time you put into the readings, the videos and participating in the forums is ten-fold.

This course is beautifully designed and well executed by Prof Filreis and his capable TA's. I have learned so much, far beyond my expectations, about poetry that I am committed to continue study, and to stay involved with the ModPo community for the next twelve months. Prof. Al's pedagogy is wonderful. He is a marvelous facilatator of student learning, eschews the lecture method of teaching, and encourages students to learn from each other and from sources presented by him in the core syllabus. What a wild ride this was! I will certainly continue studies in poetry and in other subjects as well through MOOC's - education for everyone. It is wonderful!!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>481</review_data_id><review_date>2012-11-30</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I was very impressed and was sorry to see this course end.

The syllabus was very comprehensive, covering major poets and movements in 20th century America. The assignments and quizzes were all interesting and thought-provoking. Professor Al Filreis is a highly gifted and wonderful teacher who knows his subject inside and out. He engaged his TAs in a series of fascinating close readings of poems using a round table format for the videos, which was such an inspired technique. I felt really absorbed in these conversations and learnt a great deal from them. It was great to see Al and the TAs everywhere in the discussion forums, posing and answering questions, and encouraging us all. There was an enthusiastic community spirit amongst students, which added greatly to the enjoyment of the course. I have some poetry background from my university days, but it's not a prerequisite to taking this course. It's easy to find resources online to brush up on poetic lingo and do a little reading on the American social and economic situations that influenced these poets. I recommend this course to anyone with an interest in poetry and language. Thank you Al, Ally, Amaris, Anna, Dave, Emily, Kirsten, Max and Molly, and everyone else behind the scenes, for a hugely enjoyable experience. I'm now seeing poetry everywhere! :)</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>392</review_data_id><review_date>2012-11-15</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This was hands-down one of the best courses that I've ever taken. The instructor and the TAs were super-human in their ability to create content, monitor the forums, respond to questions and criticism, and stay connected with the students. I had no poetry background but the staff seemed to anticipate this and did not talk over me and always made me feel that the Ah- ha moment was imminent - and indeed it has been. This course has much more of a feeling of community that one might expect from an on-line class and that is fostered by Al and the TAs. I would highly recommend the course to anyone who is interested in liberal arts.

By the way a special thanks to those who are providing for the technical requirements, which have worked out very well. I especially appreciated the American way of teaching: humorous, patient and nevertheless on a very high academic standard. It broadened my mind, I made the acquaintance of numerous poets I hadn't read before and I was introduced to a broad range of poetic and also other movements. And it encouraged in a unique way to improve my own writing and use of language. Also because of the great number of dedicated students and perhaps due to the topic itself I felt quickly as part of a worldwide community. It has been an excellent course I warmly recommend.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>389</review_data_id><review_date>2012-11-14</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Dear Al, and all the Knights of the Round Table-- (too flowery?). Simply mean that the close reading and "Via translating" you do is like a quest. Al says bring me back the golden-dirty fleece and you do! Your love of the process, the demandingness, and the ferment of 20th century poetry is infectious and always stimulating. I learned so much--much more than was explicitly taught! Thank you for your heroic hard work and wonderful minds. You are truly full of Eunoia and we felt it. This is just to say: (And stealing a paraphrase to say it) The thing that I'll remember 20 years from now, is that you showed, lived and taught us that even in this fatigued and battered world, art (language) can still express an uncanny and sublime thought. You lived it, showed it, proved it. Kelly House is a type of hidden, historical Paris/Venice/ Village. Will really miss the weekly meetings. Thanks. Will spread the word. *********** (To answer the rest--this is my first on-line course. The website is incredibly supportive and user friendly. Even challenging content was very successfully conveyed--but I expected to not track everything because of my lack of poetry background. Perhaps a survey course in 2oth century history in Europe and America would give a little more context for the artistic movements underway and be a good preparation. Also, having some students of color at the table would be good.)</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>387</review_data_id><review_date>2012-11-14</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This was the most outstanding course I have ever taken, college or otherwise, and barring the fact that it was online.

However, this course exceeded what I thought I was going to learn as I became a more enthusiastic student. English is not my mother tongue and this massive online course has helped me to develop my level of English. The experience I gained is way beyond what I truly expected. ModPo managed to gather thousands of people with the same love and passion for poetry, this is priceless. Professor Al is my mentor, he is a great teacher and I really appreciate the fact that he has been always there to help and respond to our doubts.

I enjoyed the writting assignments and the peer reviews, I learned a lot from both processes, with a bit of tweaking for clarity you'll have a home run!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>236</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-28</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I am not sure I can do justice to a review of this course, but I must try. ModPo is a complete immersion in poetry and poetics, working through the history of American poetry from Dickinson and Whitman up to today's writers. Amazing to do that in 10 short weeks. The personal attention and dedication of Al Filreis and his teaching assistants is wonderful, and hard to do with such a huge enrollment. Yet we each feel as though they know our names and offer such encouragement. The community of ModPo students on the discussion forums and on FB feel like close friends and colleagues, although spread over the globe. In fact, I was so enthused about this course that I signed up for three more. I recommend the course every chance I get. And bravo to Al and his group for a great great experience.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>26</course_id><course_title>Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>235</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-28</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course has exceeded my expectations. Not in terms of the content because I have some experience with poetry, but in terms of the distance education component. I've taken a couple of courses this way and the video presentations and the discussions between Al and his TAs are superlative to anything I have taken. It's such a pleasure to watch and listen to the discussions that it hardly feels like work. Don't get me wrong, the assignments and the interpretations are challenging but if you keep up, these things are manageable. The deeper understanding of the poems and my confidence in my own interpretations and writing about poetry are just some of the rewards. I strongly encourage anyone interested in poetry of any type to try this course! There is so much to gain and nothing to lose. Thanks Al and all the TAs for the passion, enthusiasm, and the intelligence in the discussions.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>426</course_id><course_title>Comic Books and Graphic Novels</course_title><school>School:  University of Colorado Boulder</school><review_data_id>3908</review_data_id><review_date>2013-11-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course, quite simply, was excellent. The subject matter and academic approach was demanding, fascinating and its delivery outstanding. The course content was deep and rich, and was presented in a thoroughly approachable, enthusiastic and accessible manner. Professor Kuskin is a superb educator: inspiring, challenging and motivational. The inclusion of the comic book project was an inspired choice, providing a practical application to the theoretical components that were taught. What better way to actually learn? The course has changed me. Not only in the way I perceive the subject matter, but in the way I see popular culture as a whole. It has changed my approach to my own work and my approach as an educator. I cannot recommend the course highly enough. Thank you to everyone involved, and especially Professor Kuskin.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>426</course_id><course_title>Comic Books and Graphic Novels</course_title><school>School:  University of Colorado Boulder</school><review_data_id>3859</review_data_id><review_date>2013-11-15</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Very inspiring and educative course by Prof. William Kuskin!

The lectures analyzed in depth crucial moments in comic book history, always with an attentive and critical eye in reading the pages of comics masters. Writing the essays I was able to train my own critical understanding of a comic book page, while also improving my English writing skills. The comic book project has really pushed me to explore my creative capabilities in crafting a story and expressing it not only in words but also visually. I never thought I had it in me: I wish to recommend this course not only to those comic book lovers who want to understand comics more deeply, but also to readers in general. This course will teach you a lot about comics, literature, creativity and art.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>426</course_id><course_title>Comic Books and Graphic Novels</course_title><school>School:  University of Colorado Boulder</school><review_data_id>3927</review_data_id><review_date>2013-11-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I took the course because I am a high school English teacher who found myself teaching a course in graphic novels for the first time this year. Although I am a comic book reader, I felt it would be good to take the course. My original intent was to watch the lectures and do what ever work my time would allow. I really did not think I would be able to complete the second paper or the comic, possibly one but not the other at best, but I found myself getting so excited about the course that I completed all of the work. The lectures were very informative, and I watched several of them twice. This course is a definite keeper.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>426</course_id><course_title>Comic Books and Graphic Novels</course_title><school>School:  University of Colorado Boulder</school><review_data_id>3905</review_data_id><review_date>2013-11-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I'd only taken MOOCs which involved exams before, and any that involved more serious interaction like writing and uploading my own songs or recording improvs just proved too time consuming and I dropped out - but such was the communal feeling on the discussion groups and the support - that despite 3 weeks away from the course, I still managed to cram in the work at the end before the deadlines! It's fascinating and wide ranging - going from exams on the history of american comics to writing in depth analysis on a single page of a comic book, to writing and illustrating your own comic. It's pretty demanding at times (especially the final weekend in cramming for the last exam and making a 6 page comic with colour cover!) but like anything = the more effort you put in, the more reward you get out. Best MOOC I've ever done by far.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>426</course_id><course_title>Comic Books and Graphic Novels</course_title><school>School:  University of Colorado Boulder</school><review_data_id>3862</review_data_id><review_date>2013-11-15</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I can't say enough good things about this course.

Professor Kuskin's obvious passion for the subject matter was positively infectious and I couldn't help being inspired. His approach and deep knowledge kept me tuned in interested the entire time. And his "Team Zero" support staff couldn't have been any more responsive and great. I HIGHLY recommend this course.

I took this course to rekindle my interest in this medium both as a consumer and potential creator. As someone with only an average knowledge of the subject I found that the information provided expanded upon this and took my interest to the next level. The Professors well presented video lectures show a deep passion and understanding of the subject whilst providing easily accessible information to both the novice and the most experienced enthusiast. To fully benefit from the course and complete the assignments I would recommend putting in the hours, especially for the comic book assignment. It does say that it is 3-4 hours per week but if you consider additional study, assignments and subsequent peer evaluations you need to at least double that. You have to put the work in to appreciate this course but it is an experience well worth undertaking. That is not to say you can't take the course if you only have the minimum hours available it is still worth starting. I would certainly consider taking any other course provided by Professor Kuskin and TEAM ZERO plus will most certainly be keeping an eye out for any follow on courses.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>426</course_id><course_title>Comic Books and Graphic Novels</course_title><school>School:  University of Colorado Boulder</school><review_data_id>3992</review_data_id><review_date>2013-11-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I had no prior experience with comics, except indulging in some readings of Mickey Mouse or Rahan when I was a child. Now, I am working in the field of digital comics, so I was very much interested in being very strong on what I though to be the basics. I found myself in the middle of a very interesting course, far beyond what I imagined, and while it didn't touch some topics of my interest (digital comics, alternate genres - BD and manga, research approaches involving comics) or barely scratched the surface of some other (comics economics, the structure of comics), I've definitely learned a lot and I feel that a new universe has opened in front of me.

I have been interested in Comic Books since I was a young girl, and I have a background (BA and MA) in English, so I thought this course would make for a good experience. It was great in ways I didn't imagine, and it was frustrating in ways I didn't anticipate, but overall -- I think it was a wonderful experience. Prof Kuskin made the material come alive for us, his enthusiasm is infectious, and I thought the assignments were thoughtful and well considered for our massive student body of learners. What I was frustrated by -- all the ways this course was NOT like a traditional course -- I had to write my papers for peer reviewers, some of whom didn't speak English as a first language, and some of whom don't share my background in literature. However, by the end, I have come around to seeing that this is a new way of learning and I shouldn't foist my preconceived notions of learning on this new process. We all have Google, we can all look up any historical date or figure, or allow it to do math for us, etc. What will matter in the future is our ability to break complex problems into critical details, synthesize information so as to come up with new solutions, etc. And THAT is precisely what a MOOC offers -- you get help more from colleagues than the instructor -- and the result is not so much that you get an "A" or score points -- but that you truly learn something. That's a hard thing for me to forego -- I have spent 40 years figuring out how to get an A -- but when I let go of that -- I saw the power of the MOOC in a really clear way. And I liked it very much. Prof Kuskin made this a terrific experience, and I'm sorta sad it's over, honestly. I'm already exploring other MOOCs now.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>426</course_id><course_title>Comic Books and Graphic Novels</course_title><school>School:  University of Colorado Boulder</school><review_data_id>111184</review_data_id><review_date>2015-08-08</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I thought the course content was excellent, the videos clearly presented by well informed tutors.

The comic book project is a labor, but it really forces you to apply course learning to a product. This aspect of the class has helped me to reconnect with my own students and rethink some of the crazy projects I come up with for them. Nothing like a role reversal to do that for you.

I liked that this course gives an important background on the development as well as recent history of comics (mostly in the United States, but also in Europe), and it focuses in how every page is vital to the process of reading and staying interested in the story. I learned a lot about the pacing of a story, using both visual and textual elements, by analysing (in the assignments), listening (to the video lectures) and reading the thoughts of others (in comics, assignments, and the discussion forums).

This course was fun and enjoyable to take, there was a great community interaction on the boards and a lot of support, both technical and otherwise, provided in a very prompt manner. Compared to other courses I have taken I would say the course load was at times heavier, but not harder. If it was ever offered as a longer, even more in-depth course, I would be the first to sign up. The assignments definitely were a challenge, which was part of the fun. I think the videos were well done and the instructor's (Prof. Kuskin) narrative style made them all the more fun to watch.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>426</course_id><course_title>Comic Books and Graphic Novels</course_title><school>School:  University of Colorado Boulder</school><review_data_id>3917</review_data_id><review_date>2013-11-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I had no prior experience of the subject.

After completing this course, I have a whole new appreciation for Graphic Novels, Comics and Art. I am looking forward to buying my next graphic novel and interpreting it with my new learnings from Prof Kuskin and his team. The course design was perfect for me. I am currently deployed in South Lebanon with the UN and do not have a lot of spare time, materiels or good internet connections, but all of this did not matter, because the course was laid out in such a way that making up time was not an issue. There was plenty of scope to miss a lecture (or 5) in a week and blitz them to catch up. As for the comic project.... WOW, what an eye-opener. So much work goes into a comic/graphic novel and I now have a whole new appreciation for the authors, artists, inkers and colourers work. In all, I;d like to thank Prof Kuskin and his team for a very enjoyable course and for really opening my eyes to the world of graphic novels and comics!! As he'd say himself...

Prof. Kuskin is a dynamic and engaging speaker. I purchased several of the non-required books referenced in the course. I found that Kuskin introduces his own interesting perspective on the the topic, not just taking ideas directly from other sources.

I never once considered giving-up. I was learning, interacting with others (mainly on the FB group) and generally enjoying the workload. I think that some of the videos and presentations were a little on the long side but it is difficult to say what could be edited out.

I learned a lot about them, and Kuskin was a very energetic and dynamic speaker. I think this class would have benefited by using some of the panel format that Al Filreis' Modern Poetry class used. It's really fun to see multiple faces on the screen discussing a poem, and I think it would work even better for comics. The assignment of creating your own comic book was fun, and gave me a new respect for how much time/effort go into comics. I would definitely take another Kuskin class in the future.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>426</course_id><course_title>Comic Books and Graphic Novels</course_title><school>School:  University of Colorado Boulder</school><review_data_id>3885</review_data_id><review_date>2013-11-16</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>My first time in comic-related class and it was fun doing historical literature review.

The material covered is extensive, and provides information about developing a literary approach to comics as well as a history of comics. There's also some interesting insights into the comic book community, too. Professor Kuskin is engaging and clearly loves his subject, which is a joy for anyone who has ever sat through a lecture from a bored, disinterested academic who wants to be anywhere but the lecture hall. He brings the comics to life and provides valuable insights into why comics are more than just superhero stories for nerds. The workload isn't light; it is a rigorous course with two essays and two lecture tests, and a draw-your-own- comic task towards the end. They are all worth completing, but be aware that this isn't a course that will require minimal effort. It's a great course that will give you a good mental workout. Thoroughly recommended.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>426</course_id><course_title>Comic Books and Graphic Novels</course_title><school>School:  University of Colorado Boulder</school><review_data_id>3881</review_data_id><review_date>2013-11-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Comic Books and Graphic Novels was a far more challenging and rewarding course than I expected.

The subject is very interesting, the lectures are very clear and it looks like the teacher is really enjoying teaching. I found that 3 hours of intense , packed lectures was too much... you need to repeat them to absorb everything . Although I felt that StandardML language is exciting, it was a bit too much for me coupled with quite hard homework. I was familiar with functional concepts and played with Lisp,Prolog and Clojure before, but still too many hours to dedicate for a full time working person. If you have 15-20+ hours to dedicate to this course, go ahead and take you will learn a lot. In two weeks that I took this course I learned more than I learned reading all these clojure/functional programming blog posts... I would say 2 hours lectures , meaning reducing 30% of the material will be perfect.

Programming Languages is a course intended to teach many important principles in programming with a strong emphasis in functional programming. Among the most interesting concepts are the contrasts between static and dynamic typing (and type inference), and the contrasts between functional programming and object-oriented programming. But The course covers other fundamental concepts like mutability / immutability, algebraic data types and pattern matching, recursion and tail recursion, first-class functions and closures, high-order programming, currying, modules, parametric polymorphism, thunks and lazy evaluation, streams, memoization, macros, object-oriented inheritance, mixins, and many other interesting topics. Every week a set of topics is covered in great detail in a series of videos that may have a length between 10 to 20 minutes. The material is released every week as course progresses. The materials covered in the videos are also provided in written format for further analysis and easier reviewing. Every week a homework is made available to the students. The homework consists of a series of exercises of increasing difficulty. Sometimes the homework contains challenge exercises that can be solved for some extra points. In my case, solving every homework took an average time between 4 to 8 hours, and the challenge exercises sometimes took me almost a similar amount time (mostly due to the lack of specification and not necessarily due to their complexity, although they were more complex than the rest of the exercises in the homework). Students submit their homework and an automatic grading system reviews it by applying a series of tests. The failing tests are reported to the students so that they can fix the problems and resubmit again. Only the first two submissions count for the final grade (an average is used for final grading purposes), although students are allowed to submit as many times as they want. The grading system works pretty well, but there were occasional problems with it that were timely corrected. Perhaps my biggest complaint is that the autograder, many times, does not provided enough information to determine what was wrong with the homework submission and this lead to certain amount of frustration when trying to figure out what to do to solve the problems, above all because only the first two submissions count for the final grade. Particularly for the cases of challenge exercises the information provided by the autograder upon failure of any tests was really scarce. Also, students are required to submit their homework for peer- reviews. And they are required to peer-review other students' homeworks. This exercise is intended to give a broader perspective to the students by means of reading someone else's code. This way, the student can find better solutions created by others or spot problems in their own solutions, etc. Also, during the peer-review process the right/best solutions for the exercises were shared with all students participating in the reviews. Therefore, doing the reviews was the best way to find out the answers to all exercises in the homework. On week 4 and week 8 the students take an online exam consisting in questions with multiple selection answers. The questions are based on the topics covered in previous weeks. Some of the questions could be based on understanding of the theoretical concepts, and some question consist in practical applications of those concepts. Once the student starts the exam there is a time limit to complete it. I think something around 90 minutes. The following is detailed outline of the topics covered every week. Week 1: SML ML Expressions and Variable Bindings Variables are Immutable Function Bindings Pairs and Other Tuples Lists Let Expressions Options Some Other Expressions and Operators Lack of Mutation and Benefits Thereof The Pieces of a Programming Language The homework consisted in the development of series of functions to deal with dates. Week 2: SML Conceptual Ways to Build New Types Records By Name vs By Position, Syntactic Sugar and the Truth about Tuples Datatype Bindings How ML Does Not Provide Access to Data Type Values How ML Provides Access to Datatype Values: Case Expressions Type Synonyms Lists and Options Are Datatypes Polymorphic Datatypes Pattern Matching Type Inference Polymorphic Types and Equality Types Nested Patterns Exceptions Tail Recursion and Accumulators The homework consisted in a series of exercises related to a card game, a variation of solitaire. Week 3: SML Functions as Arguments Polymorphic Types and Functions as Arguments Anonymous Functions Unnecessary Function Wrapping Maps and Filters Returning Functions Lexical Scope Environments and Closures Fold Combining Functions Currying and Partial Application The Value Restriction Mutation via ML References Callbacks Abstract Datatypes Closures in Other Languages The homework consisted in a series of exercises related to the implementation of pattern matching and type inference. Week 4: SML What is Type Inference Overview of ML Type Inference Mutual Recursion Modules for Namespace Management Signatures Hiding Things Equivalent Implementations Benefits of Side-Effect-Free Programming Standard Equivalences There was not homework because this week was the week of the midterm exam. Week 5: Racket Racket vs Scheme Functions, Lists Syntax and Parentheses Dynamic Typing Local Bindings Top-Level Definitions Mutability/Immutability Delayed Evaluation with Thunks Lazy Evaluation Streams Memoization Macros The homework consisted in the implementation of exercises related to streams and the challenge was about defining macros. Week 6: Racket Datatype Programming without Datatypes Recursive Datatypes via Racket Lists Recursive Datatypes via Racket's struc Implementing Programming Languages Interpreters and Compilers Implementing Closures Defining Macros via Functions in the Metalanguage ML versus Racket What Is Static Checking? Correctness, Soundness, Completeness, Undecidability Weak Typing Advantages and Disadvantages of Static Checking The homework consisted in the implementation of an interpreter for small programming language called MUPL (Made Up Programming Language). Week 7: Ruby Objects, Classes, Methods, Variables Visibility and Getters/Setters Everything is an Object Duck Typing Arrays Blocks Hashes and Ranges Subclassing and Inheritance Overriding and Dynamic Dispatch Method Lookup Definition Dynamic Dispatch versus Closures The homework consisted in the implementation of a tetris game. Week 8: Ruby OOP Versus Functional Decomposition Multimethods Mutiple Inheritance Mixins Abstract Methods The Subtyping Relation Function Subtyping Subtyping for OOP Covariance Generics Versus Subtyping Bounded Polymorphism The homework consisted in the implementation of an interpreter for a small language of two-dimensional geometric objects. Final Thoughts In my opinion this is one of the best courses I have ever taken. It was fascinating, the topics were covered in great detail. The professor Grossman explained every topic with plenty of examples and almost all the homework was really interesting and the problems were increasingly challenging. Having the opportunity to work with different programming languages of different paradigms and typing styles really enriched my understanding of how programming languages work, and how to make proper comparisons between their features. It was particularly interesting the effort of converting some implementations of solutions to some problems from functional code to object- oriented code. I think that the course prepares the students to learn and assimilate other programming languages more rapidly by having covered concepts that are typically seen in other languages just with different syntax. From the entire course I found the sections covering Ruby a little bit more uninteresting, and particularly the homework for the tetris game in week 7 was too simple and I found little could be learn from solving the exercise, but the rest of the material and homework were incredibly well thought and prepared. The entire experience was really enriching and I feel that it has made me a better developer and has broadened my understand of programming languages and has rekindled my enthusiasm to learn even more about programming and other programming languages. It is definitely a course that I would highly recommend to any other developers.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>104</course_id><course_title>Programming Languages</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>1095</review_data_id><review_date>2013-03-06</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Programming Language is a tough class, but it has a high payoff. Of all the typical undergraduate CS classes, this is one that, if taught well, should be among the most valuable one takes. However, it's important to understand the purpose of such a class. The purpose is NOT to learn new languages, it is to learn the language paradigms. That is to say, the purpose of PL is not to learn Java or Ruby or Python. It is to gain a deeper understanding of concepts like functional programming, object oriented programming, logic programming, etc... You should learn concepts like call by value and call by name. You should learn lexical a dynamic scoping, etc... There are two ways to learn these concepts. You can use languages that are representative of the techniques and gain a shallow understanding of the concepts, or you can investigate more deeply by implementing these concepts. This class is about 75% the former and 25% the latter, which is a little on the tough side for an online class, but it's quite doable and well worth the time. As great as this class is, I should also be honest about some of the negatives: * logic programming was completely missing, which is a huge failure for a programming languages class * many of the assignments are not well specified, and sometimes the challenge of figuring out what the problem is asking is greater than the challenge of completing the assignment * programming assignments varied wildly in their difficulty level. one assignment may take 8-10 hours of work while the next one can be completed in less than one</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>104</course_id><course_title>Programming Languages</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>1229</review_data_id><review_date>2013-03-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Outstanding pedagogy. Challenging course. Fast pace. The student must apply concepts from simple examples to challenging assignments with little assistance. Heavy workload. About 3 hours of video and 10-12 homework problems per section. There is no doubt that I am a better programmer for having taken this course. The course is not about learning particular languages. The languages covered were carefully chosen to illustrate particular concepts. You will find you can apply this knowledge to the language you usually use (as well as any new language you want to learn).</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>104</course_id><course_title>Programming Languages</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>1257</review_data_id><review_date>2013-04-01</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>First of all, it should be stated that is a real deal programming course. Many courses on coursera do not require that much time commitment, and are definitely laid back versions of college courses. This class however, is tough, and requires a lot of time. It is definitely NOT an introductory programming course. Each weeks contains approximately 3 hours of lectures, and expect to spend 10+ hours doing each homework assignment. If you have the time available, and the will to get through the difficult material, this course is fantastic. Dr. Grossman has put together a great course on some fundamental concepts of programming, and you will be a better programmer after completing it. I will definitely be signing up for this again the next time it is offered, because I was not able to complete everything, as I couldn't devote as much time to the course as I would have liked.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>104</course_id><course_title>Programming Languages</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>1244</review_data_id><review_date>2013-03-30</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>IMHO, this course, along with Tim Roughgarden's Coursera algorithms courses, are the flagship standard bearers as to the value that a brilliant, and more importantly enthusiastic, professor can provide.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>104</course_id><course_title>Programming Languages</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>1202</review_data_id><review_date>2013-03-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>A great course focusing on properties of programming languages with examples taken from SML, Racket, and Ruby. It will be hard if you're very new to programming, but fun and challenging for intermediate programmers and beyond. Professor Grossman's lectures were engaging, and the lectures were also available for download in PDF format, which was very helpful. What I liked best about the course were the exercises. They were clearly very carefully designed to teach you the concepts, challenging but not overwhelming. This is my favorite MOOC along with Norvig's Design of Computer Programs at Udacity. Highly recommended. It will make you a better programmer.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>104</course_id><course_title>Programming Languages</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>1191</review_data_id><review_date>2013-03-24</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Without the long hard climb to the summit the breath taking clarity of the view would have lost considerable impact. To conclude the course with the observation that when discussing functional and Object Oriented programming we are talking about rows and columns - two opposite ways to do the same thing. To finish the course with this insight was a stroke of genius and gave meaning and purpose to all the hard work and learning involved in the class. First rate.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>104</course_id><course_title>Programming Languages</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>1094</review_data_id><review_date>2013-03-06</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Dan Grossman is a great teacher and this is a great course. If you are focused on learning "how to program" in some commercially popular language or other, this course is probably not for you. The course is about how languages work, not how to do use computer languages to do things. In the course, Dr. Grossman introduces us to programming in three different languages - Standard ML, Racket and Ruby. Of the three, the only one of any appreciable commercial interest is Ruby. The work is challenging. If you are a programmer, this course will make you a better one. If you are not a programmer, this course will give you very deep insight into the art. In either case, however, don't expect to be able to apply what you learn in this course directly to your practice. The course could be taken before Martin Odersky's Functional Programming in Scala course. Both courses heavily emphasize functional programming, which was an unfamiliar programming paradigm to me. It didn't come easily - I had to struggle with it. If you have not been exposed to functional programming before, be prepared to work hard and to learn a lot.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>104</course_id><course_title>Programming Languages</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>4152</review_data_id><review_date>2013-12-07</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I've been a software developer for over a decade. I learned LISP in college and reviewed functional programming in a previous Coursera course. If you haven't taken any class that covers functional programming, do so before taking this class. This is not an introductory class. It uses SML, Racket and Ruby to teach concepts of different programming languages. There were 8 weeks of lectures. The lectures were well designed in bite size pieces. The instructor also provided a summary PDF each week to review the materials outside of video form. There were 7 homework assignment - 3 SML, 2 Racket and 2 Ruby. The autograder was intended to be run twice and your score was an average of those two runs. I liked this as it gave incentive to be thorough while still giving useful feedback from the grader. Each assignment came with some test cases . Racket used XUnit. SML and Ruby did not although I ported the tests to do so myself. You could submit more than 2 times if you wanted to (with a lower grade) although there was no need to. Each week there were also challenge problems to learn more. The peer review was guided by very specific things to look for an a sample answer solution. There were also two exams to look at concepts that weren't covered by coding. Dr. Grossman is quite passionate about the material. He and his TAs clearly spent a lot of time making the class fit the style of online education. Since this was the second section of the class, they clarified from the first run. Which meant there were some "thought bubbles" over the video to correct them. The later programming assignments were hard, but very rewarding. I'm glad I took this class.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>104</course_id><course_title>Programming Languages</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>1207</review_data_id><review_date>2013-10-20</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>About 15 years ago I took a Programming Languages class from my university's CS department. The Coursera Programming Languages matches (or exceeds) this traditional course in depth, quality of presentation, and difficulty. This course covers most of the standard topics in an upper-division Programming Languages course including typing (weak vs. strong, static vs. dynamic), functions as first-class objects, functional programming, object-oriented programming, subtyping, and more. The languages covered were SML, Racket, and Ruby. The course took time and the homeworks and exams were sometimes challenging but ultimately very rewarding. The presentation was quite polished and the notes and supplementary material (pdfs, videos, etc.) were of very high quality. I enjoyed the peer-reviews, although sometimes some of the comments made me mad. The teacher (Dan Grossman from U of Washington) knows the material thoroughly and clearly enjoys teaching it.

I have no formal education in programming languages as I studied chemistry at university to a PhD level. I will start with the basics: I thoroughly recommend this course If you have some interest in programming. Prof Grossman and his team have been incredibly thorough about the course material and it's content. The course gives you a really good "big picture view" of the differences between functional and object oriented programming (which I didn't understand at all before the course) as well as a taste of three very different languages. Note, this course will challenge you. This is a good thing, there is no point to a course if you breeze through it without trying. I consider myself to be an educated person, but I struggled with some of the homework assignments. However, this is EXACTLY why I enjoyed it so much - finishing an assignment was incredibly rewarding. If you have looked at some programming guides yourself, and want to finally learn something rigorous and interesting, then this is a great course to go for.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>104</course_id><course_title>Programming Languages</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>1194</review_data_id><review_date>2013-03-25</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>A challenging, yet very rewarding course. Not a beginner's course, and not a course on learning new programming languages. Instead, it focuses on giving insights into common PL concepts and principles, with a greater focus on functional programming (as a contrast to what most people already know before taking this course). Dan Grossman's lecturing is kind of nerdy, which may not be for everyone. But totally OK for me, and I hope that for any CS enthusiast. His passion for the topic was really contagious. All topics were well presented and explained, I didn't struggle to understand anything. (That said, I've already met most of the concepts, but some of them many years ago and my understanding of them was far from perfect). The workload was high, around 3 hours of video for every module plus an assignment or exam; with a little more than a week for every module. The parts on ML and Racket (module 1-6) were precisely built and very thorough; the part on Ruby (module 7-8) was focused more on the contrasts with what was shown previously (the language description was much briefer, but the points were clear). The difficulty of programming assignments was growing with the amount of concepts covered by the lectures, from warm-up to really mindbending (writing an interpreter of a simple language) and it helped digesting the topics introduced in every module's lecture. I didn't like the (last two) Ruby assignments, perhaps because I didn't grow fond of Ruby per se. Peer assessment of the assignments was helpful, but it adds more than an hour to the time consumed by every module (if one tries to be accurate and honest). Personally, I'd prefer more attempts for every homework. In the chosen model, only the first try is with full score, with penalties for the second and no score improvements for further attempts. It's no big deal, but I like a friendlier scoring that guides to making the code perfect, instead of focusing on the score. I'd also prefer softer deadlines, most were little more than a week after the module was available. But I understand that would make the peer assessment less valuable. All in all, a great course, I recommend it to everyone who's serious about programming.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>104</course_id><course_title>Programming Languages</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>1177</review_data_id><review_date>2013-03-19</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>This is not a class about three programming languages - ML, Racket, and Ruby - but a class about programming languages in general, using those three languages to illustrate the design decisions and trade-offs that the creators of programming language make - such as whether to use static or dynamic typing, and whether to support a functional or an object-oriented style of programming. Along the way, you'll get a whirlwind tour of three programming languages, each of exemplify a different combination of programming language attributes: ML is statically typed and functional, Racket is dynamically typed and functional, and Ruby is dynamically typed and object-oriented. The programming assignments are very challenging. You'll implement a simple but Turing-complete programming language "MUPL", which includes first-class functions and closures, in Racket; you'll add functionality to a Tetris game in Ruby; and you'll port a domain-specific language for geometric points, lines, and line segments from ML to Ruby. This class is an excellent complement to Martin Odersky's "Functional Programming in Scala", because it covers a lot of the same concepts, such tail recursion, streams, type inference, and pattern matching on constructors. I took the Scala class before taking this one, but I think they would be just as complementary in the other order. One possible complaint about this class is that you are not provided with unit-testing code for the programming assignments, except for the final one, so it's up to you to write unit tests, which can be time-consuming and a bit tedious. On the other hand, writing unit tests is a skill that a professional programmer needs to develop, and this class gives you plenty of practice.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>104</course_id><course_title>Programming Languages</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>110525</review_data_id><review_date>2015-07-15</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>University of Washington's CS courses are true class, and prof Grossman while already being erudite on the subject conveyed the core ideas excellently with his clear instructions.

The course is fast-paced with 8-16 hours of workload for me (mostly for the assignments). The videos are pretty clear, but because the concepts are pretty difficult I had to watch some of them many times. The learning is reinforced by weekly assignments. The solutions from peers became progressively better over the first half of the course, probably because of student attrition. This course does require some hard work to follow. For me the interpreter and double dispatch assignments were the hardest. This course is unique in using three languages, which takes the attention away from a specific language, and make people focus more on the computational concepts. The concepts covered are close to the ones covered in SICP (http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/).</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>104</course_id><course_title>Programming Languages</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>61296</review_data_id><review_date>2014-12-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>104</course_id><course_title>Programming Languages</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>61066</review_data_id><review_date>2014-12-02</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Great, great, GREAT course.

The professor's enthusiasm is overwhelming in a positive way.The quality of the lectures, materials and assignment are very good. It's definitely not a beginners course, probably not even intermediate, but it teaches a perspective you need in computer science if you want to be professional. I would absolutely recommend this course to every student at my faculty or any faculty at C.S. The course is not about new programming languages, it's based on programming idioms(functional and object oriented), and using them in practice.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>418</course_id><course_title>Linear and Integer Programming</course_title><school>School:  University of Colorado Boulder</school><review_data_id>4678</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-15</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I agree this is another one best course from Coursera.

I took this course to understand the subject; I ended up with the feeling its a great subject with many practical ramifications. I learnt about duality and about ilp (integer + binary linear programming). ILP is very fascinating topic with a lot of practical applications. The programming experience deserves 5 stars. You start by implementing the simplex algorithm and step by step (with some extra effort) you have a full working LP + ILP package. Both Professors are great. They explains hard topics very concisely and clearly. A particular mention goes to Prof. Sriram, he was intensely involved in the discurssion forum and in carrying of the course. What I dislike about the course ? I hope the course will have a part2.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>418</course_id><course_title>Linear and Integer Programming</course_title><school>School:  University of Colorado Boulder</school><review_data_id>3929</review_data_id><review_date>2013-11-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Great course, great coverage of linear and integer programming problems.

The course focuses on teaching the simplex method for optimizing systems linear equations with constraints for the first 4 weeks and then covers integer programming and applications. You should be comfortable with basic linear algebra and calculus before taking this course. The course includes optional programming assignments that allow students to build up their own simplex algorithms over the course of the class, but you can easily pass the course just taking the weekly quizzes. Linear and Integer Programming does an admirable job tacking a dense, dry subject. The instructors are easy to understand and explain confusing concepts well. The presentation style and video quality seem a bit dated, but it doesn't detract much from the learning experience. I must admit that my interest waned as the course went on because I took it due to curiosity than rather than a preexisting interest in the subject. That was a mistake. You should not take this course for fun; take it if you really want to learn about linear programming and have the time to get through all the lectures, supplementary materials and programming assignments. Overall, Linear and Integer Programming is a great course if you want to learn about the simplex algorithm in depth and understand important considerations and applications of linear and integer programming.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>418</course_id><course_title>Linear and Integer Programming</course_title><school>School:  University of Colorado Boulder</school><review_data_id>67376</review_data_id><review_date>2015-01-05</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>418</course_id><course_title>Linear and Integer Programming</course_title><school>School:  University of Colorado Boulder</school><review_data_id>61277</review_data_id><review_date>2014-12-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This was my first math course on a MOOC platform. However it does not entirely deal with the mathematics related with linear programming but also includes some interesting applications, implementing algorithms in your favorite programming language, exposure to scientific computing packages like matlab, cvx and glpk and various optimization techniques. It is a good blend topics that compliment each other and you don't need to be familiar with all of these in order to complete the course. The professors have worked a lot on the material for students to understand the lectures and the presentations were very clear. For me, the programming assignments were quite intimidating but after going through the lecture videos, i was able to complete it. This course has objective problem sets as well and you can attempt either of them (programming assignments or problem sets) in order to receive a certificate of accomplishment so it's a good course for someone with no programming experience to learn about linear optimization (not just linear programming). It is also a great way to learn programming if you are willing to attempt the programing assignments as the lecturers do an excellent job in explaining the simplex algorithm step by step so you don't miss a single detail of how it is implemented on a computer. Even though if you don't wish to build your own linear programming solver, this course also introduces you to many useful LP solvers available in matlab/octave, glpk, excel and python. There was an active participation in the discussion forums and professor shriram was always there for clarifications on any matter related to the course; something which I've never seen in any MOOC I've taken so far. Although I've not participated in the discussion forums I found it very useful to visit whenever i was stuck as the issue was already addressed there. Overall it was a great experience to have successfully completed the course and the interest generated by the instructors will definitely encourage you stick to the end. This course doesn't just teach you about linear programming and integer linear programming but covers a wide range of optimization techniques and computing packages which give you a solid foundation on these topics and will encourage you to explore more.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>418</course_id><course_title>Linear and Integer Programming</course_title><school>School:  University of Colorado Boulder</school><review_data_id>61105</review_data_id><review_date>2014-12-04</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Where is a sixth star when I need it?

His style is moderately informal and friendly, always understandable. There are many slides with a whiteboard capability which he uses throughout. There is an introductory section with a "pre-test" to estimate students' capability for the course, but that should not put anyone off. Following each subsequent section there is a quiz, which is multiple choice. Students have generally 5 attempts at each quiz, with immediate feedback as to which questions were correct and which were incorrect (the course final exam is somewhat different). There were also two peer assessments, one graded and one not, only covering early sections. The course final was interesting and included a number of clinical cases testing one's application of the knowledge presented. There were two course "hangouts" which were online sessions with course participants. Unfortunately this technology is less than optimum, with audio and video issues, and did not seem to be particularly well used by participants. There was a robust course forum, staffed by community TAs with obviously extensive knowledge of neuroscience, with a number of sections that were put to good use by students. Resources to assist students with the course were many, generally easily accessed through the course sidebar on the website, many free. However, the most helpful resources, including the textbook, Neuroscience, and the online atlas, Sylvius, were an extra expense. I found Sylvius helpful but rudimentary and lacking some of the features that Dr White demonstrated in his lectures (this was explained to me as due to the switch from a previously DVD-based format to the online one). It cost about $25 for a year's subscription. I did not buy the textbook but in retrospect wish I had. Most of the illustrations used in the course were from the text, and while one could find them in the lectures, it was a real pain to do so after the fact; I resorted later to taking screenshots of many so that I could refer back to them. I think it would have been much easier to have had the text to refer to and read in concert with the video tutorials. Dr White and his staff provided tutorial notes covering all of the video lectures. When referred to separately, they were somewhat difficult to follow. I would recommend students print them out (admittedly an expense) and refer to them while initially watching the tutorials, so that individual notes could be taken directly on them. Another option would be to have a separate computer screen for the notes, but that is probably beyond the means of most. I think Dr White's estimate that the course requires approximately 15 - 20 hours per week of study is generally accurate. Someone with a prior background in the subject could likely get by with simply watching the videos, and reviewing the notes, but this still will take 5 - 10 hours. There is a section of the sidebar labelled "Keeping Pace" which is very helpful given the demands of the couse. In summary, this is a superb course, easily equal to anything offered on the subject and taught directly in a university setting. I highly recommend it. Kudos to Dr White and his colleagues!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>62</course_id><course_title>Medical Neuroscience</course_title><school>School:  Duke University</school><review_data_id>119840</review_data_id><review_date>2016-03-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I have found this Course very instructive, deeply worked through, very professionally given, with many pupils and participants eager to collaborate and add up to the immense sum of knowledge and suggestions for research expressed in this passionate field of Neuroscience.

Reaching the finish line with such an outcome of knowledge, is not only based on one's hard work (and do expect that's what it takes!), but also to a high extend, how the learning material is passed on to the student. The course is spectacular in it's structure and organization to give the best outcome, if you work for it. The learning is provided by a remarkably proficient and sympathetic professor, Prof.White and a just as remarkable staff behind him. We are a huge worldwide community, who are very devoted to Prof.White - so brace your brain and mind for the impact!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>62</course_id><course_title>Medical Neuroscience</course_title><school>School:  Duke University</school><review_data_id>119474</review_data_id><review_date>2016-03-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Excellent course.

The course content, as an introductory overview to the field of neuroscience, is very broad (the video lectures are lengthy, and a chore to sit through). The exam integrates material from different course units (i.e. tests your ability to integrate material learnt in different course units). The 2016 cohort year will be the last time it is offered with the Statement of Accomplishment.

The instructor is reaaaally nice and admirable, he gives the lectures as real classes not reading some script, and that makes it more real-class experience. I have no complaints about the course at all, only that I'd love a 2nd round and maybe... 1-2 weeks more for the lectures --&gt; peer assessments (as the quizzes are open till the end of the course).</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>62</course_id><course_title>Medical Neuroscience</course_title><school>School:  Duke University</school><review_data_id>119024</review_data_id><review_date>2016-03-02</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Everything about the course is fantastic, especially the clinical cases and practical, applied and functional systems knowledge presented. One thing that grates on me a little bit is the non-equivalent difficulty level of some of the quizzes presented within the same units (assuming you are presented the option to take it multiple times for best score in the first three without penalty). Some are significantly more difficult than others within the same unit. Therefore it is very important to be well-prepared before taking any of the quizzes because if you happen to get the easier ones first you will have to strike while the iron is hot especially if you are taking signature track or wish to get a certificate with distinction. You may not see that ease of difficulty if you take it multiple times if presented with an easier one first.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>62</course_id><course_title>Medical Neuroscience</course_title><school>School:  Duke University</school><review_data_id>118885</review_data_id><review_date>2016-02-28</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Great course.

The course isn't easy one, but so is the topic of the course, especially for a person who had only basic knowledge about it at the beginning. Since my interest in neuroscience has no connection to my profession field I allowed myself to skip some of tests and task but faithfully watched all video tutorials. It has amazing and rich content and provides not only a brief introduction like most of courses on this topic but allows to dive into subject and explore more difficult and complex themes. The course was a real challenge to me but I truly loved it.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>62</course_id><course_title>Medical Neuroscience</course_title><school>School:  Duke University</school><review_data_id>73988</review_data_id><review_date>2015-04-06</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Absolutely phenomenal teacher .

The first unit was a fantastic review of some of those basic concepts and built a more in-depth understanding of the cellular processes involved. Given that background, and it was a couple of decades into the past, getting through and keeping up with this course was a tremendous challenge. The content provided is exceptional. I did purchase the optional textbook and used the textbook website to quiz my retention of the information regularly. I also used the optional Sylvius website, which also was incredibly helpful. The instructor, Dr. White, is fantastic. He has a sweet personality and gentle nature on camera that's endearing. I know this isn't necessary for learning the material, but it helped greatly that he didn't have any annoying mannerisms that detracted from the teachings. His presence is quite the opposite. As for the platform itself, I can say that Coursera doesn't have one of the best classroom forum organizational structures among the MOOC selections. Regardless, the TAs are incredibly knowledgeable, attentive and helpful. You can be assured if you post a question that there will be a knowledgeable response to it within 24 hours, and often times within an hour or less. This is highly impressive. The forums are managed well and it's rare to see a rude and/or insensitive comment go unaddressed. All in all, this was a huge time commitment for me, and one that I'm incredibly grateful to have had the opportunity to work toward. I did finish, I did pass, and I did earn the verified certificate, all making it a worthwhile undertaking. In the end, even if I hadn't achieved a passing grade and certificate, the knowledge gained in the attempt would have enhanced my understanding of myself and those around me. Anyone who dares to take on the same challenge will see what I mean within the first week or two.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>62</course_id><course_title>Medical Neuroscience</course_title><school>School:  Duke University</school><review_data_id>73876</review_data_id><review_date>2015-03-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Hard work, but totally worth it.

Peer review was a component along with quizzes for grading.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>196</course_id><course_title>Archaeology's Dirty Little Secrets</course_title><school>School:  Brown University</school><review_data_id>3786</review_data_id><review_date>2013-11-13</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This was the first MOOC I ever took and, after a few more under my belt, easily the best. The production values were top-notch and Sue Alcock was great. Her easygoing attitude made it feel like you had wandered into her office and asked what you could expect if you decided to major in Archaeology. While the material itself wasn't terribly difficult, the assignments were time consuming. Everybody seemed to put in a lot of effort into both the assignments and the peer-reviewed critiques. I learned quite a bit about the fundamentals of archaeology, and, more importantly, I learned that I wasn't meant for this career path. It was nice to figure that out and still get so much enjoyment out of this course. Highly recommended.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>196</course_id><course_title>Archaeology's Dirty Little Secrets</course_title><school>School:  Brown University</school><review_data_id>3324</review_data_id><review_date>2013-09-30</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This was my first MOOC, and was very good.

The course is organized very well, with a lot of material complementary to the lectures such as worthwhile readings and interviews with practicing archeologists as well as some 'lab demonstrations' to watch. Another real strong point of the class is the assignments: there is a choice in each assignment of which you prefer to complete, so you can channel your creativity, yet you grade all types so you can see and learn about the tasks others chose to complete. I found the assignments particularly useful and enlightening. Professor "Sue" is charming, funny and a great speaker - perfect balance of good information but still introductory.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>196</course_id><course_title>Archaeology's Dirty Little Secrets</course_title><school>School:  Brown University</school><review_data_id>2978</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-15</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I have just finished my first two courses on Coursera and have taken a couple of courses from Udacity.

The course runs about 8 weeks and covers a considerable amount of ground in that time. It starts with the basics of data and data collection methods but quickly moves on to cover probability, the normal distribution, the binomial distribution, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, Z and T statistics, ANOVA and Chi squared tests and linear regression. The course is a bit of a whirlwind tour that packs a lot into each lecture. The PDF slides that go along with the videos are a great resource to review the information dumped in each lecture. Many students complained that the course requires more time than the original estimated amount of around 6-8 hours per week. The course was later updated with an estimate of 8-10 hours per week, which is on the conservative side. If you come in with some prior knowledge of stats and R you can get through in 3-5 hours per week. The professor is engaging and does a good job going through the material while providing adequate face time. The slides are very informative and the video quality is excellent. There are periodic in-lecture quizzes that help test your understanding of the material as you go along. I felt that the frequency of in-lecture quizzes was just about right in this course. Grading is based on performance on weekly quizzes one midterm and one final exam. You need a cumulative grade of 80 percent or more to get a certificate and you only have 1 attempt on the exams, so it is a bit harder to earn a certificate in this course than it is for most MOOCs. If you choose to go the computational route, a portion of your grade is based on 8 programming labs using the R programming language. You can do the labs on your own or use a convenient web-based programming environment provided by the instructor. The labs provide a basic introduction to R and each one explores some of the concepts introduced in the lectures. The labs take about 30 minutes to an hour and a half depending on your level of experience with programming and R. In the computational track you’ll also complete a final project involving a statistical analysis of two variables, either from a data set provided by the instructor or a data set you find on your own. The project lets you use the concepts you’ve learned both in class and in lecture on your own. I suspect the project is a bit intimidating to those who are new to R because it involves more computation than the labs and you don’t have the training wheels that the labs provide. The project grade is based on the median score of 3 or more peer assessments. This is a great course for anyone looking to learn statistics that moves fast enough not to bore those who know a bit of statistics coming into the course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>12695</course_id><course_title>Data Analysis and Statistical Inference </course_title><school>School:  Duke University</school><review_data_id>33986</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-30</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This was a truly awesome course; and ought to be a benchmark for not only statistics courses (John Hopkins, are you listening?), but for all MOOCs as well. The lectures are crisp and clear. Dr. Mine engages you with interesting examples all throughout. You can see for yourself how much effort the team has put into making the course content. I can go on and on about how well paced and relevant the quizzes, labs(via datacamp, another wonderful offering from Duke), mid-terms, project and the final exam have been. You literally have to sweat it out in order to get past these hurdles. But in the end, you feel it is all worth it. I don't have anything to dislike about the course. Through the discussion forums, I could see students leave with a lump in their throat after the course got over. I think that sums up everything.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>12695</course_id><course_title>Data Analysis and Statistical Inference </course_title><school>School:  Duke University</school><review_data_id>7161</review_data_id><review_date>2014-08-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Great, course. A well balanced mixture of theory, examples, labs and projects to test your skills in the 'real' world. The teacher explains the concepts very clearly. The course layout and order of topics is excellent. The difficulty is does not change overall. The free and open textbook is the best I've come across. It is packed with footnotes to datasets, and has more than enough examples and exercises to get you through the midterm and the exam. The teacher is very active on the forums and even organized a Google hangout session you can join. The focus of this course is definitely not on mathematical proofs, probability theory or working through problems analytically, but geared towards practical approaches using given formula's or R to get results on every day problems. Integrated into the course is the datacamp environment that helps you to learn the software R by playing with data. The nature of these task mirror the theory discussed that week. There are some glitches in this new environment (during the first run of this course), and the tasks are not really challenging. The quizzes are quite good. Many of the questions test your insight rather than ask you to do tedious algebra. The peer reviewed research projects are time consuming, great fun and an excellent way to get your hands wet with real data, R and doing some real data analysis. One of the best courses I've taken.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>12695</course_id><course_title>Data Analysis and Statistical Inference </course_title><school>School:  Duke University</school><review_data_id>74119</review_data_id><review_date>2015-04-24</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I first learned about this course in Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization courses. Students talked about this course in a very positive manner. I became very curious about this course and I decided to take it. I am really satisfied with what I have learned and I feel very good about statistics now. It completely removed my bad memories of statistics. This course was nicely organized with very flexible schedule (no need for late days), phenomenal use of real world examples and beautiful slides (Sometimes I could not take my eyes off the slides). The exercises were carefully designed and I could learn simply by watching videos and doing exercises. (I did nothing special) If you are new to statistics, do not lose this course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>12695</course_id><course_title>Data Analysis and Statistical Inference </course_title><school>School:  Duke University</school><review_data_id>59826</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-09</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course should be a model for all other MOOCs, and really shows the potential for what MOOCs can offer in terms of (free) online learning. The amount of work that has gone into putting this course together is really quite astounding and shows in just about every aspect of the course. The lectures are great and the professor is very talented. You cover a huge amount of ground very quickly, and for people new to statistics or who don't have a strong maths background (like me, the last time I studied maths was over 10 years ago!) can struggle a bit in places. However, there is also a very good free-to-download course textbook which helps explain each topic in more detail, so if you're struggling with one of the lectures this is a great reference point. Another excellent aspect of this course is that all of the things you learned are illustrated using real life examples There are very clear learning objectives established for each module, which helps greatly with revision. The quizzes and particularly the exams are difficult - they really make you think about what you have learned. You can't just look over your notes and pick the right answers - you actually have to apply the knowledge. The forums are also very helpful for when you're struggling with a particular aspect of the course - even the professor posts there! The optional R content and the corresponding project are a must - if you don't think you have the time to do this part then I would suggest delay taking this course until you do, as there's only so much of the course you can really apply without the use of statistical software. This part of the course was also very well structured - taking you from a complete beginner in R programming to being able to put together a data analysis project report using only R. All in all, if you're looking for an introductory statistics course - this is the one to choose!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>12695</course_id><course_title>Data Analysis and Statistical Inference </course_title><school>School:  Duke University</school><review_data_id>30844</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-06</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Introductory course in Data Analysis, but not an easy, pass for all course. The teacher is VERY good, and her lectures are always interesting, complemented by very good planned slides. She explains the concepts very clear, even if a little fast.

The labs are easy and fast, and designed so that everyone gets 100% just going through them.

I was kind of apprehensive in the beginning, since it deals with religion. In reality, I was very pleasantly surprised with the tone of the course. The lectures are neutral and balanced. This is about History, not Theology. It presents an overview of the way the jewish Bible was produced, the reasons behind it and the society of the time, as well as what we can learn and take away from it. There are very few negatives. Maybe the course could be a bit longer (6 weeks is nothing). Maybe the quizzes could be a bit more challenging - a peer- reviewed assessment could help. There is mandatory forum participation worth 5% of the grade, which I hate - in courses such as this you really need to stay away from the forum (which is true always, but courses involving religious topics make particularly irritating and worthless forum discussions). Finally, I personally felt a bit lost in the segments sometimes; sometimes I felt the narrative in the lecture wasn't very clear. However, the course is so good that these negatives are pretty small if you look at the big picture. I couldn't recommend this course more if this is a topic that appeals to you.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>12677</course_id><course_title>The Bible's Prehistory, Purpose, and Political Future</course_title><school>School:  Emory University</school><review_data_id>37394</review_data_id><review_date>2014-06-30</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I will highly recommend this course to others when offered again.  The material is that which many need to know for a greater understanding of the Bible in its own setting and origins.  Much of this was new to me and the reading recommendations were priceless as were all the class videos.  Dr Wright has hit a home run in my opinion and I am sure future courses from him will be even more so.  Thanks!!!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>12677</course_id><course_title>The Bible's Prehistory, Purpose, and Political Future</course_title><school>School:  Emory University</school><review_data_id>37390</review_data_id><review_date>2014-06-30</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I wrote an earlier review, but it has not come up on the posts.

Dr. Wright went the extra mile by having an active presence in the discussion forum, the Facebook group, and by holding "office hours" via Google Hangout. He fostered a positive and fun atmosphere in which we developed into a true learning community in the Facebook group.

Mostly independent study from a variety of sources. No formal academic background in this area. I have been taking MOOCs for a little less than a year and usually end up taking three at a time. I know MOOCs have only been around for a few years, but I feel, "Where have you been all my life?" Here is a free, all-you-can-learn buffet that only a fraction of the online population is even aware of. How does this course compare to others? Lots of information that is understandable to a person who lacks background, but still eye-opening to one who has background in this discipline. Clear, organized presentation and excellent guest lectures added to the course. Nominated for Best-dressed Coursera professor :) by his Facebook audience. I hope to see a sequel. Perhaps this course should be in clinical trials for treatment of bibliophobia, the fear of approaching or appreciating biblical literature and exploring its meaning as well as historical and modern significance. Maybe the next course should be, "Who's Afraid of the Big, Bad Bible?" What did you like/dislike about the course? I really like the fact that an enthusiastic community has formed around this class, and Dr. Wright is interested in being engaged with his students, more than I have experienced in any Coursera or edX that I have taken. If Dr. Wright ever led a tour or dig to the historical sites, it would make an incredible MOOC offering. I think the course might be improved by adding an optional related assignment that is peer-reviewed, like another course I took. I would have liked to have participated in the Google hangout, but must have missed seeing this posted until the following day.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>12677</course_id><course_title>The Bible's Prehistory, Purpose, and Political Future</course_title><school>School:  Emory University</school><review_data_id>37487</review_data_id><review_date>2014-07-04</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This was my first Coursera course, and I really loved the wonderful ideas presented and the very eloquent presentation.

Previously, I work along with team that used traditional means for running a business or any project but with the passage of time, market experts and entrepreneurs added various new techniques to ensure the success of every project. With my knowledge that I learn from the course, I am of the option that every single organization use project management due to its extraordinary benefits. Different people use different words for explaining project management but the basic definition or core concept I understand about project management it that it always remains same. It can be defined as any action plan or program that makes use of every strategy and technique that may help in the successful completion of any project. It may also refer to planning, organizing, leading and controlling the resources both human and physical to achieve the project goals efficiently and effectively as entrepreneurs and company executive’s deal with the daily responsibilities of managing an organization, it is important to use dedicated project managers to oversee projects from conception to completion. Understanding effective project management techniques helps organizations carry out large-scale projects on time, on budget and with minimal disruption to the rest of the business.

Just as promised, lots of fundamentals with hands-on experience examples. I would like to see a bit more of actual fiddling with numbers in spreadsheets. I know there were a few videos about MS Project, but it's way too expensive for a student, novice, or a self-taught PM working in a small company. And formulas were not really shown, rather functions of the soft. Lots of MS Project functionality is based on formulas, so if an MS Excel template is available, then we can do a lot with that -- before obtaining MS Project ;-) Thanks for a great course and experience. Cheers to a very good teacher!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50780</course_id><course_title>Fundamentals of Project Planning and Management</course_title><school>School:  University of Virginia</school><review_data_id>117430</review_data_id><review_date>2016-01-09</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Dear Yael &amp; team of University of Virginia, I am writing this on completion of Fundamentals of Project Planning and Management from Bangalore,India.

I have got my initial basement to progress more in this field, this is how Coursera, most importantly the instructor helped me to have the dream to build my career in Management.

My only feedback for improvement is to make sure that the quiz answers are completely accurate and have a better forum for questioning if answers are incorrect.

Thus, lean a lot more with this course than what I thought I would. I have new tools to use, not only at work but also for personal projects. For instance, a friend of mine is planning her daughter's 15th birthday party and I am giving her a good hand, we have gone through a rich brainstorm, put the ideas on a map, on a breakdown structure we downloaded MS project and we are 98% on line with what was planned. Now we have to revise the critical path to make decisions on what to do to catch up. I hope this brushing up of her untidy plan will help her indeed and make a real success of this special event. At work it has been very useful too, I am usually involved in projects and my boss has well noted I was atending a course on project management because I have come up once and again with new ideas and different approaches on how to face our projects. I am very happy for having taken this course and I congratulste the teacher for her clarity and profesionalism. I am sur e this will be a very useful tool for any project I will have to face in the future. ****************************</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50780</course_id><course_title>Fundamentals of Project Planning and Management</course_title><school>School:  University of Virginia</school><review_data_id>113272</review_data_id><review_date>2015-09-21</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I learnt a lot with this course.

It has been a good mix of theory and practical information. I liked that the instructor linked the theory to current challenges, and that she clearly explained how the nature of a project can vary. She was also good to highlight important aspects often underestimated or forgotten when running a project. Good information about commercial tools. If the course would have been longer I prefer some thoughts of the challenges around important key personnel in the project and how to perform a post mortem.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50780</course_id><course_title>Fundamentals of Project Planning and Management</course_title><school>School:  University of Virginia</school><review_data_id>112953</review_data_id><review_date>2015-09-14</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>It was a really nice experience.

Online courses are a really good way of expanding your knowledge, but the crucial part is -of course- the verified certification (on the other hand it is non-credited).

The math is clearly and simply presented. Exercises are ok, but some very simple and direct. The Schedule Performance Index and Cost Performance Index are great assess. The course would have discussed Human resources management and Information Management(Communication) in detail. The course content should be expanded to have International outlook. E.g. Failure of projects in most developing countries is corruption(over inflated contracts, inconsistent policy, "political projects"-to score political goals not for development projects etc. Prof Yael showed indepth knowledge of the course, with interesting application of her numerate background. She presented the course in its ABC level for everybody to understand. She is a material and deserves more reward. She is a born and all round teacher, bringing humour at the right time. She is very friendly and jovial. I enjoy playing the video and looking up the day I will present a project challenge to her.Thumbs up for her. Every other thing about the course is good. Leslie Cook plays her part very well.

I am a practicing Project Manager and Project Management Professional (PMP). Initially, I joined for the purpose of acquiring PDU's as part of the ongoing professional development requirement of the PMP certification. I did not expect to learn anything. However, to my surprise I found the course to be an excellent refresher. What I thought to be particularly insightful were the actual applications of the Torando Charts, Monte Carlo Simulations and PERT analyis given in Week 3. These concepts were introduced during my preparatory course for PMP Certification, but were not explained in any detail. Yael is very engaging in her lectures and the course presents a simple yet wholesome approach to Project Management. Leslie and the team of TA's are also very quick to respond and clarify any queries so beginners can be assured that they will not be left hanging at any point throughout the duration of the course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50780</course_id><course_title>Fundamentals of Project Planning and Management</course_title><school>School:  University of Virginia</school><review_data_id>112939</review_data_id><review_date>2015-09-13</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>The course was short and informative.

For someone new to PM, the course is presented in an easy to understand approach. For experienced PMs, it allows one to streamline one's understanding of the planning processes -IPECC. There are two small aspects I would be happy to see changed.One, the cost of these courses and certificates is really subsidized but if PM is going to be improved in Africa, it would be best to sacrifice even further and provide it free. This sounds selfish on my part but I speak from an informed position of salaries in the West Vs those in Africa. The average project manager in a local NGO in Africa would be lucky to receive 300 dollars a month! Then there is another hindrance-lack of master card/credit card to facilitate payment. Yes, there is PAL which involves going to a bank, but that is a put off for many. For Somalia, there is no commercial bank whatsoever although two or so money transfer services are trying to transform into "international commercial banks" I personally have an experience of having paid 40 dollars in commission to send 50 dollars to Sweden. It also took two weeks as the process involved the local institution sending money through a bank in Dubai!! In all honesty, it is my appeal that all applicants from Somalia be exempted from fees. The same argument goes for recommended books. If possible, the course organizers could consider providing excerpts relevant to each course unit. That said, as an experienced person with many years of service, I would personally be happy to offer volunteer services to Darden business school as a way of paying back the generosity. Thanks again for an excellent course. PS would it be possible for the school to put in place a mechanism for following up o this course to get an PMP certification?</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50780</course_id><course_title>Fundamentals of Project Planning and Management</course_title><school>School:  University of Virginia</school><review_data_id>75049</review_data_id><review_date>2015-05-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is greatest course I've ever got: interesting, many good examples and reading materials.

They may not have any prior knowledge or training on PM. The course 'Fundamentals of Project Planning and Management' is an excellent introduction to the subject. It covers the key concepts of project planning and execution and the critical factors that could contribute to project failures. The course is highly useful to practicing project managers as well as students who want to gain a fundamental understanding about project management. I would also highly recommend this 4 weeks course to anyone who is about to start their career in any area of business. Almost anyone will have to either lead a project or be a part of the project team at some stage in their career. This course will give you the basic skills and knowledge essential to perform well in such roles. Professor Yale Gruska-Cockayne has proved that she is a great teacher. She was also deeply involved in interacting with the learners at the discussion forums and google hangout sessions. The course offers you a statement of accomplishment if you score an aggregate of 75% or above for the weekly quizzes.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50780</course_id><course_title>Fundamentals of Project Planning and Management</course_title><school>School:  University of Virginia</school><review_data_id>75046</review_data_id><review_date>2015-05-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Firstly the course Instructor is absolutely great in terms of explanations and her way she tends to stress on things while explaining things , it just gave me a feeling as if I am attending a real class room training and have to give credit to professor who lead this course with Witt and grip on subject.

I felt involved. As an introduction, it is a good material. I work with project management and this is a subject that demands a continuous learning. It is not just about knowing tools and concepts related to this field, but for the project management professionals, it is required a constant evaluation of the projects and different environments which they are involved in order to apply whatever is suitable. Courses like this one help to clarify and keep fresh what is available in terms of shared knowledge on the subject. And for those who are willing to get a certification, materials like the one available here is really good for studying and memorizing. I recommend.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50780</course_id><course_title>Fundamentals of Project Planning and Management</course_title><school>School:  University of Virginia</school><review_data_id>74978</review_data_id><review_date>2015-05-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This was one of the best introductory to project management I've ever taken, I did really like the way Professor Yael instructed course and her best use of real life examples.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50780</course_id><course_title>Fundamentals of Project Planning and Management</course_title><school>School:  University of Virginia</school><review_data_id>74975</review_data_id><review_date>2015-05-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course content was excellent.

The experience at the very beginning of the class is very confusing due to the reverse order of the blog style updates featured on the landing page. I finished taking all of the quizzes, passed them, and am not quite sure where I currently stand. When I took UCI's exams, I automatically received a certification achievement notification in e-mail. I didn't get that with this class and don't know if I'm waiting on an automated batch process, or a manual review process. The start / end nature of this class is probably what's throwing me off as it's the first time I've encountered it on the Coursera exams that I've taken.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50780</course_id><course_title>Fundamentals of Project Planning and Management</course_title><school>School:  University of Virginia</school><review_data_id>74873</review_data_id><review_date>2015-05-23</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>The formatting of the course id very clear and informative, i was able to understand all the concepts.

I would like to suggest to put more pictures in the explanations. There aren't god pictures to improve what the teacher have being said. I think she could stay more time talking behind the posts. Project Management is very important in Brazil nowadays because we are planning the next Olympic and Paralympics games. I think you could prepare some material about this, using examples from others games and plans like this. I am certainly that many gays would like to enroll a course that has information to prepare a god plan. Sometimes the instructor doesn't have fluency in to give all the information or she explain that faster. The opportunity to do this course online is a great. Thank you for give us this course and many others in this University.

The lecturer is fantastic. She has shown her thorough understanding the subject. My suggestion is that when doing the lecture it is better to display the presentation while doing the narration in back ground voice. It doesn't mean that lecturer should'e shown. It is a great job.

Since we don't have much chance to do a big project, I really hope there will be more case studies or even just one more, but as detailed as possible. Although there are examples in this course, I don't think it is detailed enough for us to really understand some concepts. I suggest a assignment of WBS or something will be really helpful for us to understand, we may have a better understanding when compared to a true one with ours</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>50780</course_id><course_title>Fundamentals of Project Planning and Management</course_title><school>School:  University of Virginia</school><review_data_id>74686</review_data_id><review_date>2015-05-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Extremely interesting, great instructor, very well organised and valuable insights into project management techniques.

However, I would like to see more practical guide in video lecture. I would also like to learn how to build a monitoring and evaluation system to control project execution. The forum discussion helped me to understand well the course concepts. The instructor made lot of effort to make the course enjoyable. She explained the course in a plain language, clearly so that nonnative English student can easily understand. The course is provided in the right way. I did not meet any technical difficulty to read video lecture are to take the quizzes. In one word, this course is good for beginners like me to start career in project management. I would like to thank the Instructor for providing us this course. I also thank Coursera for this initiative because it help developing world student like me to learn the best courses from the best instructors from the best universities.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>63</course_id><course_title>Learn to Program: The Fundamentals</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>405</review_data_id><review_date>2012-11-20</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I signed up for several different introductory CS courses (LTP1 and ITPP on Coursera, CS50x and 6.00x on EdX) and I have to say that this was the best one. Demanding but not too much - about 4-4,5h/week, very thorough but not boring (the disjointed teching, that somebody here has complained about, was for me a major upside - I found out that 6-10 minutes lectures are easier to stomach than those gargantuan 2h lectures on EdX [I can easily sit and listen for such time in real life auditorium but in front of my computer I get all twitchy and my attention floats away]). This course did not cover a huge range of topic but when it touched one, it would not stop until this topic was covered 100%. Also the professors were very active on the forum and woud answer questions, provide clarifications and respond to feedback. There were also a few downsides but, interestingly enough, most of them - technical: problems with final exam grading (resolving this mess sure took some time), differing level of sound during some of the videos and a total, horrible mess on the discussion forum. But that would be about it - I frankly cannot even think of a bad thing to say about the teaching part. It was so great that I just can't wait for the LTP2.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>63</course_id><course_title>Learn to Program: The Fundamentals</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>3648</review_data_id><review_date>2013-10-31</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>With no programming or math background, moderate intellectual capacity, and very limited time for studying, I successfully completed this course and am keen to use and build up the new skill in practice. I loved everything about this course: not a word too much, no digressions, no confusion, immediate hands-on experience. There are a few things that might differ from other courses: the videos are cut in very short sequences with a lot of intermittent quizzes. Some might find it disturbing, but I found it very helpful. There is no fuss with late days or penalizations between the due date and the hard deadline for your homework. A summary comes with every lecture: real notes "to take home"! Both lecturers speak a very comprehensible English and they are excellent presenters in general. "Learn to Program: The Fundamentals" was one of the best courses in my education career, live lectures included!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>63</course_id><course_title>Learn to Program: The Fundamentals</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>1444</review_data_id><review_date>2013-05-03</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I work as a software developer and have a good understanding of programming stuff. I'm quite familiar with c, java and also worked with Ruby which is quite similar to python. However i was looking for a Python Primer (may be because of its popularity) and this course felt like the right thing. In addition i also joined one python based course on eDX in parallel which is like almost 1 semester long. Needless to say, this course worked perfectly for me i got almost 100% of effort invested in this course. On contrary with eDX though i came close, but still i left it due to shortage of time and too much workload. I think this course is good enough if you are looking for a python intro. The best thing about course is short easy to grasp lectures which makes handling the workload easy enough. I don't like to leave course in between but sometimes you have to when you can't balance it with your work. It happened with eDX and i'm happy that this time it didn't.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>63</course_id><course_title>Learn to Program: The Fundamentals</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>1461</review_data_id><review_date>2013-05-03</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I started to learn python with this course as a absolute beginner in computer science.

This is the best introductory programming class I have taken, and they don't mess around. You will learn everything you should learn to get started with Python 3.3 (and of course the principles apply to other languages as well). They go over things that other courses don't really mention, like good documentation, how to design a program, and how the computer runs through the program and handles the memory. Truly enlightening. It is rather fast paced, and I think it really helps to have at least a tiny bit of experience in programming, a total newbie who doesn't know the difference between an integer and a floating point will probably struggle to keep up.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>63</course_id><course_title>Learn to Program: The Fundamentals</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>475</review_data_id><review_date>2012-11-30</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I work in IT but have a non-technical background. I work with programmers; I'm not a programmer myself. I took this course both to help me professionally (I'd like a better understanding of what I am asking people to do; I'd like it to be easier for programming staff to explain issues/challenges to me) and personally (this is something I want to learn for my own edification). The course is very well-structured. The instructors have done a very effective job of dividing topics into videos of a good length for individual learning and the embedded quizzes are well designed to reinforce learning (at least, it worked well for me). I found this course very effective for getting basic, foundational knowledge. I simultaneously took another coursera course on programming in Python (An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python, Rice University, Joe Warren, Scott Rixner, John Greiner, Stephen Wong) which I thought went well with this - the Toronto class is great at the basics; the Rice class is less effective in communicating the basic lessons, but the mini projects are challenging and really helped that knowledge coalesce for me. If you're a novice who'd like an intro to programming, I think this course is a great place to start.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>63</course_id><course_title>Learn to Program: The Fundamentals</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>372</review_data_id><review_date>2012-11-10</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Firstly, let me preface this by saying that I've spent the past year studying C, Python (very briefly), Perl and Java at my university so I already have a pretty good foundation. This made learning the course easier to handle. This course began about 7 weeks ago but I only signed up earlier this week. As such, I didn't have the option to attempt the exercises because the deadline already passed. What I have done is go through all the video lectures and quizzes 1-5 so my review will reflect those parts. For people new to programming, the learning curve may be a tad steep especially when the concept of 'pointers' is explained from the very start but I feel this only serves to benefit the student in the long term and get them to start thinking about the underlying mechanisms behind the code. It definitely crystalised my understanding. The lecturers use of the code visualiser, clear step-by-step explanations for the layman and annotations were extremely helpful but sometimes, they would explain code over and over again in subsequent lectures. Eg. one lecture talks about ranges and the student should understand what it does before continuing onto the next lecture. It's not necessary to describe what range does in subsequent lectures. It just slows the pacing of lectures and distracts from learning new concepts. On the plus side, I really liked the interactive multiple choice questions presented mid lecture. One person commented on the monotony of the lecturers and although it has some merit, it shouldn't detract those genuinely interested from doing this course. Apart from that, I felt this was a solid and well structured course for beginners who really want to learn good habits and practices in programming. The quizzes (multiple choice) really test your understanding of the syntax and semantics.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>63</course_id><course_title>Learn to Program: The Fundamentals</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>61387</review_data_id><review_date>2014-12-26</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>63</course_id><course_title>Learn to Program: The Fundamentals</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>42013</review_data_id><review_date>2014-07-20</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Despite being my first MOOC I felt very comfortable.

It's free, and so ensures that the natural constraints that would otherwise lead to single mindedness for both teacher and student is avoided completely. There is a true sense of freedom in being able to take an online course, in something you're truly passionate about, as opposed to the usual academia rubbish forcing every decision you make, from classes to test taking to the time you get up in the morning; there is just something magical about the whole MOOC experience. However, this is only true insofar as the teachers of a course are competent enough. I find that both Jennifer and Paul are excellent in teaching the subject content, and are obviously passionate about what they teach, making others passionate in what they are learning, and for that, I thank them.

It teaches one language, Python, in a very slow-paced manner (one week for for-loops, another for while-loops, and another for for-loops OVER INDICES), but it manages to cover enough in seven weeks for its students to become comfortable with the very basics of Python and be able to explore new things on their own. In particular, taking this course first has helped me keep up with the much faster-paced Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python from Rice University on Coursera, and Introduction to Computer Science and Programming with Python from MIT on EdX. Taking this course first has allowed me several weeks to get comfortable with things like iteration and string manipulation. The teaching is fairly decent, though the professor's voices can lull you to sleep at times. The majority of videos are taken up by the IDLE interpreter, with the professor/s typing out programs as they speak. The professors make a lot of typos which they then correct in the same video, which was good because everyone makes typos and it helped emphasize how small things can lead to total program failure. The instructors also made extensive use of the Python visualizer tool to emphasize the logic of how programs are executed, which helped me understand recursion later on in a separate course. The assessments were surprisingly challenging. The quizzes were pretty tricky and featured many debugging problems (what's wrong with this code/which of these programs will work?). Many people sweated for days on the three problem sets/assignments, but the assignment writeups were written very well, allowing sufficient guidance but not giving away the answers. Here's an example of an assignment (a word search game): http://spark- public.s3.amazonaws.com/programming1/a3/a3.html This course is recommended for anyone who wants to learn the very basics of programming. But people with even just a little bit of prior experience may find the pace way too slow.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>63</course_id><course_title>Learn to Program: The Fundamentals</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>3673</review_data_id><review_date>2013-11-01</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Frankly, the only online course I completed, cause of the simplicity in approach, the learning material, videos, exercises, etc. Made it a point to complete watching the videos, doing the exercises and the assignment the same day.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>63</course_id><course_title>Learn to Program: The Fundamentals</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>3672</review_data_id><review_date>2013-11-01</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>When I started this course, i had never used Python, although I use C and C++.

My only regret is that I felt very last lectures were going a bit fast on a few notions (when you start getting out of Python frame to call external files), though that seemed as a key for further explorations in programming. Exercises and assignements were really satisfying as you could feel the progression of your learning, and opening on application fields ideas. Thanks a lot Paul &amp; Jen, really appreciated taking this course, and looking forward for the next level! It was my first coursera course, I hope all future ones will be as stimulating as this one.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>63</course_id><course_title>Learn to Program: The Fundamentals</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>3649</review_data_id><review_date>2013-10-31</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>The course is very easy if you have some programming experience (in other languages) and moderate if you are a beginner. The lectures are top notch. The only problem I had with the course is that you have to complete only 3 programming assignments during the entire course which isn't that much. Would have liked to have at-least a programming assignment for each week. The difficulty of the course is easy. You start from the very beginning and it is less advanced than some of the other programming courses on Coursera (like Interactive Programming on Python from Rice, or Video Game Developing using C# and XNA) and you need to spend less time in this than in other courses. If you don't have any programming experience, this course is definitely for you. If you have some programming experience but you don't know Python, this course will be valuable. If you have knowledge on Python then don't take this course cause this is an introduction level course. After you finish this you will know to write functions, if-else clauses, while and for clauses, to use lists and dictionaries and to read and write from files.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>63</course_id><course_title>Learn to Program: The Fundamentals</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>3647</review_data_id><review_date>2013-10-31</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I have no experience in programming before taking this course.

The instruction was well segmented, well structured, and well delivered, and it convinced me more than any other MOOC I've seen that online, self-guided courses can teach and assess complicated, procedural skills like programming. A particular highlight was the quality of the course's assessments -- they were free of errors and ambiguity, perfectly aligned with what was taught in the lectures, and always just difficult enough to be both fair and challenging. I have some personal experience in writing educational assessments, and I understand how difficult -- but worthwhile! -- it is to strike that balance. As for my own story (for a sense of perspective), I have a wide range of academic interests, and I'd been interested in programming for a long time, but had never had any opportunity to actually learn it. This course took me from being a wannabe hobbyist programmer to an actual hobbyist programmer, which is exactly what I was looking to get out of it. If you're looking for the same, then sign up!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>63</course_id><course_title>Learn to Program: The Fundamentals</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>3639</review_data_id><review_date>2013-10-30</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I used to think that programming was a terribly difficult and unreachable thing before taking this course.

The only programming I had done in the past was intro to HTML and Basic when I was in high school (about 15 years ago). Comparison to other courses: The workload in this class was generally similar to my other classes I've taken except for the last assignment and a couple of the quizzes. Generally, the videos were about the same and most of the quizzes were roughly equivalent to other classes. The workload I specified is an average. The last assignment probably took me closer to 5 or 6 hours on top of the videos that week. I did not receive a statement of accomplishment because I did not keep up with the assignment/exercise deadlines. However, I did go through and do them all for the practice before the final exam and I did score very well on the exam. My scores ranged from about 70% - 100% depending on the quiz/assignment. Likes/dislikes: I liked the in-video quizzes as I found they were excellent at preparing me much better for the exercises and assignments as well as quickly reinforcing and testing my knowledge of the material. My main dislike, if it can be called that, was that some of the material was used slightly differently in the assignments than was shown explicitly in the videos. However, this may have been due to using instructing time efficiently as well as the natural learning curve of learning a new language (in this case, Python). Overall: This course accomplished what it set out to do and I learned a fair amount even though I did not receive a statement of accomplishment (my fault for not being punctual).</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>63</course_id><course_title>Learn to Program: The Fundamentals</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>3632</review_data_id><review_date>2013-10-30</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>I started this class with very little understanding of Python or computer science concepts. I found the progression of material to be well-structured and motivational without overburdening students new to the subject. I do feel that perhaps too much work was done for us on assignments and that I would have gained more appreciation for the well-designed projects if I was having to do more of it. That said, the lecturers were fantastic and repeated important concepts enough that they actually sunk in. Overall this is a highly recommended class for beginners to programming.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>63</course_id><course_title>Learn to Program: The Fundamentals</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>3629</review_data_id><review_date>2013-10-30</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I loved this course: it was my first MOOC experience and it offered everything I felt was needed.

I found it was a great introduction, and it allowed me to apply what I've learned in other programming languages and environments as well. The in-video quizzes were usually quite simple, the homeworks were a bit more challenging, and the assignments enabled me to discover anything I hadn't understood well enough. They were decently challenging, but never so much that I would get frustrated with the problems. The discussion forums were a great resource, especially because some students started posting their complete code after an assignment deadline had passed. This helped me tremendously in finding new ways to tackle a problem as well as finding my own programming style. It does however seem like there were a lot of students enrolled who had some prior programming experience and would therefore post pieces of code that I could not make sense of, even though they usually solved the problem. Overall it was a great experience, the material was very well presented, and all assignments and homeworks were just the right degree of difficulty.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>63</course_id><course_title>Learn to Program: The Fundamentals</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>3497</review_data_id><review_date>2013-10-21</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I had no prior experience with the subject when I started Learn to Program nor had I taken other Coursera courses.

Much of what you will learn will be applicable to computer science in general, Python just so happens to be the learning tool of their choice and it's very good to learn with that because your code will look nice even if you happen to switch to a different programming language like Ruby. You will learn a lot about computer memory and about the call stack. It's all really wonderful stuff, however fundamental it may be, 10/10.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>63</course_id><course_title>Learn to Program: The Fundamentals</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>3484</review_data_id><review_date>2013-10-20</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course is nice and simple, I have rated the Difficulty as Easy but It would vary between Easy and Medium. workload would vary somewhere between 4-8 hrs per week.

Everything is presented in a very concrete fashion, and the instructors have done a superb job of creating quizzes and assignments that test your comprehension and build your understanding. Crucially, when you write code for an assignment and submit it, it is put through a series of tests, not just collected for peer assessment. Therefore, you get immediate and authentic feedback, and can make multiple attempts to improve and refine your programs. I have taken five Coursera courses, and this is by far the most thoughtfully designed for effective online learning.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>63</course_id><course_title>Learn to Program: The Fundamentals</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>3482</review_data_id><review_date>2013-10-20</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Great introductory course.

I had to drop out of most of all of the courses I started last year, due to work commitments, but I really wanted to get the certificate of accomplishment, and it was much easier to complete the second time around. The structure of the course is easy to follow and the submission times are not so strict as other courses, so when "life" gets in the way you can catch up again and not feel under as much pressure to get the exercises and assignments completed by the "soft" deadline- the hard deadline gives a nice amount of "breathing space". I would recommend this course as a MUST for anyone starting programming- and having completed this, then move onto the "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python" from Rice University, as many of the class this year have done... and the MITx: 6.00x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming... but if you're looking at doing either of these, I would recommend that you do this course FIRST!

The length was correct because it fit into my schedule and didn't last so long that work or time off interrupted it.

The workload will vary considerably from my posted 0-2 hours depending on your programming background. I put in about an hour for the videos, plus one for the programs. Personally, I had taken two classes in Python programming so the programs came relatively easily for me (under an hour). This course goes into good depth on many of the basic constructs like variables, program flow, input/output, looping, lists and dictionaries. It does not cover "classes." I took this to improve my speed and get more practice with the more advanced data structures like dictionaries and tuples. If you haven't programmed at all it will be closer to 5-7 as the weeks go on and the programs are getting more difficult. I have taken two other MOOC Python courses including the other coursera Python offering from Joe/Scott/Johnathan on the Rice team for interactive programming and Dave's Python course on Udacity. All have their merits. This one is closer to Dave's as far as complexity goes. The course videos are pretty laser focused on a particular topic and there are enough in-line quizzes to help the student walk through the concepts. They are generally short so it is easy to find the topic if you need to go back (5-10 minutes long) if you get stuck on a quiz or program. The post video quizzes are harder to help cover some of the more critical applications of the topic and are pretty challenging. Most of the program assignments made sense, but in a couple, it seemed like the required functions to build were out of context. They did a great job explaining in the assignments how a programmer needs to get up to speed on requirements and some basics of the domain. However, in a lot of those cases, that knowledge wasn't really so necessary because the instructions essentially told you what to do, and how to do it, as opposed to In many cases to forcing students to apply the domain knowledge they "acquired" in the problem description. Some gripes (but nothing major): Many of the functions even late in the course were one liners with limited logic needed, although you might have needed to generate 10-15 functions. So there could be more rigor there. The Udacity and Interactive Programming (coursera) classes were more challenging in that sense. The autograder (not their fault) could be a bit more helpful when it returns negative feedback. One thing that "might" help students is a video segment that shows how a poorly developed program would trip up the grader and how one interprets the information that it returns. There were tons of students on the forums lamenting the fact they had know idea what was broken and how to fix it. Both teachers are easy to listen to and do a great job explaining subtleties as well as how to use and interpret helpers like the debugger.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>63</course_id><course_title>Learn to Program: The Fundamentals</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>3450</review_data_id><review_date>2013-10-20</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>You learn the basics of Python in a very fun way, with exercises and assignments.

I hope U.Toronto has another session of the follow up course as I think the team has done a good job.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>63</course_id><course_title>Learn to Program: The Fundamentals</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>3434</review_data_id><review_date>2013-10-20</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I had no experience in python but now i know heaps got 98.1% overall results.

It was actually the first course in which I was able to reach to end. I being 15 and having not much knowledge about programming was unable to complete a programming course which I took before it cos it was too difficult for me. LTP: The Fundamentals engages you in such a way that you can easily understand all the materials, video lectures etc. without putting too much stress on your brain. It's problem set is one of the fine features. Problem Sets involves you into real world problems and enables you to solve it in an interesting way. I can write pages in the favour of this course but time is short.

There are many other courses out there, for example in the CodeAcademy, UDACITY and edX. My first experience with Python was on CodeAcademy which is realy nice to go as a TOTAL Beginner, the introduction is realy nice and you get a good instruction on how to think and manipulate Python. At second I found UDACITY as a more elaborate course which takes a lot of recourses and thinking ability. Even it is said that it is a course for beginners and easy. It is a good challenge. As last I found this course on Coursera which was a realy good course because it had the easyness of Codeacademy and the challenging part of UDACITY. As having a small of knowledge of programming it was quite comfortable to follow along the exercises and assingments. So, for a total new person for python, please don't take it as easy as it seams, the first 4 to 5 weeks don't have a hard work load. But the last ones you have to put some effort in. What made me distinguish this course of the others is the implementation of breaking the code in parts as the so called function design recipe where you type as a comment the input values and the output values, the definition of the code and a simple example of what to expect after the code has run. This improves your problem sovling a lot. So for the people to attend this course, whatever your skills are in Python, just dig in!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>63</course_id><course_title>Learn to Program: The Fundamentals</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>3428</review_data_id><review_date>2013-10-20</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course definitely gave a huge boost to my confidence. I've a lot more clarity on Python's concepts, than I previously had. The way topics are broken into smaller, easy-to-understand lessons makes it easy to follow the course. The practice exercises and quizzes are a great way to reinforce the concepts learned. All in all, I'm really happy with this course. Thank you Dr. Jen and Dr. Paul, TA's and the support staff. PS: If you're a newbie to programming and if you wish to learn programming, this is a must-do course IMO.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>63</course_id><course_title>Learn to Program: The Fundamentals</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>3427</review_data_id><review_date>2013-10-20</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>OMG!

The lectures are both monochrome and monotone, and they focus heavily on the mechanics of programming. Unfortunately, they do not capture the thrill of creating new things, nor are you ever given a project of any significance. This class is the equivalent of doing layup drills without ever actually playing a basketball game. I would recommend Udacity's Introduction to CS ahead of this course. That said, this one has a few advantages. For one, it encourages you to use the interactive Python interpreter, which is a very good practice, especially while you're learning. It also introduces and makes use of pythontutor.com, which is very helpful to visualize the execution of a program. Lastly, they put notes in the margin of the video, which are quite helpful as a reference. Because of these strengths, I think this class could make a decent supplement to Udacity's course if you'd like some clarification on the finer points.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>63</course_id><course_title>Learn to Program: The Fundamentals</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>3169</review_data_id><review_date>2013-09-04</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>I bet the previous reviews are from programmers on some other languages, not newbies.... Well, I was a total newbie in programming and really thought this course would get me there, alas! First of all, the instructors voices drove me nuts - esp. the female sounds robotic. Second, the lectures are short and easy (good thing), however, once you start struggling with the excerises of the assignments, you figure out lectures are definitely not enough. The Assignment itself was proposed to be done in a counterintuitive way, so I never got to the point of figuring out what I shall be following the monkey instructions instead of using my own head on a task that is way better tailored to what they were actually lecturing... Very dissappointed.

I'm happy to say that my time was well spent in this regard and after completing the course, I felt I had a solid grounding in Python. While not a beginner myself, I thought the instructors did a great job of explaining what variables are. Their Python Visualizer did a great job of showing how variables point to locations in memory and how the values in these memory locations change as a program executes. I thought this was very useful as a lot of beginners have trouble differentiating variable values from variable references - particularly when passed to a function as an argument. Their function design recipe is a useful technique for writing functions with an emphasis on documenting them before writing any code so that you've fully thought about what you want your function to do before implementing it. The quality of the tuition was excellent. Both instructors explained the concepts in an engaging and easy-to-understand manner. The questions used in the quizzes consolidated and added to what was taught in the classes while the programming assignments presented interesting and enjoyable challenges.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>63</course_id><course_title>Learn to Program: The Fundamentals</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>1488</review_data_id><review_date>2013-05-05</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Before I took part in this course I had completed a few small online courses in this subject field.

I took the course in order to work alongside a friend who decided to learn to program. I wanted to be able to help him if he had trouble, and I've found that, even with my experience, it is hard to help beginners with their courses because it's not always clear what particular nuances the instructors include, and without that knowledge, I can end up just confusing the student. So. That's why a professional programmer might bother to take an intro course. Moving on. What I liked: this course was excellent for the true beginner. It introduces concepts at a pace that is not overwhelming, which is great because the concepts are often overwhelming in and of themselves. What I didn't like: the lecturers were a little monotone in their delivery. To deal with this, I would watch at 1.25x or 1.5x speed. If I missed something it was always easy to rewind a bit to catch what I missed. Overall: the student has a enough time to really dig in an master the basics. The lectures are short and focused, yet they form a cohesive whole. I have recommended this course to several friends who are interested in learning to program.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>63</course_id><course_title>Learn to Program: The Fundamentals</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>1442</review_data_id><review_date>2013-05-03</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>This is a great course for people, who know a thing or two about computers, but never programmed. I do belong here, but for highly inteligent people (like me) it may be too easy. I found the excersises boring and super-easy, mostly because at this level everything can be done by copy-paste. I think the Assignments had too detailed instructions, but from what I saw in the fora, people still had trouble completing them. The lecture videos are short and sometimes I had to play them 3-4 times before I understood what was happening, but short and concise lectures are a merit for MOOCs, where it costs you nothing to replay the video.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>63</course_id><course_title>Learn to Program: The Fundamentals</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>1441</review_data_id><review_date>2013-05-03</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I have taken a number of MOOC computer courses.

My interest in data visualisation made me decide to take this course (apart from the really cool course title). I will never regret my decision as this was my first course with Coursera and my first online course ever. The course was taught with the right mix of faculty lectures, quizzes, reading, videos, mapping assignments and discussions. I've learnt how to map using ArcGIS, which is an industry leading software and have already made a few maps for work as well as for personal decision making. The course made me enrol for four more courses, which I believe is a bit of a stretch with full-time work.

Robinson's lectures were kept short and transcripts were provided for those students who learn better by reading. The discussion forums allowed learning to continue beyond the classroom and these forums not only made me feel like I was apart of a community, but also introduced me to many new things that the course alone could not have done, despite being an awesome course! The instructor provided really interesting related links, along with assigning videos that were a great addition to the course. The mapping assignments were thought provoking and educational, the quizzes were short and to the point, the final exam was well put together, and the peer assessment reflected the aims of the course, along with providing (in advance of doing the assignment) a good rubric for peer assessing. Overall I learned a LOT in this course, despite already being acquainted with this subject in the professional realm. I was introduced to ArcGIS' online environment and creating my own maps, when previously I had only used the desktop version and added to other people's maps. I feel more knowledgeable about spatial thinking and more able to critically analyze maps. I would absolutely recommend this course and this instructor to others.

Thank you all for your hard word and dedication.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>379</course_id><course_title>Maps and the Geospatial Revolution</course_title><school>School:  The Pennsylvania State University</school><review_data_id>33985</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-30</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>It was an amazing course. For everyone who loves geography is a good example how to put your knowledge in practice. This course allows you to gain knowledge and skills not only in GIS but in Geograpy as a science. Dr. Anthony C. Robinson and his team have prepared excellent labs and instructions as well as provide data and resources, so all students can put in practice all of their knowledge. During the discussion in the forum I had opportunity to get familiar with different geographical problems all over the world, what kind of natural disasters exist in particular country, also about the amazinfg food from Easter Asia to Central Africa and more and more. That's my first MOOC but I really enjoyed it. Thank to Mr. Robinson and Coursera team!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>379</course_id><course_title>Maps and the Geospatial Revolution</course_title><school>School:  The Pennsylvania State University</school><review_data_id>3087</review_data_id><review_date>2016-01-01</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I have been working as a free-lance journalist and a magazine board adviser during so many years in France and abroad, I also took a class in computational geography some 15 years ago along with a really passionate team.

The instructor talked clearly and with humor, gave lots of options to watch/read video lectures, gave links to more stuff on the web for those who want and have more time to read. Discussions brought a lot of ideas, considerations, findings - an effect of massiveness. The instructor was involved in the course - participated in forums, wrote announcements. Peer assesment was an interesting exercise. Before the course, I expected that I'll be forced to go out with my GPS receiver and record stuff in the field - I wasn't, but it was an option. It's OK too, just different from what I thought. I found discussion assignment themes in forums to be too weekly organized - I'd liked a subforum per theme (if somebody wants to say about multiple themes, he/she may post to main forum for the discussion). Mapping assignments took a lot of time from me to do. Maybe they could be shorter? It would be good to know required final mapping assignment scope - this one took a lot of time from me too, but I've seen much shorter stories made by peers. Shortcomings were minor and I'm happy I took this course. I'd like to see more introductory courses, in any area, so well organized. The instructor made great job, the provider was good and was not getting in the way of learning process. Thank you, guys!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>379</course_id><course_title>Maps and the Geospatial Revolution</course_title><school>School:  The Pennsylvania State University</school><review_data_id>74649</review_data_id><review_date>2015-05-16</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>I liked the lectures and read through the transcripts just to make sure I didn't miss out on anything. Personally I feel the course could have been completed in 2 - 3 weeks if several topics had not been stretched out so much. Also I thought the mapping assignments were very poorly designed and difficult to do. From an ergonomic and visual POV, they were a pain. I had to keep on flipping between the extremely verbose instructions and the less than appealing GUI of the external map providers (ESRI, ARGCIS, etc). I would have preferred this to have been shown as another video so that I could digest the information in one shot without having to constantly lose focus by shifting from instructions to map and back. Doing problems by oneself is good in Maths but for using a tool, simple spoon-feeding would have been better. To judge if someone really understood how to use those map tools, simple questions could have been included in the weekly quizzes. I feel bad being so negative about this one sore point I have and I would like to thank the course makers for the huge amount of knowledge I gained by going through this course. I completed all quizzes albeit after the hard deadline. Thanks to my OCD I did not skip even those painful mapping assignments :-P !</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>379</course_id><course_title>Maps and the Geospatial Revolution</course_title><school>School:  The Pennsylvania State University</school><review_data_id>74623</review_data_id><review_date>2015-05-14</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>No previous knowledge is required for this course, only to be passionate with maps.

As for the time, in the first 4 weeks I took just about 6-9 hours a week as expected, but in the fifth week I needed more than 20 hours, some of which spent in unsuccessful searches because a lot of data that would be useful not were available. However, this experience was invaluable.

Maps have long been an interest/passion of mine, but not an area where I've ever worked professionally. GIS was something I knew little about. I thoroughly enjoyed the course. The material is well balanced and easy to follow, with a nice mix of reading material, videos, and hands-on mapping practice, mostly using the free ArcGIS software. Dr Robinson is an engaging presenter, with well-paced videos and a nice layer of humour. Most of the assessment during the course is multiple choice quizzes, which are clear and well-structured. You do need to do the hands-on mapping labs each week if you want to score 100% in the quizzes. There is one piece of assessment which involves a practical mapping assignment. I was daunted by this initially but it was pleasing to realise by the end of the course that I had learned enough to do it well. The estimated time commitment of 6-9 hours per week is about right for the first 4 weeks. In the 5th week, when the mapping assignment was due, I probably spent about 20 hours - though this was partly because I became very enthusiastic about my project; I could certainly have done less if I hadn't had the time available. I thoroughly recommend the course. It has definitely whet my appetite for more study in the area.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>379</course_id><course_title>Maps and the Geospatial Revolution</course_title><school>School:  The Pennsylvania State University</school><review_data_id>74435</review_data_id><review_date>2015-05-02</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>It is a nice course.

I admit to using online sources/search engines sometimes when I was taking quizzes without having done the readings. The final exam was a one-time only format that was timed but if you review with information as suggested before starting the exam you can finish the exam with plenty of time to spare. The best part of the course was by far the actual mapping assignments and I learned so much about good mapping practices. The Peer Review assignment was the best part except I'm not sure all of the students followed the directions for how to evaluate the projects.

A really great and fun course for people who have no or just limited experience with GIS and want to really delve into the basics.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>379</course_id><course_title>Maps and the Geospatial Revolution</course_title><school>School:  The Pennsylvania State University</school><review_data_id>3196</review_data_id><review_date>2013-09-10</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>This was an excellent introductory course with good content and presentation. The "mapping labs" that invited students to explore the proprietary software ArcGIS as well as learn how to create and analyze different sorts of basic maps were the meat of the course. There was very little video content, and with the exception of excerpts from a documentary, everything contained in the lecture videos could also be read in a text format (that wasn't just the script of the video, mind you). The content itself was basic but very insightful, going into design and methodology issues such as normalizing population, extrapolation, and selecting appropriate colors that seem obvious but are actually not taken into consideration by many mapmakers such as government agencies. The discussion forums were quite decent, although because there was a graded discussion requirement that made students post at least 20 times in order to get full credit, a lot of shallow and superfluous threads and comments were created. The professor was frequently present in the forums, and he even held an "ask me anything" session for three hours. This course only gets four stars from me, however, because I found it difficult to relate to the mapping labs and to complete the final mapping assignment. Many of the labs relied on datasets from the United States, whereas I live outside the USA and found it difficult to relate to activities like having to map natural disasters or identify unique geological features using datasets that only had information for the USA. This was one of the factors that led me to not complete the final assignment where you created your own map, subject to peer review - if I'm going to use ArcGIS, where am I going to get a dataset? I'm sure I could have worked these issues out with much more time, but perhaps one of my suggestions for a future run of the course is to include a module on sources of data and how to work with datasets.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>379</course_id><course_title>Maps and the Geospatial Revolution</course_title><school>School:  The Pennsylvania State University</school><review_data_id>3166</review_data_id><review_date>2013-09-03</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course really opened up a whole new world to me. The lecturer was engaging and videos were short and snappy, whilst being rich in useful information. I enjoyed the practical components of the course - weekly mapping assignments which built my confidence in using digital mapping tools to tell compelling stories. The discussion board was both lively and friendly, with the lecturer playing a very active role in discussions.

Dr. Robinson was an excellent professor, and leave an enthusiastic bunch of followers. This course shows many tools, including open code based ones, but is focused mainly on ArcGIS. Besides this point, includes basic concepts, definitions, and a lot of work with maps, at the end of each part. Highly commendable, this was one of the more dynamic courses I took with Coursera (this is my eighth MOOC with them), funny and very interesting.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>379</course_id><course_title>Maps and the Geospatial Revolution</course_title><school>School:  The Pennsylvania State University</school><review_data_id>3125</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is the second mooc I've taken and I really enjoyed the class. I had limited prior exposure to the subject, and I found that the structure of the course was well designed. The lessons started with the basics, and it worked its way up the ladder. Each week, it added a level of complexity which culminated in a final map project. The lessons were engaging, the videos and notes were informative, as well as entertaining, and the instructor was available, and responsive on the forums, Facebook, and on Twitter. I highly recommend this class</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>379</course_id><course_title>Maps and the Geospatial Revolution</course_title><school>School:  The Pennsylvania State University</school><review_data_id>3124</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-29</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>I thoroughly enjoyed this course. I have been a stay-at-home-mom for the past 12 years, now planning on going back to work and so I am exploring new career paths. As an exploration geologist I used to work with GIS more than a decade ago and I thought this course would be a good refresher and also a testing ground for my ability to still handle graduate coursework as well as for gauging my interest in the subject. The course surpassed my expectations and gets high marks for being engaging, entertaining, informative, for using cutting edge, accessible technology, and for getting me excited about a new profession - I am actually considering taking the Certificate in GIS offered by Penn State. On the downside, I agree with one of the reviewers that it'd be a good idea to organize the forums with some sort of quality rating. With over 30,000 participants it gets overwhelming reading through them and it also carries the risk of one "getting stuck" and wasting precious time on uninteresting or useless forums. All in all, I highly recommend this course and I commend Dr. Robinson and his team for a job well done.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>379</course_id><course_title>Maps and the Geospatial Revolution</course_title><school>School:  The Pennsylvania State University</school><review_data_id>3121</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I had no experience with this area of study. The course was great. It takes you from knowing nothing to being able to create maps using the ArcGIS website through setting up an account with them. It was better than most Coursera classes I have taken that require you to learn a new software package. What I really like was the amount of new information covered in a very entertaining way. The instructor kept things going at just the right pace. I would highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to know more about how to understand and use geographical data.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>379</course_id><course_title>Maps and the Geospatial Revolution</course_title><school>School:  The Pennsylvania State University</school><review_data_id>3108</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-28</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>My previous experience with geography was only at school level, limited by the few years in which it was taught and the scarce importance assigned.In this course, the matter was valued and made fascinating. Compared to the other two courses I attended, this was surely the most practical and funny. It trained also on how to do things, not only on what the things are. I appreciated the several references and resources provided about maps, layers, data and learning opportunities. I will strive to complete the map design process, including the thematic maps, which could result useful for my current job. Further, I am very interested in Voluntereed Geographic Info activity. Last, a sincere thank to Prof. Robinson and his team for the care and the enthusiasm displayed in this course</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>379</course_id><course_title>Maps and the Geospatial Revolution</course_title><school>School:  The Pennsylvania State University</school><review_data_id>3107</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-28</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>FIRST: This is by far and away the best online course I have taken covering any subject. If you are interested in an introduction to GIS and mapping you should consider this course. SECOND: Please be mindful that this is an introductory course and is geared specifically for students with limited or no prior mapping experience. With that said: This course does an excellent job of providing the student a solid foundation to build from without becoming overwhelming to those with little or no prior exposure to the subject. The instructor provides the information in a clear and relevant format with a good bit of humor as well. Course learning structure includes: short video lectures, short reading assignments, quizzes, discussion assignments, mapping assignments, final exam, final mapping project, peer review and survey. Overall, a fantastic intro course delivered in a fun and engaging format by an outstanding instructor.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>379</course_id><course_title>Maps and the Geospatial Revolution</course_title><school>School:  The Pennsylvania State University</school><review_data_id>3097</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-28</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I recommend this course if you are interested in maps, geography, cartography and the science behind it. I am an architect from Spain so I had experience working with maps, but mostly in an "analogic" pencil-to-paper way. I learned in this map how the tools I use everyday related to maps are working, in depth and in a fun way. This was my first coursera, but I could see the classes were very well done, the lectures are concise and funny, and in general the class was very organized, and effective! What I liked most was doing maps and sharing them with my peers, so we could talk about what we think and how things work from different points of view. The downside were, to me, some technical issues with the login proccess in esri and some ArcGIS problems sharing maps publicly. Anyway this were minor problems, and they did not occur to all students. I loved this course, and I know it will return on March 2014. I will probably follow Anthony C. Robinson in any other course he makes. See you there!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>379</course_id><course_title>Maps and the Geospatial Revolution</course_title><school>School:  The Pennsylvania State University</school><review_data_id>3095</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-28</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>In my activity (computer technician) I randomly get in touch with GIS related activities. I'm curious, so I like always to study things in order to understand better their use, but most of all I'm interested in new point of views and new procedures that (maybe) could be used in different contexts. That's why I enrolled and really appreciated this course: it gives an overall idea, stimulating neurons in (spatially ;-) new directions and willing me to learn more. The course exactly met my expectations, it forced me at the beginning to confront with the other students (oh, btw, it makes feel younger being tagged as a student: I'm a kid 49 years old :-) and I learned and discovered several new things. I really appreciated the peer assessment, it was something new to me but I recognize it's a really good way to go. In conclusion: thanks Dr. Antony C. Robinson and thanks to all the peers and People with whom I interacted during this course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>379</course_id><course_title>Maps and the Geospatial Revolution</course_title><school>School:  The Pennsylvania State University</school><review_data_id>3094</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-28</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>As an introductory course, it did exactly what it proposed to do. Liked the approach and the way all issues were handled. The materials were of good quality and a very good variety of hi and low tech options were provided for a range of participants - I.e. it really was inclusive. Thought the requirements a little tough - especially over the (northern hemisphere) vacation time and deadlines were deadlines .... would have liked more flexibility to get ahead in order to prioritise other things. More meaningful discussion was missing from many of the fora, quality rather than quantity would have been better - a suggestion for future courses. I would certainly recommend this course for beginners. Was amazing the range of people involved. But as with most MOOCs, it did not appear to reach those who perhaps would need it most. Coursers seems a good and reliable platform. Using ArcGIS Online for lab work was great as it is FREE! I know there are open source options, but it unified all participants and allowed support to be provided. Id like to take a more advanced course now that got into story maps and template customisation! The amount of work needed to develop such a course should not be underestimated. So hats off to those responsible.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>379</course_id><course_title>Maps and the Geospatial Revolution</course_title><school>School:  The Pennsylvania State University</school><review_data_id>3092</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-28</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>Having worked on the subject for a couple of years now, there is very little new I took from the course. It relies on proprietary software (ArcGIS) instead of the many open source solutions, mainly due to its web availability, but I found that to be a down side.

I didn't have any geospatial bases, and I have been able to create basic maps with professional tools in few weeks. I believe maps&amp;geospatial; is a revolution that has just changed our world, and I consider there is are no limits for future applications (and the evolution of technologies and low cost equipment give all of us maps&amp;geospatial; capabilities). Don’t forget that it’s a true science, and that behind the “user-end simple use we have” there are tons of skilled people’s work. Well, I have easily learnt a lot of interesting things and I’m gonna apply them in my everyday life. More, I have had fun.

It's a very 'hands-on' course. Basic principles are taught in the lectures (which are brief), but the real learning comes from the mapping exercises. I noted that the 'workload' was 8-11 hours per week, but that's might be over- stating what was required in the course. I probably spent that much and more because I wanted to 'mess with maps.' I am sure I will continue to do so on my own even now that the course has ended.

Despite the brevity, there was a lot of information packed in and reinforced by weekly mapping and video assignments. The top achievement is working on our final maps and learning through doing, even if it didn't always work out as we intended.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>379</course_id><course_title>Maps and the Geospatial Revolution</course_title><school>School:  The Pennsylvania State University</school><review_data_id>3053</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is the first review I've written after doing 7 MOOCs because I only like to commit my opinion to writing if it's positive. Anthony's GIS course is a beacon standing out, leading the way for other courses - this is how it should be done. It's engaging, reasonably rigorous, well-judged to appeal to educated beginners and best of all, it forces you to engage with the subject. You can't put his lectures on double speed or skip the assignments as you can on some MOOCs. Congratulations on this course - quite outstanding!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>379</course_id><course_title>Maps and the Geospatial Revolution</course_title><school>School:  The Pennsylvania State University</school><review_data_id>3050</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I had no experience in maps before this class. I am pleased to say that I not only learned a ton about maps and the work that goes into them, but am now genuinley interested in the process. Dr. Anthony Robinson is made to teach online. His structure for the class was a perfect mix of independent work and videos. The few video lectures he made were very short and to the point, making it easy to dive in and not get bored. He also provided videos and links for further engagement. I will take any class he offers in the future because he was that good! Keep up the great work!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>379</course_id><course_title>Maps and the Geospatial Revolution</course_title><school>School:  The Pennsylvania State University</school><review_data_id>3049</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This was a great class. At the moment I am majoring in geography, so I knew most of the material already. Despite this fact, I wanted to take this course to see how such concepts could be taught via an online class. Having completed the course, I am impressed at the holistic approach Dr. Robinson used to teach these important concepts in geography. He was able to clearly explain the material while also using straighforward examples to get the point across. With this approach, Robinson showcases his strengths as an instructor. I am jealous that geography students at Penn State get to take classes with him. I would love to take a coourse with him. All in all, this was a successful class and I hope Dr. Robinson makes more classes in the future.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>379</course_id><course_title>Maps and the Geospatial Revolution</course_title><school>School:  The Pennsylvania State University</school><review_data_id>3044</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-24</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I thoroughly enjoyed this course and everything I learned regarding mapping and this geospatial revolution.

Initially what makes it good is (a) the sheer "wow, I didn't know that maps could do this"-ness of all the technology, (b) part of your final mark is determined by your contribution to the discussion forums and so there is a lot of discussion, some of it a bit coerced perhaps but some quite interesting, (c) the high level of engagement of the lecturer. The down-side of this last is that he is a bit too eager to please everyone and so sacrifices some academic rigour. But he himself says that this course is a starter drug intended to draw you in to GIS and it does.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>379</course_id><course_title>Maps and the Geospatial Revolution</course_title><school>School:  The Pennsylvania State University</school><review_data_id>3039</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-23</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This was my first Coursera class and I have no prior experience with GIS.

Assignments were well thought out and the professor's style was extremely engaging. I would have preferred the use of open source mapping software but I understand why the decision to use ESRI was made and it makes sense in the context of this course. Overall, a really nice, succinct introduction to cartography and GIS. My only caveat--but not really a negative given that the course was wholly consistent with its description--is that this is a very basic intro to the subject. If you know anything to speak of about the subject matter you'll probably learn a few things and find stuff of interest (at least I did), but it felt more like a fun diversion for a few hours a week than a full-fledged course that really enhanced my understanding of the topic. As I say, not a negative, but set your expectations realistically.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>379</course_id><course_title>Maps and the Geospatial Revolution</course_title><school>School:  The Pennsylvania State University</school><review_data_id>2995</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-20</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Sorry, I don't know any way for to drive an Audi RS4 Avant or RS6 Avant, my car has twenty years old and continues....

I found the course very interesting and informative. Course material and videos are very well designed and clear, easy to understand. For beginners its very useful. Course structure is very nice. Before joining this course I had some idea of application of GIS in forestry. I am using it for planning Forest Management and preparation of working plans. After attending this course I think GIS can be used in many ways in forestry and Wild life management. It can be applied in every field of study and planning for development in every field. In near future it will be used in mapping of resource, encroachment etc. I believe it can be used for integrated development.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>379</course_id><course_title>Maps and the Geospatial Revolution</course_title><school>School:  The Pennsylvania State University</school><review_data_id>2982</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course objectives are met indeed.

Now confirmed as I enter the third lesson of this course. The amount of information presented is extraordinary and of high quality. This is my first online course of any depth so I have spent some time acclimating myself to this culture. Contributing to the forums in a meaningful way took some time getting used to. However, the requirement to engage classmates in this way is so rewarding. Expansion of sources of information and knowledge through sharing is incredible. Finally, considering that the class new exceeds 30K students, Anthony and the staff do an incredible job of monitoring the class and tweaking as needed, sampling the online responses and posting of classwork. I'm now almost addicted to this subject. P.S. For me, this course show-cased social media in ways I never anticipated. Up to now I have been leery in using social media because of security issues and amount of useless information shared by so many people. Now I see the value in clusters of people with a common interest or purpose. Seeing it visually on maps has great impact. All finished for now, but I definitely will be mapping more then ever.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>103</course_id><course_title>Functional Programming Principles in Scala</course_title><school>School:  École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne</school><review_data_id>51</review_data_id><review_date>2013-01-09</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Wikipedia has a very short and humble article about the instructor: "He designed the Scala programming language and Generic Java". It was enough for me to sign up the day the course was announced. Prerequisites: any programming language and some basic knowledge of Java. I'm not a professional Java programmer myself but I don't feel I miss something. Video Lectures: part of it are static slides, the other part is live stream from Eclipse. Programming assignments: not so hard but they usually have several different solutions so sometimes it's a good idea to go to the forums and check for hints What I've learned currently from the course: \- Tail recursion - brilliant idea \- Thinking in functions - now I think of a normal variable as a function who's body is return statement. \- Many things that I'm usually do by foreaching can be solved in functional style in one or two lines. \- Definitely blows the mind if you haven't had experience with functional languages earlier. \- Very interesting how you can solve Bloxorz game in FP style.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>103</course_id><course_title>Functional Programming Principles in Scala</course_title><school>School:  École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne</school><review_data_id>1290</review_data_id><review_date>2013-10-07</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I'm still doing the course and may update the review but I thought I'd discuss my current experience. Overall I'd recommend the course. Its a good introduction to Scala, has some interesting coverage of functional programming, and is generally quite enjoyable. My only gripe is it doesn't have as much in depth coverage of functional programming as I'd have liked. The assignments do force you to think of how to decompose, analyse, visualise and test functional solutions but there isn't actually much coverage of those aspects in the videos. This seemed to be a common complain in the forums too so I don't think it was just me. Other than that though its great.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>103</course_id><course_title>Functional Programming Principles in Scala</course_title><school>School:  École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne</school><review_data_id>555</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-07</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Absolutely phenomenal course. It taught me the fun, conciseness, and promise of functional programming through learning the Scala language. Scala is very interesting in that it is a fusion of functional and object-oriented programming paradigms. So you can define your own types and classes as in Java, but you can write these in a functional, elegant, and very concise way (many functions in the course are only 1 or 2 lines -- sometimes very hard- earned, however!). Anyone interested should see Martin Odersky's YouTube talk "Working Hard to Keep It Simple." Martin Odersky is a very effective teacher, extremely knowledgeable (not only invented Scala but wrote the most recent Java compiler) and most importantly is very "into" this field. His love of the subject is inspiring to me. Highlights of the course: very good programming assignments, which were creative, non-trivial and really showcased what Scala does well; Scala worksheet; combinatorial search, pattern-matching, and built- in functional programming functions like map, filter, fold, anonymous functions, and for-expressions (as opposed to for-loops) are all great to work with. Streams blew my mind. Good automated grading and feedback system. The course left me with the impression that not only can Scala be used in the real world (after the initial steep learning curve, that is) but also it is such a great teaching tool. I learned so much about programming and how low-level frankly a lot of programming in Java is in an undergrad CS curriculum. I think CS students could really benefit from learning Scala. Highly recommended!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>103</course_id><course_title>Functional Programming Principles in Scala</course_title><school>School:  École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne</school><review_data_id>518</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-01</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Prior experience in the field: Tried to learn haskell. Didn't do too well. Like: There were no pointless quizzes, only programming assignments. The programming assignments were very interesting and challenging [the discussion forums helped]. The lectures had assignments in them, with solutions (so that you can see Martin Odersky's approach). Being taught by the inventor of the language meant the language was concisely yet (almost) completely covered. Functional programming is a very exciting paradigm. There was a "cheat sheet" and an "Assignment feedback" section that helped underline and rectify some common errors in students' code. The programming assignment checker was very thorough. The course was very well rounded - as an example, we learned about test suites as well! Dislike: Felt some of the lectures could have been spruced up/made shorter. Suggested improvements: Provide official solutions for the assignments. Overall: Martin Odersky gets you up to speed with Scala and functional programming really fast with this short course. It is demanding, but if you have even the slightest interest in functional programming (or want to learn it), a MUST take.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>103</course_id><course_title>Functional Programming Principles in Scala</course_title><school>School:  École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne</school><review_data_id>1610</review_data_id><review_date>2013-05-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This was an excellent introductory course in functional programming. It also served as a great introduction to the Scala language - taught by no less than the language's creator. Awesome! It isn't, and doesn't purport to be, a general introduction to programming. You should have a little experience programming before tackling this course, though by no means do you need to be an intermediate programmer, much less an expert. The grade is determined solely from the programming exercises. The exercises themselves are quite easy, but encourage you to think in the "functional style," which, coupled with the unfamiliarity of the Scala language, may make them initially a bit more challenging until you get comfortable with the idioms and syntax. For experienced developers, even those with limited functional language knowledge, it likely won't require more than 2-4 hours/week, particularly if you view the videos at double speed... but please slow down if you're not absorbing all the concepts - there are some great ideas presented, and they provide a large part of the value of taking the course! For novice programmers, it may require a bit more time to complete the programming exercises - the forums can provide assistance in this regard. In particular, I'd emphasize to those new to programming that they should take Professor Odersky's recommendation and read the book "The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs." Some of the exercises are adapted from this classic text, and it can provide a richer understanding of the course material than the videos alone.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>103</course_id><course_title>Functional Programming Principles in Scala</course_title><school>School:  École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne</school><review_data_id>1335</review_data_id><review_date>2013-09-03</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Very good course. This is the first course I took on coursera connected to computer science which doesn't use standard coursera's quizzes. Instead it evaluates your code by tests, and checking style rules. It works very good. There are no quizzes nor exam about lectures, only programming assignments. Assignments themselves are good planned. They help show both basic language features, and basics of fuctional programming. They start from very easy level, and gradually the difficulty rises. It shouldn't be too difficult to get passing grade, but you need some work to get best mark. Discussion forum, and course help is organized nicely. Staff is responsive to feedback of students. The weakest point of course are the lectures. They aren't bad, but their pacing could be a little faster (watching at higher speed helps), and I think that some (not that difficult) topics were explained too deeply. Because of lectures I can't give full 5 star rating, but it's really close. Just be sure that you pass per-requirements of course, since it is assumed that you have some experience in programming.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>103</course_id><course_title>Functional Programming Principles in Scala</course_title><school>School:  École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne</school><review_data_id>201</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>It is a universal truth that you have to work hard to keep things simple and this is reflected in both this course and the programming language Scala.

In this course Martin Odersky show off the functional elements of Scala. If you want to learn functional programming then " Introduction to systematic program design - part 1" is much better. If you want to lean Scala  the this course is not extensive enough. If you are wondering how the functional paradigm is expressed in Scala then this course is the answer. The programming assignment was quiet easy when you have the systematic program design course. All in All I didn't learn much in this course something got clarified and I got to see another language. The course is okay made and a more junior programmer might find it useful.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>103</course_id><course_title>Functional Programming Principles in Scala</course_title><school>School:  École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne</school><review_data_id>7522</review_data_id><review_date>2014-04-05</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I am a software developer with a lot of experience with Java, C, C++, assembly but little with functional programming. I have started about 12 online courses on Coursera, edX and Udacity and completed 8 of them. I have to say that the scala course is the best I followed. Prof. Martin Odersky is may be not the best teacher I met, compared to Walter Lewin at MIT or Jim Fowler at Ohio State University, but the functional programming is a delightful subject and the assignments are fantastic. The course is moderately difficult if you have experience in Object Oriented Programming et probably very easy if you have functional programming experience.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>103</course_id><course_title>Functional Programming Principles in Scala</course_title><school>School:  École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne</school><review_data_id>7499</review_data_id><review_date>2014-04-03</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Very good and complete course about Scala taught by its creator, which adds value to it.

I had some background in Functional Programming as a hobbyist - I got so far as writing a Minesweeper clone in Haskell once - but no experience with Scala. I was impressed with how easily the functional concepts merged with the OO-concepts from Java in Scala, and I think I gained new appreciation of both. The course was hard, though. If I hadn't heard about FP at all, I doubt I would have managed to complete it, and you would absolutely need confidence doing programming exercises. The deadlines were reasonably generous for Coursera, but still it got tight towards the end. There are no comparable courses on Coursera or any other site that I know of, but I would definitively take a followup course if Odersky made one.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>103</course_id><course_title>Functional Programming Principles in Scala</course_title><school>School:  École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne</school><review_data_id>1504</review_data_id><review_date>2013-05-09</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Very good introduction to functional programming using Scala.

The assignments are clear but challenging, and you're provided with unit tests, so you'll know whether your code works before you submit it. The assignments for the last two weeks are rather time-consuming. My only complaint about this class is that the Scala plugin for Eclipse, which you are required to use, was a bit buggy, but perhaps they've ironed out these issues since I took the class in the Fall of 2012.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>103</course_id><course_title>Functional Programming Principles in Scala</course_title><school>School:  École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne</school><review_data_id>1093</review_data_id><review_date>2013-03-06</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is a brilliant course. Scala is a very terse language that borrows from a number of other languages and runs on the JVM. Scala is written to support programming in both imperative and functional style. The course emphasizes Sacla's functional programming features. Functional programming differs from other styles of programming in that programs don't maintain "state" - the use of traditional programming constructs like variables, iteration and mutable data are discouraged. Instead, all functions are "first class objects" and can be passed as parameters to other functions. Programs become recursive, stateless function calls. This takes some getting used to for an old Java guy like myself. It is fascinating and a little frustrating to look at the world in a new way. I can well imagine that functional-style programs might be better for many classes of problems than imperative-style approaches (OO in particular). But the real draw for me was just the excitement of looking at very familiar tasks in the light of very unfamiliar techniques. I was expecting to learn about Scala. It turns out that Scala is not so difficult. I really learned about FP. If Dan Grossman's Coursera course on Programming languages had been available, it would have been helpful to take that first, although both courses stand alone, and functional programming is a large enough subject that more than one course is not excessive. I loved the course and can't recommend it highly enough. You ought to be an experienced programmer or expect to have to work very hard to keep up.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>103</course_id><course_title>Functional Programming Principles in Scala</course_title><school>School:  École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne</school><review_data_id>936</review_data_id><review_date>2013-02-12</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>This course was a great way to learn Scala.

Even for someone with extensive experience in functional programming, it was very interesting to see what Odersky (the father of Scala) thought it was worth emphasizing. For instance, he thought it was worth spending a significant chunk of time talking about call-by-name vs. call-by-value at the very beginning of the class, even though the first couple videos were only a total of half an hour long. I could go on for pages about what he emphasized, but if you're curious, why not just see for yourself? There were some downsides to the course, though. First, the course seems more like a video of some parts of a regular classroom course, as opposed to something like the Udacity courses, which are clearly designed from the ground up to be online courses. Secondly, some of the homework used information that wasn't covered in the class. If you look at the forums for the class, you can see people with less theoretical background struggling with some of the assignments, and none of the background was listed in the pre-requisites for the course. Third, the grading criteria for passing the course wasn't released until after the last assignment had been released. It turned out you only needed 60%, which was trivial, given how the course was run (no quizzes, only programming assignments, and the assignments were very generously graded; you could get 60% on most of the assignments by passing the unit tests for the trivial helper functions for the assignment and not even doing the bulk of the work). You might say that my third complaint obviates my second complaint, but you wouldn't get much out of the course if you only did that, and there was no way to no you'd pass if you did that until you'd already done all the assignments. That being said, I liked the course, and I'm planning on taking the follow-up course that's being planned.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>103</course_id><course_title>Functional Programming Principles in Scala</course_title><school>School:  École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne</school><review_data_id>351</review_data_id><review_date>2012-11-08</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>One of the best courses in coursera.

Let me explain: the course is absolutely beautiful, and the professor is brilliant - I might even say he's a genius. But... I felt again and again that all this beauty is just art for the sake of the art - and that the aspects related to "programming as a craft" were (maybe deliberately) ignored... In a nutshell - the course convinced me NOT to use Scala as a language of choice for any practical projects: yes, it is truly beautiful, and this in a manner only the greatest works of art can be - but this is very far from the "industrial strength", languages which will be used not only by the best and the brightest, but also by armies of average programmers. Maybe the efforts of the language' promoters (in courses like these) should be directed towards showing how Scala (and Akka, and Play) can be used EASILY, and IN A PRODUCTIVE MANNER, to develop large scale projects. But maybe it's just me...</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>103</course_id><course_title>Functional Programming Principles in Scala</course_title><school>School:  École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne</school><review_data_id>232</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-28</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>This course has introduced me to the awesome world of functional programming.

I liked the idea of a course about thinking. I didn't want to absorb and then regurgitate information. I wanted to improve the way my brain performs. The first couple of lectures were reassuring. I was able to complete the homework (which was voluntary but is the real key to learning in this class). I understood the concepts explained in the lecture, and I did well on the multiple-choice quizzes. Everything was fantastic. The next few lectures were a bit of a jungle. I felt like I understood the lectures, except I had to play the video twice in some spots, and when I tackled the homework I'd initially complete maybe half of the answers. Then I'd watch the videos again, or use an answer from one question to help me figure out how to answer another question. When I ultimately finished the homework assignments, I felt triumph. I could feel myself learning. This was why I was taking MOOCs! The next few lectures were a struggle. The course was getting harder, and people were dropping out. I started to see forum posts like, "Thank you for the class, see you next time." But I'd put in too much time and effort. We were getting deep into proof mechanics, which had bedeviled me since high school, and I wanted to learn this. I struggled through the homework and couldn't answer all of the questions, but I was able to succeed in the class from a scoring perspective, primarily because of the multiple-choice nature of the quizzes. I understood which proofs were and weren't valid -- a victory in itself. My brain was twisting itself in new ways, uncomfortably, like a traveling salesman who mistakenly joined Cirque du Soleil. Then came the final exam. It was peer graded and entirely focused on doing proofs from scratch. It was also a quantum leap from the multiple-choice quizzes I'd been completing, and from the homework I'd been struggling through and sort-of completing. I was in trouble. I considered trying to bs some answers. I decided that this would be pointless and would serve no one. No one was judging me here, except myself. It would take me at least 40 to 60 hours to struggle through this exam, and I did not have 40 to 60 hours available. I didn't turn in the exam. I decided that I could take the class again later, and get to the next layer of proof mastery then. I had already transformed the way my brain worked, and that was my goal all along. I mentally said farewell to my certificate of completion. Then I received one. With distinction. It seems my performance on the quizzes outweighed my non-performance on the exam. I was surprised and extremely happy, but I also felt that I wanted to return and try harder, certificate or no. It's almost like there should be two levels of this class: Level 1, the fundamentals, which I completed, and Level 2, the proof mastery, which in all fairness I did not (although I did learn how to analyze proofs). Regardless, I think this is one of the most useful, real-world applicable courses on Coursera or the entire Internet, and I would recommend it to anyone. I'm no longer afraid of a jumble of math symbols when I see them on a page. I can dive in, sort out the meaning, and understand the point the author is trying to make. Which is amazing.

In other words, he wasn't consistent with his usage. He tries to gives examples, be clear, and break things down, but then at other times he doesn't (or if he is, he isn't doing it very well). This inconsistency lost me more than a few times. I had to rewind several videos to try and untangle what he was trying to say, what assumptions he was making, etc. The most difficult sections I found to be the middle lectures about proofs. For example, at one time he said that there aren't exact 'proof' formulas you can use, but then later will say "and since I am using so-and-so type of proof, I need to do this." Things like this just compound. He could do a much better job at first outlining the various proof types, moving more in depth into the structure(s) of each, then finally broadening each type of proof. Another annoying part is that the week's lectures are only released half-way through the week with the assignment due less than a week later. It gives a shortened time to study and can be a problem for the many different schedules that people have. He should release all the material at the beginning of the week or extend the assignment due dates. Also, people can make their own decisions about how to study once the material is out, the professor shouldn't be making these decisions for them. The course is admirable in scope, but there are still a lot of problems. It's like a snake eating its own tail with all the pedagogy ideas their trying to implement. Because of this, the course could have been a medium difficulty, but turns unnecessarily into a hard one. However, the course did have one of the best Certificate of Completions, describing in great detail what we studied in the course. I'd like to contrast this to other courses, which often give a vague description on the Certificate of Completion and usually not useful if you want to present it to other people so they can see what you did in the course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>108</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Mathematical Thinking</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>29829</review_data_id><review_date>2014-04-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course has been an amazing journey for me. This course first caught my eye in September 2012. I enrolled in this course out of curiosity but to my amazement, I found this course very challenging but at the same time very interesting as well. I remember being very confused at the sight of the lectures. So I decided to unenroll and take the next iteration, when I had better knowledge. So I decided to take the next iteration, that came in September 2013, at my own pace because I wanted to take this course pressure- free. So that the material could really sink in better before I take this course for real. I watched all the lectures and attempted all the quizzes. The only things I didn't do were the assignments and the test-flight because that required a live course with active forums. I was really surprised at the intricacy of this course. So finally the day came, February 3rd 2014, the day when I was going to start this course for real. After watching the lectures and attempting the quizzes, I realized that my understanding had already begun to improve. The real turning point came when I started attempting my assignments and posting them on the forum. Each week, there was a set of problems given to us. We were recommended and encouraged to attempt these questions and discuss it with your peers. When I looked at the solutions of other people, I realized how to make my solution better. The main goal of the course is to make the student see mathematics in a different way. Not only as a tool for calculation but as a universal language which polishes your understanding. After mastering this language, the student is able to solve problems efficiently and formulate thinking process which helps them in this course. Moreover with the help of mathematics we can understand the problems better by visualizing an image of the problem and translating the problem into a mathematical statement. This is the first and most important step to gain success in this course. In my opinion there were many plus points in this course, which made it unique and one of the best: For me, this course needs your active participation in the forums if you are a beginner. Healthy debate is encouraged by the professor and the exchange of ideas is essential. This course may be hard at first but taking it twice and discussing your problems on the forums will make you sail through this course. The other important and striking factor of this course was the non-stop, passionate interaction of the professor in the forums. He made sure to comment on as many threads and posts as possible, encouraging his students and discussing problems. He encouraged group activities but at the same time he also encouraged good working ethics. He discouraged unnecessary competitiveness and told the students to focus only on the point of this course, learning. For him, learning is the crux of this course. He once wrote: "The course is in no way set up as putting anyone in competition with anyone else. I think this is a big plus of free, open MOOCs." In my point of view, this thinking brings out the best in every student. In his course every student was actively helping their fellow peers. This course really lays the foundation of mathematical thinking. I have one suggestion though: Please make a sequel for this course because this course deserves one. There are still many things we have yet to explore. For the people who want to take this course, you may find this course hard at first but with the help of your peers and the wonderful lectures, you will be able to sail through. This course is for the people who are not afraid to try. "It's just like riding a bicycle, at first you will keep falling but then one day you will find out that you can ride and you will wonder why it seemed so hard at first." --Keith Devlin.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>108</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Mathematical Thinking</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>1632</review_data_id><review_date>2013-05-19</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>This was a challenging course mostly focused on clear mathematical thinking and notation with a fair emphasis on proofs. Overall, Professor Devlin is highly creative in his approach to this conceptually challenging course. Even though I have taken many more practical mathematically oriented courses such as calculus, differential equations, linear systems, etc, they did not help much in this course, because the emphasis is more on methodology than actually getting a correct answer. While I generally struggled for much of the course, I was elated when I was actually able to put many of the concepts together to achieve a reasonably high score on the final exam. Overall, this is a valuable course, especially for those who are beginning their careers in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>108</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Mathematical Thinking</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>1047</review_data_id><review_date>2013-03-04</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Unlike many courses which focus on learning about or thinking about a subject, this course focussed on changing the way you think - literally 'changing your mind'. This is a very difficult task! This new set of reasoning tools is an important skill set in the modern world. Professor Devlin himself did a lot of thinking about how this could work in an online program (see http://mooctalk.org/) for his first iteration of the course. I enjoyed the lectures, the quizes, the exercises and the requirement to create and peer- review proofs. Not easy, but very worthwhile. Professor Devlin has thoroughly thought through the minor problems encountered in the first iteration and the changes he is implementing for the 2nd round address those issues.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>108</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Mathematical Thinking</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>1024</review_data_id><review_date>2013-03-03</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This was one of my first MOOCs and therefore not only a great introduction to Mathematical Thinking but also to this new way of online education.

It had been over 40 years since I had taken a math class, and although I earned a teaching certificate with a math minor, I didn't learn to think mathematically. I wanted to learn how to think and write proofs. A great learning experience comes with a price, however, and that price included frustration as I wrestled with topics I hadn't learned previously, and problem set scores that got lower every week. The lectures are stimulating and clear, and Dr. Devlin has a unique teaching style and ability to connect with students through video. When I sat down to write the final exam, I was surprised and excited to find that somewhere among the frustration and discouragement I had actually gained the ability to write a mathematical proof! As Dr. Devlin says, it's like learning to ride a bike. It seems like you aren't making much progress, and then, suddenly, you can do it! Thank you, Dr. Devlin for a great course!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>108</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Mathematical Thinking</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>3830</review_data_id><review_date>2013-11-14</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course requires High School maths skill and commitment. The journey starts with Logical Statements and ends with Real analysis. In a way it traces the key developments in Mathematics in the last few centuries and reads like the "Modern History of Mathematics". Along the way you are encouraged to ponder over maths problems and learn to think like a Mathematician. Just felt the last part of the course can be better spaced as the concepts are a bit arcane.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>108</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Mathematical Thinking</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>3747</review_data_id><review_date>2013-11-09</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I'm a software developer who studied discrete maths and semantics at university so I am not within the stated demographic of this course. I signed up because the reviews were great and I admired Professor Devlin's commitment to the pedagogical side of it, and also because the course's promotional material indicated that this course would address the huge difference in mindset between high school maths and university maths, and I was curious what that was since I didn't remember it (In retrospect I think this may be a US/UK concept and some other countries like New Zealand where I'm from must be doing better with a gradual transition on this front). I almost quit in the first couple of weeks as it became clear I was familiar with the material already, but then I read one of Professor Devlin's blog posts where he says that if the first week or so seems easy, it's only because you are not connecting with the material on the right level, and you will find yourself lost by the middle of the course. Well that sounded like a challenge! So I stuck with it. In the last week or so with real analysis, there was some material that was new to me. Proof grading against a course rubric was the major component of this course (more so than in previous iterations), and I have to say that I found this a very frustrating experience (and not in the good way which is ultimately rewarding). The professor's grading often seemed fickle, docking points from a very clear proof for lack of clarity and reasons one moment and giving full marks to something very terse the next. I'm sure there were (mostly) good reasons for his choices, but they were not communicated in a way that allowed me to calibrate effectively. I ended up bombing on the practice exam gradings, even though my own exam got a good grade. This course is obviously very rewarding to many people so I gave it a good grade despite my own mixed experience. But for my money, for people with a solid maths background, I would recommend Calculus: Single Variable by Robert Ghrist over this course. It was more difficult and more fun.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>108</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Mathematical Thinking</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>3746</review_data_id><review_date>2013-11-09</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I was used to applying given formulas to solve problems .

Professor Devlin wanted to make the experience "like he was sitting next to you looking at a proof together". It doesn't really work very well on Coursera. Some lecturers leave long pauses in their lectures........... and Professor Devlin is one of them. Long pauses make lots of sense in a physical lecture as it leaves time for thinking. Here's the thing though: Coursera has a pause button. If I have a "Woah!" moment, I'll hit pause or rewind. Of course, I could watch these lectures on high speed, but I don't want the words to be faster - I just want less ......... - not more............. - less................ redundancy .................... and verbal................ whitespace.................. OK.................... what's.................... next.............? It's not just the pauses either. Professor Devlin doesn't seem relaxed in front of a camera. There's a fixed smile that never seems to make it to the eyes making me feel that he's finding it all a bit dull too - like he's having to make small-talk at a party his missus has dragged him to. The assignments aren't terribly interesting either. In the last couple of weeks you're asked to submit proofs for given propositions which are peer reviewed. At least that's something different. Professor Devlin does talk about the challenges of working with MOOCs in supplementary videos. I just don't think his team found the right solution to these challenges. Perhaps they should look at how others have tackled this problem? It's not a bad course though. It's useful stuff and the delivery probably works really well in the physical world - it just feels pretty clunky for Coursera.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>108</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Mathematical Thinking</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>101</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-21</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Very good lectures.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>108</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Mathematical Thinking</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>24</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-09</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>A wonderful course!

The last section of the class is for math majors, but the first and middle parts are almost pure logic with a math slant and is appropriate for anyone. The style is inquiry based learning (IBL), so it isn't typical of most online classes. IBL is great if you are used to asking a lot of questions and doing a lot of self learning (which I am), but I don't think IBL is well suited for a MOOC since it requires the students to seek a lot of feedback and there are very few TA to give quality feedback and the study groups can be hit or miss depending on whether you are in a group where someone(s) understands the material or not. I found the instructor annoying more because the many times he repeated things and the superfluous chitchat on the lectures than his teaching. The video time could have been cut by half if he cut out all that stuff, and quite frankly, it made it a pain to go back and watch lectures for content. To be honest, I learned more from his (very concise) book than I did from the videos. He is not a natural teacher, so the concepts could be more clearly presented. (My high school logic class was IBL and the teacher was much better at it than Devlin, so I know what good IBL teaching/facilitating is.) Overall, there is probably a better mathemathical thinking/logic class out there than this one, but it is a Stanford class, so there is a prestige factor. It's run by Coursera, so the provider is a pro at this.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>108</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Mathematical Thinking</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>111680</review_data_id><review_date>2015-08-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course is illuminating and has changed the way I view the world and problems in general.

Keith Devlin is a wonderful teacher. Being taught by Dr. Devlin is a real joy. He is inspiring and challenging, he has a great sense of humour and at all times he is directly communicating to the learner. In the course videos one very soon forgets that this is a MOOC and it feels like being in a small class or workshop. His style is engaging and informal, while at the same time presenting rigorous mathematical material. His focus is on the learning process and he takes students through the material with an emphasis on learning itself, as much as learning new material. He, and the community TA’s are actively involved in the forums while at the same time encouraging students to participate in the forums and learn from each other. The problem sets are well paced, with exercises prior to the problem sets that allow students to discuss issues before working on the submitted problem sets. I really enjoyed doing this course and although the material was not too much of a problem for me (I am a teacher) I have learned a lot about teaching in this course and have now integrated some of Dr. Devlin’s style into my own teaching.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>108</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Mathematical Thinking</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>3737</review_data_id><review_date>2013-11-08</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Most MOOCs focus upon learning. This MOOC focuses upon thinking. The learning MOOCs are great. I’ve learned a lot in them, but the mathematical thinking stretches one’s brain to the point of almost hurting. I was not a math major in college, but I had a lot a math related courses being a computer science major. I thought most of the course would be review for me. Most of the material was review; however, a large chunk of the course, especially the second half, is about proofs. I thought I knew what a proof was. Dr. Devlin shook my core beliefs. I’m still a bit shaky - and I was a student/TA for the course as well! This course will frustrate you. It will enlighten you. If you complete it, you will have a great feeling of accomplishment as well as a very solid foundation for additional mathematics … and thinking in general. This course offers behind-the-scene videos which I’ve not seen in other MOOCs. The first three-quarter of the videos consisted of a round table discussion with Dr. Devlin, a staff TA and a moderator. These short videos talked about MOOCs in general and how they are constructed. The final videos were presentations Dr. Devlin has made at Stanford, including lectures on the origins of numbers. We even get to see him shoot a cactus in the final video - it makes sense in the context of the video.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>108</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Mathematical Thinking</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>3729</review_data_id><review_date>2013-11-08</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>High school equivalent.

You will also get to know the difference between good and average problem solving methods(algorithms) Most important part according to me was testing. The assignment 1 used peer grading and really gives a nice idea of how to write complete test cases. It really helps to develop an understanding about writing good test case. Course content is less and you'll feel like it was stopped abruptly. Still i like the course since its lightweight and can be completed. Plus helps to get a bit to next level of python programming like OOP, Testing etc</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>68</course_id><course_title>Learn to Program: Crafting Quality Code</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>1447</review_data_id><review_date>2013-05-03</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>This course is a second part of a series.

From a pedagogical standpoint, the quality of these classes is very uneven. Although the video lectures seem well thought-out (apparently honed in the classroom), there's often no connection between them and the poorly-written exercises or assignments - which means spending a lot of time doing research or just hacking away to complete them. There was one peer- evaluated assignment, which was botched on several levels. First, we weren't given the rubric before submission (so had no idea what we were going to be judged on); second, some of the criteria were subjective (meaning we were graded according to someone's personal opinion, not whether our code actually worked or not); third, even the objective criteria were worded so poorly that students didn't understand what they were supposed to do (resulting in people losing points even when they had successfully fulfilled the requirements). In the future, I suggest Coursera use this assignment as a template for how NOT to conduct peer-assessment. If you're a beginner and you enjoy puzzles or gaming, I would recommend "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python". We did 8 peer-review projects with no problems - and it was a lot of fun.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>68</course_id><course_title>Learn to Program: Crafting Quality Code</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>1510</review_data_id><review_date>2013-05-09</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I have taken LTP: The fundamentals and from there I fell in Love with LTP from University of Toronto.

I'm happy to say that my time was well spent in this regard. This course was a follow-up to "Learn to Program: The Fundamentals". While there was more time spent on designing and implementing algorithms, the course continued the emphasis on documenting functions before writing code by showing how to write effective tests so that you know when a function does what it should. Both the assignments really added to the learning process in this regard. Though the course uses Python, this "document and test first" approach used by the instructors translates well to other languages. The course also provided a good grounding to object oriented methodologies and showed how classes can be used to create new data types. The course was short (only 5 weeks) but the quality was excellent. Both instructors explained the concepts in an engaging and easy-to-understand manner. The questions used in the quizes consolidated and added to what was taught in the classes.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>68</course_id><course_title>Learn to Program: Crafting Quality Code</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>1487</review_data_id><review_date>2013-05-05</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Before I took part in this course I had completed Learn to Program: The Fundamentals by UOT.

Like: Covered many interesting topics, although most involved data structures. The programming assignments were interesting, and allowed you to work in whatever language you wanted (But... see "Dislike"). The quizzes were worthwhile as well, as opposed to most online courses. The lecturer is very enthusiastic and engaging. His tone is informal and this makes the material easy (&amp; fun) to absorb. Dislike: No algorithms were covered, but this will be covered in Part 2 of this course. Tim Roughgarden's handwriting is a little tough to understand, although he gave ample warning at the beginning of the course. The programming assignments only checked the final output and you couldn't receive too much feedback on your code (But, this provided for some advantages... see "Like"). Suggested improvements: Provide more programming assignments. Overall: A good course to get started with algorithms, Tim Roughgarden explains even the toughest of concepts with ease.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16</course_id><course_title>Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>640</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-13</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>It's true. This is a key course! After this course I see algorithms everywhere (not only in computers) and I can analyse and improve them. Here's a real life example (it actually happened): My mother had to order 300 papers, by the ID of some person. I helped her, using one of the algorithms that I learned with this course. Doing that, the work needed was reduced from 90,000 steps to 2,468. We didn't even use any computer, we only changed the way we ordered and compare the numbers of those papers. Yes I think, this course makes you a little bit smarter. Professor Tim Roughgarden has the minimal perfect examples to show the exact point of every algorithm, you can see all the things that could happen with one of those algorithms and then understand them deeply and better. Also, those rather abstract alghorithms I learned, resulted being tremendously useful in various areas afterwards, for example in networks and artificial intelligence. Finally, the programming assignments are great, they make you get your hands "dirty" and understand very well what really happens.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16</course_id><course_title>Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>7043</review_data_id><review_date>2014-03-26</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1 is an interesting course covering some of what Prof Roughgarden calls the greatest hits of computer science. It's focused much more on math and correctness than is Sedgewick's Algorithms series, which deals with concrete implementations. So they are very different courses despite having similar names. Unfortunately, this type of course doesn't translate nearly as well to the MOOC format as the more implementation centered course by Sedgewick. While Tim Roughgarden is a very good teacher and he gives you the same lectures he gives his students in Stanford taking the class (the actual Stanford lectures are available online and not too hard to find in google), he cannot give the same level of assignments. In a course like this you really need to do lots of proofs and derivations, so Prof Roughgarden should really employ peer grading in future iterations of the course to make it more like the real thing. The assignments aren't as good as the lectures. The quizzes are multiple choice questions while the projects require algorithm implementations where you type in a numerical answer that can usually be arrived at even with lousy implementations of the algorithm, and often even with other much more inefficient but straightforward algorithms. I can't hold it against Tim because it's not a reflection on him, but on the limitations of the online format. I hate to sound too negative though, because I really did learn a lot from Tim in the course and the lectures are of very high quality. Overall it was a great experience taking the course. One thing I really thought was awesome was that he gave optional advanced lectures that weren't required to succeed in the class nor to get an excellent overview of the subject, but that filled in details in the more difficult corners of the topics discussed. Overall I'd highly recommend the course, but would also suggest having a textbook like CLRS to work problems out of while you go through it. My personal highlight in the course was Karger's algorithm for finding minimum cuts in graphs, as it's often not taught until graduate level in a course on randomized algorithms.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16</course_id><course_title>Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>61133</review_data_id><review_date>2014-12-09</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Part I of Stanford’s course on algorithms, taught by Prof. Tim Roughgarden, begins by laying out the criteria by which an algorithm can be judged -- its complexity in time and space, and how well it scales to large input sets. The class then turns to divide-and-conquer algorithms, graph algorithms, and data structures such as heaps, binary search trees, hash tables and Bloom filters. The class is not introductory -- programming ability and basic familiarity with the concepts presented is assumed. As it happens, all of the topics in this class (and its successor) are covered at a simpler level in the excellent MIT 6.00x online class, which should be considered a prerequisite for this one. I would have been quite lost without that introduction, and certainly never felt as if I was covering the same ground again -- this class delves far deeper. Prof. Roughgarden is a fabulous teacher. His presentation is so articulate and so engagingly down-to-earth that you can lose sight of how complex the material actually is. Fear not, however, because the challenging weekly problem sets will have you scurrying back to the slides and maybe the lectures as well to deepen your understanding. The final exam has a few difficult problems but by and large is easier than the problem sets. Besides the problems, there are weekly programming assignments that have you coding up one of the algorithms discussed that week. You can use whatever language you want -- you’re given a dataset and asked to submit results. In a couple of cases, the datasets are so large that your programming environment may crash, as mine did, resulting in panicked discussion-board postings a lot of ad hoc advice. It was unnecessary. Yes, coding algorithms in the real world means figuring out how to accommodate the limits of your system, but such strategies are not covered in this course and solutions can be elusive. Just getting the algorithm to work right is challenge enough. This is a computer-science course and there’s plenty of math – proofs galore, probabilities, topologies and much more. But it’s never math for math’s sake. Prof. Roughgarden always introduces topics with a statement of motivation – how a mathematical construct can describe or model real-world systems, the sometimes-surprisingly practical applications of abstract graph algorithms or esoteric data structures. The syllabus progresses through a diverse series of topics but the unifying theme is identifying a job to be done and figuring out how best to do it – and more importantly, understanding the elastic limits of “best.”</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16</course_id><course_title>Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>52713</review_data_id><review_date>2014-08-31</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I took this course and the follow up, both taught by professor Roughgarden. I taught myself some java beforehand and I studied math in college, which definitely helped when it came to understanding the proofs. The only other coursera courses I had taken were the princeton series in design of algorithms by professor Sedgewick (also great). Professor Roughgarden is awesome. His explanations, proofs, and the motivations for them are well articulated and concise. The course was a nice hybrid between an applied course and a theoretical one, almost all results had an accompanying proof. That said, this course is more mathematical than the princeton ones. The problem sets require a thorough understanding of the material and the programming assignments took me a long time (I am a novice programmer). The discussion boards were very lively and people provided a lot of useful insight into how to approach the problems, without ever giving away the answer. I highly recommend this course to anyone wanting to learn more about algorithms and I had a great time taking it.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16</course_id><course_title>Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>50675</review_data_id><review_date>2014-08-14</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Tim Roughgarden is by far the best instructor I have encountered in the MOOC world so far - he manages to be mathematically concise and absolutely hilarious at the same time. The current iteration of part 2 actually has a thread on the discussion forums titled "Favorite Tim Roughgarden quotes", and it has gotten quite some attention. Tim's mantra ("Can we do better?") will stay with me forever. About the course... Pros: The topics are carefully chosen and always motivated by some real-life problem. The programming assignments were absolutely awesome. Some reviewers criticized the absence of an auto-grader, but this has been a conscious decision to enable people to choose whatever programming language they want to work in, so the whole auto- grader issue is really just a matter of preference. I think it makes sense for this course, since the focus is clearly not on implementation-specific details. Another reviewer criticized the (huge) size of the data sets for the programming assignments. I have to politely disagree. If I'm confronted with a relatively small data set, I might as well go ahead and just use a brute-force implementation. Sure, I can run a sophisticated algorithm on a small data set - after all, I'm doing this class because I want to learn something new... But well, I think we all know how that can go. Personally, I found it highly motivating to deal with data sets that made a brute-force approach absolutely unfeasible. It also made me think very hard about the data structures I used - space is definitely an issue in some of the assignments. Cons: For some reason I just couldn't get myself to enjoy the weekly quizzes. I have thought about it for a while, and I still can't quite figure out why I disliked them. I'll try to explain anyway. There seemed to be two types of questions: The first type required some light-weight calculations, maybe two or three lines and/or some doodling. Those were okay, although I wouldn't have minded something a little more challenging. The second type of questions were... kind of black- and-white. Either you were looking at the problem from the right angle (and then the correct answer was obvious), or you weren't (and then it was just like, "huh?"). I'll admit that I had my fair share of aha-moments with the type-2 questions, and they did complement the lectures nicely, but still, something was missing. I felt like I didn't engage as much with the material as I would have liked. Now the con part of my review turned out to be almost as long as the pro part... but don't let that fool you. This is a great course, highly recommended!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16</course_id><course_title>Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>29873</review_data_id><review_date>2015-08-10</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Excellent lectures.

At first I thought that would be great - I can use whatever language I'm most comfortable with - but there are big downsides to this. First, you won't get to see sample code from the instructor after an assignment to compare with your own. And second, since so many different languages are in use, it's hard to get help in the forums. I made it through the sorting algorithms, but I had to give up when we got to graph algorithms, because I had trouble implementing the data structures. I think a better approach would have been to pick a popular language such as Java or Python, and conduct the class in that language. The instructor could then provide a code base that included the data structures, and the students could just focus on implementing the algorithms.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16</course_id><course_title>Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>340</review_data_id><review_date>2012-11-06</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Like it a lot.

As he says in the opening lectures about how students come back to him and tell him how this course helped them pass an interview, I can not stress how much more prepared I am now for algorithmic questions and problems.

I've been a software professional for ~30 years. This course compliments Sedgewick's Algorithms courses from Princeton and also on Coursera. Pros: \+ Tim’s enthusiasm - “blazingly fast” algorithms. \+ Proofs had enough description to follow without getting bogged down in too much rigor. \+ Tim’s practical advice: \+ Constant, linear and loglinear operations are so fast that we also get them for free, so we should always consider running them on our data sets, even if it’s not obvious at first that doing so will help solve the problem. For example: \+ Loglinear sort your data. Maybe sorted data will help in the solution. \+ Heap your data. Maybe its constant operations may come in useful later. \+ BFS and DFS linear algorithms are the fast workhorses of graph problems. If you’re not sure how to approach a solution, just do Breadth and/or Depth First Searches to see if either or both approaches lead to the solution. \+ Think about your sub- algorithm needs. For example, Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm requires processes nodes based upon a greedy algorithm that wants the next shortest total sub-path link. When a superlative is part of an algorithm, such as “shortest,” then think about using a heap or priority queue which returns superlative values efficiently. \+ You don’t need to “solve” complicated recurrence relations. If you have a hunch (or hope) of its form, try induction to confirm it. Cons: \+ Some of the quizzes and assignments had confusing wording. They should be reviewed and addressed. \+ The programming assignments involved data that was massively larger than it had to be. A program that finds strongly connected components in a 1,000 node graph properly will work just properly on an 800,000+ node graph, but without straining the development environment. \+ I don’t recall seeing Tim on the forums. A greater presence, even if only to address clarification in confusing assignment wording would have been appreciated.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16</course_id><course_title>Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>30851</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-06</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>This course is truly brilliant. What do I mean by that? There is no one algo course to fit everybody: 1) Essence of this course is in crystal clear explanation of the material. It's especially good for people with conceptual and birds-eye way of thinking. Problem sets are doable but you'll get challenge problems (not graded) that sometimes are really hard. 2) It's not a math class (like CLRS and MIT course), it's rather use this approach from UCB textbook (p. 9): "Playing on the strengths of our students , instead of dwelling on formal proofs we distilled in each case the crisp mathematical idea that makes the algorithm work". 3) It's also not a programming class - go to Princeton course. There is a programming assignment on every week but it's by far not enough to understand proper implementation of an algo.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16</course_id><course_title>Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>30748</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-05</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Prior experience: I'm software developer with 5 years of experience, thus I had a lot of prior knowledge on the topic before taking this course, but I desired to refresh some of them. Pros: 1\. There are excellent programming assignments in the course. There is no way to solve it without implementing algorithms optimally. 2\. Lectures is consistent, coherent and well read. 3\. There are challenging enought optional theoretical problems in the course. Cons: 1\. The algorithms analysis topic coverage has flaws (e.g. amortization analysis wasn't mentioned at all). 2\. Despite course is introductory many students already familiar with topic, but the is no really difficult (optional) programming assignmens in the course. Overall: I think this course is excelent for anyone who want to familiarize yourself with algorithms. It's also suitable for refreshing knowledge on the topic despite it is primarily aimed to beginners.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16</course_id><course_title>Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>4679</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-15</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I completed this course with 98% score.

The course teaches some fundamental principles of algorithm analysis like big O notation and other important topics in algorithm design like data structures to represent graphs, the divide and conquer paradigm, heaps and hash tables. Algorithms discussed include quick sort, breadth first search, depth first search, finding strongly connected components of a graph and Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm. The course requires the ability to program, but it is language neutral, meaning you can use whatever language you are most comfortable with to complete the assignments. The material is fairly dense and the quizzes and programming assignments are difficult if you haven’t taken a course on algorithms before. I’d highly recommend this course to anyone that wants to get serious about going beyond basic programming/scripting and learning some real computer science.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16</course_id><course_title>Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>2747</review_data_id><review_date>2013-07-13</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course is difficult, but it is top notch quality, and it really delivers the learning possibility of a real top university course.

The theory being taught in this course was complimented nicely by the practical Java programming being taught in Prof. Sedgewick's course. I especially enjoyed Prof. Roughgarden's enthusiasm and teaching style. I don't have any real complaints about the course. Two thumbs-up and looking forward to the second part of the course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>16</course_id><course_title>Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>1514</review_data_id><review_date>2013-05-09</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>I came at this course without any formal background in computer science. Everything I know I've learned as a result of simply learning as I go. However it occurred to me I could never pass a technical interview because I didn't know the most basic of algorithms that interviewers expect you to know. Pros: \- Taking this course made me feel like a bad-ass software developer. I now have a good understanding of algorithm complexity and how to develop solutions in any areas where performance is an issue. \- Tim knows his stuff Cons: \- Tim's handwriting is often quite poor AND what he is diagramming/writing often seem to be way out of sync with what he is saying. This makes things really confusing. I often found I had to look away from the screen and just listen to his voice. \- In some of the other courses I've taken I really get the feeling the professor is there to help me learn.. In this one it feels like Tim is there to simply convey information. \- This course did not take advantage of the medium. For algorithms like quick sort or merge sort I can fully understand it with a simple animation so much easier than a long description. See here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_G9BkAm6B8 In conclusion I think with a bit more effort this course could be amazing.

I decided to grant myself about 10 hours per week to solve all assignments to optimality using different techniques that I always wanted to try out on a problem, but never had time or opportunity to do so. If you have a similar objective towards this course, I can highly recommend you to take it; I had a lot of fun and learnt a lot for the following reasons: * The problem instances are not easy to solve (some are really hard) even though the problem assignments are all wellknown problems. * The electronic submission systems returns an immediate feedback on the quality of your submitted solution and indicates how far away you are from the optimal solution. This was great to assess the current state of the algorithm and also motivated to do better. * It was quite easy to interface external solvers or use other programming languages than Python. This was quite motivating to try out (and compare) different tools/languages. Also, you don't need to mess around with side works like processing instance data etc; the provided python scripts do all this for you. You can just focus on implementing your algorithm. * I watched the lectures on LS and MIP and enjoyed them a lot. Pascal is a fantastic teacher and has a very clear and structured way of explaining things, using very illustrative examples. * There are also discussion forums that I discovered quite late in the course. I found them extremely interesting, in particular to read how others tackle the assignments and what problems they have experienced. In my opinion, the forums contain a considerable amount of very valuable experience that is worth reading. * The staff of the course are extremely motivated and committed. They are involved in the discussion forums and provide weekly video mailbags in which they discuss the current status and updates. They really strive to communicate with the students. This gave me the feeling of really being involved within the course community and not of simply interacting with a webpage. I found this very motivating to keep on the (hard) work. * Finally, doing this course showed me again how much you learn by actually trying out things (in contrast to simply reading about them) and that also as an 'expert' there is still much to learn. In the end, I completed the course and had to work hard to make it to a distinction within my restricted time budget (and I was very proud and excited for having achieved it! :) In my opinion, this is a challenging, fun course from which you can learn a lot, even if you are already an expert in one of the fields.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>169</course_id><course_title>Discrete Optimization</course_title><school>School:  The University of Melbourne</school><review_data_id>2696</review_data_id><review_date>2013-07-05</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I consider this course the best course I have ever attended (in Coursera or elsewhere), and prof.

And since I work as a programmer, it's not like getting the programming assignments done was a burden for me. Warning: Prof. van Hentenryck is trying to cover a huge field in a relatively short time, so his presentation tends to be rushed. In the process, he mentions things seemingly casually, almost in passing, that are, in fact, quite important. One thing I agonized over, eventually figuring out what I needed to do to make progress on one assignment, turned out to be a partial remembering/recreation of something in my own notes that I'd since mostly forgotten. He hadn't laid out the reasoning or importance quite enough for it to stick in my head, I guess. It was a bit of a challenge, at the time, but having worked through it myself in the face of a real problem, I came away certain to remember the relevant concepts, and their importance, forever.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>169</course_id><course_title>Discrete Optimization</course_title><school>School:  The University of Melbourne</school><review_data_id>3114</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I had no experience with Python or basic computational algorithms, so the learning curve was steep at first.

The course is tough, time consuming but great fun and very rewarding. The professor and his team have done a great job preparing this course and actively monitor the discussions on the forum. Time and again they give warnings that this course is intended to be hard. In one of the first videos the prof wears a builders helmet and gives yet another warning: "this is not a lecture, this is WORK!!" A very passionate teacher he is. Discussing the assignments on the forum is encouraged, the honour code being less strict. If you have a background in maths and programming and are willing to settle for an 'ordinary' statement of accomplishment, it need not be so hard and time consuming at all. But if you want 'with distinction' - that's when the hard work begins. And then there is this thing called the 'leader board' where you can see how your fellow students are doing on the assignments. If you want your name on the top of that list... This is one of these very special courses where you will be sad when it's over.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>169</course_id><course_title>Discrete Optimization</course_title><school>School:  The University of Melbourne</school><review_data_id>3150</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-31</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The best course I have ever taken.

There are other classes that cover aspects of DO like linear and integer programming and deeply delve into the theory of how and why these techniques work. But it is much harder to find a class that discusses local search heuristics, and this class may be unique in its focus on actually solving very tough examples of classic DO problems "by any means necessary." The difficulty of the hardest problems combined with the smorgasbord of usable techniques and the open collaboration policy on the forums makes it feel almost like you are part of a research team instead of a student doing coursework. And in some sense you are, since not all of the best known solutions for these problems have been proved optimal and areas like the vehicle routing problem continue to be very actively researched. Considering the entire complexity class of these NP-Complete problems is not deeply understood, this should perhaps not be too surprising. Combining this collaborative "research" aspect of the course with the competition aspect of the leaderboards yields a really memorable experience. It is also a class that can scale to the level of effort you're willing to throw at it. For example, graduating with a certificate is a significant accomplishment, but should be manageable for most people with enough programming background to be comfortable implementing algorithms from informal descriptions. Getting distinction is significantly more difficult and time consuming and will often require many iterations of work improving your first solutions. And if you really aspire to produce the best solution on the leaderboard for the toughest problems, prepare for a lot of sleepless nights! Whatever level you want to approach the class at, I think you are sure to learn something!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>169</course_id><course_title>Discrete Optimization</course_title><school>School:  The University of Melbourne</school><review_data_id>3126</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I was fantastic.

Also, proffesor Pascal Van Hentenryck is an awesome lecturer and his explanations are short, clear and easy to understand.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>169</course_id><course_title>Discrete Optimization</course_title><school>School:  The University of Melbourne</school><review_data_id>3116</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I've just finished the first offering of this course and I absolutely loved it. It was hard but extremely rewarding. Go for it if you're up for the challenge - you'll have a blast! The course format was slightly unusual in that all of the material, including all of the problem sets, was made available from the start. Several different techniques were introduced and students were encouraged to try them on the various problems, the point being to emphasise that no one method is necessarily ideal even within a single class of problem. Prof. van Hentenryck exhibited huge enthusiasm for the subject matter and there was lively discussion amongst students on the forum with frequent input from tireless staff member, Carleton, as well as from the professor, himself. I came in to the course with zero prior experience of the subject matter. Consequently, I faced a pretty steep learning curve and had to put in rather a lot of hours to get there. Furthermore, the nature of the problems means that there is often the possibility of revisiting them, armed with new ideas, to try to achieve a better solution. The "12+ hrs" workload categorisation is a very relaxed lower bound on the time I spent. This course has the potential to eat up your every spare moment, not because you have to, but because you want to...</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>169</course_id><course_title>Discrete Optimization</course_title><school>School:  The University of Melbourne</school><review_data_id>3115</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I really enjoyed this course and I will remember it for the rest of my life. The format of the course was to solve a series of difficult problems with little guidance but with reference to a set of lectures that gave practical descriptions of methods that could be applied to the problems. What made me like the course was that it treated its students with respect and showed us how to solve difficult problems without out any hand holding. There were many ways this course could be improved upon (more written notes, more direction etc) but that misses the point. This course was inspiring because \- the assessment problems were challenging. \- the lectures explained how to think about problems like the assessment problems but not how to solve the assessment problems per se. I thought that I was learning useful skills and not just trying to get good grades. \- the lectures showed a great love of the subject being taught which rubbed off on me.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>169</course_id><course_title>Discrete Optimization</course_title><school>School:  The University of Melbourne</school><review_data_id>3112</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>All other optimization MOOC I've seen focus mostly on Linear and Integer Programming. This course, however, explores a wider range of topics, starting with basics like Dynamic Programming and Branch'n'Bound, and then proceeding with in-depth coverage of Constraint Programming, Local Search and Integer Programming. The approach of this course is 'learn by doing': students get instances of optimization problems and should solve them with whatever methods they've learned. Such approach results in unique learning experience, when students discover the nature of optimization by applying different methods to the same problem instances. As a result, after finishing this class students have very good intuition about pros and cons of different optimization methods and are very confident in their ability to solve real-world optimization problem. I would highly recommend this course to everyone, just to get the feeling of how exciting and addictive a MOOC can be. Even if you're not currently interested in discrete optimization, halfway into the course you are likely to loose your sleep over thinking of how to optimally solve Travelling Salesman Problem with 33810 cities or optimally color a huge random graph. This course is particularly recommended to those, who took Tim Roughgarden's "Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 2". I'm sure you guys are curious to know, how NP-complete problems are dealt with in practice.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>169</course_id><course_title>Discrete Optimization</course_title><school>School:  The University of Melbourne</school><review_data_id>3106</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-28</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>A great mooc!

Logically it's impossible for students new to the topics, to learn all the (1) constraint programming, (2) local search and (3) integer programming in just 7 weeks. In a regular class, it needs one semester for each topic, and this short course trying to deliver 3 topics in one. Sorry, but this is more a mission impossible for students new to the topics. And we don't have a well structured course. It's more like a competition than a course. Below quoted from the course's forum, a feedback from student I agree very much: "We feel that we are being left alone with only some general hints to implement complex algorithms. We would like to see more in-depth explanations on how to apply the material to the given problems. Especially more advanced techniques would then be more accessible to the average student. Additionally I find the lectures a bit short and superficial. Going into more detail would benefit the course.

It is challenging (I would say it's on par with Prof. Keller's PGM course, hope it will be restarted some day), but very engaging and rewarding. The course is structured in an unusual way: all videos and all assignments are open from the beginning, with "free" deadlines added to keep students on track. This combination provokes your procrastination, but please beware: "nah, I'll do it all in a last week" attitude will fail you, because you will probably need 2 to 3 weeks of full-time engagement to complete the course, better spread them throughout full course duration. Instructor did an amazing job to present the material. The only thing that I can complain about is lesser engagement of Prof. Hentenryck in the third offering compared to previous ones :) But it's really the only thing that I can think of. All in all, the course is amazing. 10/10 would do again (4th time)!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>169</course_id><course_title>Discrete Optimization</course_title><school>School:  The University of Melbourne</school><review_data_id>28521</review_data_id><review_date>2014-04-10</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I had only known some concepts about discrete problems, and the course was a very nice and convenient further expansion on this.

Also the uneasy data samples. Have to follow the discussion forum to get ideas to be able to approach the expected results. This course has very unique programming assignments with Leader Board table listing all students' result sorted based on best result. Hard for me because I've never taken any optimization class before, only maybe basic experiences in programming took me to complete this course with only enough points to pass. I'm enrolling again this course in the upcoming 2014 session, hopefully I'll be better after finishing other more basic courses on optimization =D Update 2014 session: Great! I learn a lot more. Really very interesting &amp; precious course. I read a lot of positive feedbacks in the discussion forum. Now the course has a ungraded Set Cover problem, and the web-based assignments visualization, and changes in the warehouse location data. My keywords: branch and bound (knapsack); iterated greedy, CP, cliques (graph coloring); simulated annealing, k-opt, clustering, lin-kernighan heuristic (travelling salesman); MIP, nearest-neighbors, LNS (facility location); MIP with subtour elimination, lazy constraints, nearest-neighbors, greedy as initial solution, local search, cluster-first route-second (vehicle routing).

The workload is quite demanding (probably unless you have solid previous experience with the topics or you are outstanding programmer), but its very much worth it. It is a very enjoyable learning experience from start to end. Videos offer a lot of information to process but they are also fun to watch, very unconventional and never dull. Assignments are also very interesting and offer quite a challenge. After you finish this course you really have a sense of achieving something worthwhile and challenging, and you know you learned a lot while at the same time having fun all the way through. This course would probably also make you a better programmer overall due to the assignments that require from you to constantly improve on your code (so its not only discrete optimization, in a way its code optimization as well).</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>169</course_id><course_title>Discrete Optimization</course_title><school>School:  The University of Melbourne</school><review_data_id>3604</review_data_id><review_date>2013-10-28</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Exciting subject, Prof. Van Hentenryck is walking enthusiasm, each assignment is tough and challenging and there is plenty of room for improvement (of solution, not the problem).

The course is not without issues -- the lectures are huge in length, and the format is not balanced well -- you learn about all theory upfront and then you guess which approach to take. There are no small, warm-up problems, to test given technique. Despite any problem that you can face, my advice, take this course, you can be frustrated, but you won't regret it (the course is VERY time- consuming, so make sure you don't have any other commitments).</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>169</course_id><course_title>Discrete Optimization</course_title><school>School:  The University of Melbourne</school><review_data_id>3264</review_data_id><review_date>2013-09-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>A subject I did not realise I was interested in, but have already put my learning to practice at work.

I had no knowledge of discrete optimization before. The course has several assignments, which are have from 6 to 8 sub-assignments. Once you cracked the first you WILL have to change tactic in between as the problems become increasingly difficult. Carleton and the Prof have tirelessly answered the forums and presented mail bags (weekly videos) about the progress of the class. You will also get data and feedback in graph form, how others perform, there are graphs and histograms about the results and the overall progress of the class. You feel part of a class because of this. This is not some Prof just throwing mindlessly stuff at you in a monotonous voice. The videos are technically great, Pascal is really enthusiastic and Carleton his TA is the most dedicated and helpful TA you will experience. The University of Melbourne seems to have put professional video editing in place as one can see in a video that is posted elsewhere. The free approach leads to a practical approach. In the end I didn't watch all lectures as I figured out what seem to be the important techniques. I like practical, result orientated approaches, after all you also have to optimize your learning too. Off all the classes I have completed and all the classes I dropped as they were boring or uninspired this is by far the best MOOC I have experienced so far. But do not take this class, if you have few programming experience, have difficulties compiling open source software and are of a mindset that all has to be delivered on a plate. This class is for self starters that do not give up and have enough time to dedicate to it. Given the data presented by the DO team. ~4000 started and 795 received a certificate. That is a ~1/5 pass rate. Of the 795 passes ~0.48% received distinction. I deducted 1/2 a point as there is just too much material to learn it all. You don't need all to pass though, which might be a lecture in itsself,</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>169</course_id><course_title>Discrete Optimization</course_title><school>School:  The University of Melbourne</school><review_data_id>3015</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-21</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>Unless i miss my mark this is a graduate level class in Computer Science. Successful students will most likely be near or above that level. Discrete Optimization is an introduction to solving some of the most difficult problems in computer science. So be ready for: 1) upwards of 12+ hours a week 2) increasingly demanding assignments 3) no hand holding. A wonderful overview that really teaches you the how to think about the problems in the right way. Your going to have to reach out to a lot of other resources to pass the later assignments. To give perspective to the one star review i offer this: Student:. I think that there is a gap between the lectures and the exercises. Put differently I feel that we are being left alone with only some general hints to implement complex algorithms. Professor: This is intentional of course. What we are trying to do is to make you experiment the techniques by yourself, and not just give an algorithm that everyone can implement. We would like you to understand the techniques or existing solvers in some depth and also discover which approaches work and which do not on each problem (several may work on the same problem but for different instances). The point being is that you need to come ready to put in a lot of time. If you can climb this mountain of a class your going to be able to see very far indeed. I, alais wasn't ready.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>169</course_id><course_title>Discrete Optimization</course_title><school>School:  The University of Melbourne</school><review_data_id>75211</review_data_id><review_date>2015-05-31</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Discrete optimization is a quasi-self-paced programming course offered by the University of Melbourne through Coursera that is all about solving hard problems. Hard problems in the context of this course means NP-hard problems--problems with exponential worst-case running times. The course differs from most classes on Coursera and elsewhere on the web in that all the materials are available as soon as the course opens, but there is a final deadline for the programming assignments, so it is not a self-paced course in the truest sense. The entire course grade is based on 5 programming assignments: the knapsack problem, graph coloring, traveling salesman, warehouse location and vehicle routing. An average score of 7 (out of 10) on each part of each programming assignment is required to earn a certificate. Discrete optimization opens with an introductory lecture series on the knapsack problem that lasts a couple of hours followed by three longer lecture series, covering constraint programming, local search and mixed integer programming. The lectures do not need to be viewed in any particular order. Similarly, students can work on the homework projects in any order they choose. This level of freedom is great for students who want to work ahead but it may make it difficult to complete the course if you don't plan ahead because the programming assignments can be very time consuming. The assignment skeleton and submission code is written in Python 2.7, but you can use languages if you want. The professor, Pascal Van Hentenryck, is extremely energetic and passionate about the subject. He makes the lecture videos surprisingly fun for such a dense subject. The lecture videos themselves are well-made and the professor does a good job explaining the material, although I sometimes felt like the course was trying to cover too many different topics and it wasn't always clear how one would go about applying the methods in lecture to the assignments or using them without using some external package or solver. A little more instruction and direction in that regard would be helpful. Discrete optimization is challenging course with great programming assignments that introduces many different tools and leaves them on the table for you to play with. The tools don't always with full instruction manuals, so you'll have to figure out many of the details yourself. You won't have time to apply every tool to every problem, but if you focus on one and budget your time well, you'll have a good shot at making it through. I give discrete optimization 4 out of 5 stars: Very Good.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>169</course_id><course_title>Discrete Optimization</course_title><school>School:  The University of Melbourne</school><review_data_id>74515</review_data_id><review_date>2015-05-06</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I think this course is great. The lectures are top quality and I like that it is self paced. I highly recommend it. The assignments can be very time consuming. It is important to make sure that you have the recommended time available if you intend to complete the course. If you can't make that much time available, you can take away as much as you can and then retake the course the next time it is offered. It is not unusual for a participant to take the course two times. I had no experience with Python before taking this class, but found my exposure to the language to be an added benefit of the course. I like Python and can see myself using it in the future. It seems easy to learn and use. In that way, it reminds me of BASIC.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>169</course_id><course_title>Discrete Optimization</course_title><school>School:  The University of Melbourne</school><review_data_id>74502</review_data_id><review_date>2015-05-05</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I thought this was an excellent way for an interested learner that wants to work at his own pace to rapidly gain some useful intellectual tools for doing optimization. The instructor's zeal for the material was infectious, and so the lectures were as fun as they were informative. The course staff was very helpful, and I really appreciated the practical focus of everyone involved. I especially enjoyed the open-ended nature of the assignments where it was up to the student to select the tools and methods to apply to individual problems. I tried a lot of different stuff, and as a result, gained a lot of useful experience. The coursera platform was a great way to work through the course material. This was my first stab at a MOOC learning experience, and I'm sold. The organization of the assignments into what amounted to minature contests was an interesting approach, and I think it was motivating for me. I still feel the urge to take a second look at the problems I scored 7's on. The only real advice I have for improving the class would be to maybe collect together some useful background material for folks that like to dig into the details. I know I did a fair bit of searching, which is probably a good skill to develop in its own right, but it would have been nice to have a small set of curated material available as a research seed.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>401</course_id><course_title>Understanding Einstein: The Special Theory of Relativity</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>3351</review_data_id><review_date>2013-10-07</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>Unfortunately this class made me feel as though time itself had slowed down.

Prof. Langerstrom is an outstanding teacher. He presented what can be confusing ideas in a very clear and concise way and he did it with charm and humility. Of all the resources out there for learning SR, this class is far and away the absolute best resource. It gives both a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the subject. My math is rusty so it was helpful that he went through ever step of the math explaining each step clearly. The Coursera format is also excellent and allows you (if you're viewing online) to speed up and slow down the presentation. So, for me, I was able to speed through the parts that I knew well and focus on those I wanted a better understanding of. I can not say enough nice things about Coursera and Prof. Langerstrom. Both put on a first class presentation. HIghly recommend it to anyone of any age and background.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>401</course_id><course_title>Understanding Einstein: The Special Theory of Relativity</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>1908</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-08</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>One of the best, thanks Prof. Larry Lagerstrom. 1\. You don't need much math of physics knowledge to complete it 2\.

The professor takes a lot of time to explain this theory, and many of it's consequences. Consequently, if you are already well versed in this theory, the presentation might seem drawn out. However for those who are not well versed, the time taken helps immensely in the ability to grasp and understand the "weirdness". And even those well versed will learn something through the excellent presentation of concepts, vital to real understanding of this subject. A class well worth taking!!!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>401</course_id><course_title>Understanding Einstein: The Special Theory of Relativity</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>1852</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-03</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Professor Lagerstrom is one of the best professors I have had the pleasure to learn from. With nothing but a whiteboard, a few colored markers and a few yardsticks, he assures that you understand completely his explication of the Special theory of relativity, somethng that I have tried to understand on my own several ties before. Some may feel that his teaching methods lack technical sophistication; I on the other hand, think that his no-frills approach is the essence of clarity. Way to go, Professor Larry, keep on teaching MOOCS.

I am now going to continue my learning on this topic with Paul Davies' book "About time".</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>401</course_id><course_title>Understanding Einstein: The Special Theory of Relativity</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>1813</review_data_id><review_date>2013-05-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I had read books about Einstein's theories written for the general public but always had trouble understanding them.

I have done a few paid-for online courses and been very disappointed by the standard and the structure, but this exceeded all my expectations. I have learned a lot about the subject and all for free. I am an education junkie who is currently hampered by lack of funds, so Coursera suits me down to the ground. I have a degree in literature and the level of this course was certainly degree standard in terms of the video lectures. Professor Rabkin is an inspiring lecturer with a tangible passion for the subject. This was infectious. There were two to three hours of lectures each week plus a short extra video in response to something that came up that week on the forum. I felt that the Professor put a lot of time and effort into the course himself. For anyone thinking of doing the course, be aware that it takes quite a bit of time each week - I estimated that I spent 15 - 18 hours each week in reading, research, writing the essay, reviewing other essays, watching the videos and using the forum. There has been some criticism of the peer-review process and while I had a few reviews from people who did not seem to know what they were talking about (making erroneous comments about grammar, mostly), the majority of my reviewers were courteous and knowledgeable and made an effort to give constructive feedback. The grading system could be better, but overall I felt I got the grades each week that I deserved. I also felt that I learned a huge amount from doing reviews of other people's work. This democratic approach of learning from each other (with some input from the Professor but gentle and from afar) was a new experience and I found it very rewarding. The forum was fascinating - not only in terms of the ideas which people discussed, but as a fascinating study into human behaviour and psychology. Sometimes it was infuriating and sometimes perplexing, but always entertaining and often enlightening. I loved reading and thinking and writing essays but, finally, the best thing of all has been interacting with people from all over the world. I felt very much part of a global community, sharing ideas and experiences (oh, the excitement of waiting for results each week). I have also made several new friends and the learning continues as several of us (78 to date) have set up a Facebook Science Fiction and Fantasy Book Group. I've also signed up for at least twelve other courses and become an unofficial ambassador for Coursera to anyone who will listen!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45</course_id><course_title>Fantasy and Science Fiction: The Human Mind, Our Modern World</course_title><school>School:  University of Michigan</school><review_data_id>63</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-13</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This was my first experience of an online course and I thoroughly enjoyed it! The subject material was very interesting. I had the opportunity to read (and read carefully) works that I always wanted to read but never got around to do it, like Grimms' tales, Dracula and Frankenstein, but also works by authors who I didn't know and have now become favorites, like Cory Doctorow and Ray Bradbury. I particularly liked the structure of the course. In my opinion, the fact that we had to write our assignments prior to watching any lectures was very important, because I could write without prejudice and it gave me the freedom to write about whatever I thought was interesting and express my own ideas about the works. Thus, after going through that process every week, when I finally got to watch the lectures and take the quizzes, I had an adequate familiarity with each work to really enrich my reading through the lectures! It also removed the stress to having to watch the lectures in order to complete the assignments, which would have made it impossible to do them and get a grade given my busy schedule. As for the lectures, Prof. Eric Rabkin is an excellent speaker! It was easy to concentrate on what he said and understand his analyses. Regarding the content of the lectures, I found that it was rich, interesting and it really made me think more critically about the works and about fantasy literature in general. Now, regarding the peer- reviewing system... Though in an ideal world the professor and/or his assistants would (also) mark the assignments, I understand that this is impossible given the large numbers of students. However, even if at times I found the peer-reviewers' comments out of place or unhelpful and felt that I would have liked to be able to discuss it with them, it was still an interesting experience and... I did manage to get good grades. Also, that I was able to peer-review other essays, was a constructive and helpful exercise, and I hope that I did those essays justice. Lastly, through this course I came in contact with lots of great people with similar interests, with whom I had very interesting discussions and exchange of ideas on fantasy literature and more, which was very exciting and it gave me the "feel" of an actual (in- class) course. Overall, this was a great course and I hope there would be more courses like it!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45</course_id><course_title>Fantasy and Science Fiction: The Human Mind, Our Modern World</course_title><school>School:  University of Michigan</school><review_data_id>330</review_data_id><review_date>2012-11-05</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I would recommend this course for all who would like to enhance their reading. I ended up reading more than ten works that I otherwise would have put off for lack of time. The course also helped me develop the skill of thinking analytically while reading and then writing about it.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45</course_id><course_title>Fantasy and Science Fiction: The Human Mind, Our Modern World</course_title><school>School:  University of Michigan</school><review_data_id>358</review_data_id><review_date>2012-11-08</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The Good: The forum and the peer review process were fantastic, not for the peer reviews that were given, but for the learning that takes place when you try to help someone else who makes mistakes surprisingly like yours or someone who is better. That is where the real work is. The Better: Rabkin's explanations, and marvellous humanity were delightful. One has the sense that he is addressing you directly. However, Rabkin is not the only teacher in the pack: there are a large group of peer teachers who are very willing to help you if you ask them. I really have to say that I was as touched by their generousity as by Rabkins'. The Best: It worked, and Rabkin delivered on improving our writing. The limiting writing space tightened up my writing, and the exposure to such excellent writing inspired and humbled me. My writing did "go up a level" and I have been able to help others already with what I learned. The not so good: There were some people who used the anon peer process to troll, and perhaps the addition of a peer grader reputation system could help contextualize this. Also, it appears that Coursera has decided to completely ignore the grading system set out, and give out percentages: exactly what Rabkin innately knew would be a bad idea with peer grading. I think that is harmful on the part of Coursera because English is a NaN course. So, despite the little setbacks, totally predictable in a first time experiment, I would be really tempted to do it again. (264 words... coincidence?) PS: level required in the review is silly. This course cuts across levels. but I will put it as advanced.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45</course_id><course_title>Fantasy and Science Fiction: The Human Mind, Our Modern World</course_title><school>School:  University of Michigan</school><review_data_id>28589</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-07</review_date><review_value>5</review_value><review>I'm in the final week of the course, and will earn a certificate of accomplishment. Overall, I've learned from the combination of Rabkin's lectures, the reading, and the requirement to write brief (320 word) essays. Each week Rabkin assigns a full book to read, along with the required essay (8 of 10 required for a statement of accomplishment), and 5 peer reviews (30-150 words on form and content for each essay). The video lectures (about 90 minutes of listening time, which can be reduced by speeding up playback) are topical and engaging, though a few contain factual errors about the stories. Unlike some professors (Al Fireis in Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry), Rabkin shows no desire to interact with students, never participates in forum discussion, has no live webinars, and hasn't updated his lectures for a few years. However, if you want to approach fantasy and science fiction on a deeper level, his lectures will show you new insights into the work, and if you apply that level of reading to your own essays, you will gain a lot more from your reading. Peer reviews are, as expected from Coursera, a very mixed bag. They're rarely that insightful, in my experience. The essays you're required to grade are often poorly written, cobbled together work, frequently from students for whom English is a second or third language. While it's admirable that they're attempting the work, the time required to puzzle through the writing and the lack of insights most give to the reading, made peer review grading (for me) the absolutely biggest time waster and useless part of the course. One of the biggest negative surprises for me (and many others, based on forums postings) was the grading "scheme" for essays. There is a 3 point scale for form and content. Rabkin, the professor, states that a score of "2" on form and content means "successful" and that the essay is "smoothly written." But we all learned this week - at the END of the course - that awarding a "2" in the class's scoring scheme actually was the equivalent of a "D" - because a "2" in form and "2" in content gave you a "4" for the essay, or a 66% (a "D"). Most students in the class got scores below 80% because of the instructions in how to score. And despite emails to the professor during and after the class, he never responded. TA's that participated in the class stated that they had never had any contact with the professor. SO ... take it if you want to push yourself to read science fiction literature, and if you can learn from lectures and apply those to your own writing, but don't expect valuable peer feedback in general, and know that the scoring will give you a high likelihood of a low Coursera grade. On the plus side, no one in the entire market economy is going to give you a job or fire you because of a Coursera score.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45</course_id><course_title>Fantasy and Science Fiction: The Human Mind, Our Modern World</course_title><school>School:  University of Michigan</school><review_data_id>722</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-19</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I loved reading (or rereading) most of the course literature (all but two works available online for free incidentally). Fantasy works...which bridged into Sci Fi...Brothers Grimm, Alice in Wonderland, Frankenstein, Dracula (the Great Granddaddy to modern vampire stories, some HG Wells works, other early sci fi...up to some modern authors, including wonderful Ray Bradbury. (How did I NOT read him earlier!!!) Now some of the more modern works (in my opinion) were too fashionable (i.e. followed modern thought/fashionable but ill founded ideas) and thus not so good (like Ursula LeGuin Left Hand of Darkness). Tho I must note that others loved her work. The course load is medium and you are allowed to miss a little work but still pass the course (10 weeks of reading in the 2012 version is a fair commitment...!). My writing skills quickly sharpened up as I wrote the short required essays. My analytical skills sharpened as I graded others' essays. But they have a little more work to do to make peer grading practices a bit more standard across the board. The boards lit up with comments of "Unfair Grading" or "Poorly written essays" as graders and recipients argued. (That spoiled some of my enjoyment.as my score reflects..till I learned to not obsess over the grade. If you do all/most assignments you will get enough adequate scores to pass.) That said, the Prof's lectures were short and engaging. Love the subtitled English. English is my native language, but when I was pressed for time, I could put on subtitles and set the video replay speed higher and still absorb the info adequately. If one's English is not good, this would be a hard class to take as a weekly essay is required and a moderate proficiency in English is needed. Perhaps they can address this issue, as the course does improve one's skills.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45</course_id><course_title>Fantasy and Science Fiction: The Human Mind, Our Modern World</course_title><school>School:  University of Michigan</school><review_data_id>64</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-13</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The Fantasy and Science Fiction course with Prof. Rabkin was a wonderful experience. I was introduced to a lot of new books and authors such as Ursula K. Le Guin and Cory Doctorow, and I also read some old favourites such as Grimm's Fairy Tales and Dracula with new eyes. The lectures were interesting and in-depth, and the practice of writing the assignments before we saw the lectures, taught us to rely on our own analyses and insights. I enjoyed myself the most on the forums, where there were some truly high-level discussions and where I met some very interesting people. The peer response system still has a few kinks that need to be ironed out, but it's nothing too serious.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45</course_id><course_title>Fantasy and Science Fiction: The Human Mind, Our Modern World</course_title><school>School:  University of Michigan</school><review_data_id>4620</review_data_id><review_date>2013-12-20</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>A very good course that makes you read, write and evaluate others.

I had not read much fantasy and science fiction, and this course was a great reason to read some of the classics (Dracula, Frankenstein, etc.). This course set a perfect tone for my summer reading. Eric Rabkin is absolutely charming, and I loved his lectures. The level is relatively high and he often talks about books not read in the class, perhaps assuming that the audience has already read them. I think that the course would be quite challenging for someone who has not had any experience analyzing literature or whose English is not particularly strong. I also enjoyed writing the essays each week. It had been a long time since I had worked my mental muscle in that way, and it was an excellent exercise -- even just as a personal endeavor. Concerning peer reviews: On the whole, I like the idea of a peer review system, especially for a course like this. Reading four other essays each week gave me the opportunity to gain additional insight into the books, and I enjoyed reading what (most) people had to say. I did not, however, find the majority of the feedback on my essays to be particularly helpful. As others have said, there were trolls -- people who were just mean for no reason. This tendency did seem to decrease as the course progressed -- I think a lot of people dropped out because the workload was fairly demanding. If people took the peer review process more seriously (and some did), I think we could all get a lot out of it in a course like this.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45</course_id><course_title>Fantasy and Science Fiction: The Human Mind, Our Modern World</course_title><school>School:  University of Michigan</school><review_data_id>321</review_data_id><review_date>2012-11-05</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>Great course, brilliant content.

Many of my classmates did not enjoy the peer review process, but my experience were 95% positive.

Because anonymous posting was allowed in the discussion boards, the atmosphere in the discussions ranged from very positive to very negative. The ability to form lasting connections with fellow students in the class was badly hampered by the poor quality of the discussion board software; personal profiles only became available midway through the course. The writing assignments were not very productive in my opinion because of the serious flaws with the peer feedback system. The peer feedback system involved grading (about which there was much confusion) and it was entirely anonymous. As a result, the peer feedback quality ranged from very positive and useful to very negative and useless, even abusive. The steadily diminishing number of people writing essays each week (5000 in the first week, down to 1400 in the final week) reflected at least in part people's dissatisfaction with the writing and peer review process. I hope that Coursera will find ways in the future to improve that process - the writing assignments and peer review did not live up to the high quality of the course topic and reading list. There was very little responsiveness by Coursera and the instructional staff to technical problems and organizational problems with the class.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45</course_id><course_title>Fantasy and Science Fiction: The Human Mind, Our Modern World</course_title><school>School:  University of Michigan</school><review_data_id>50882</review_data_id><review_date>2014-08-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I definitely improved and enhanced my knowledge of key texts and themes in these 2 genres.

I graduated from college with a BBA in Finance back in 2004, so it has been a while since I've taken a college class and I'm not sure if I will ever make it to grad school. Additionally, this is my first experience with an online course since they weren't quite so mainstream when I was in college. I've always loved reading, literature, and science fiction and fantasy. I've been looking for a good online book club for a while, so when I discovered this class on Coursera, I thought it would be great for me. The class has definately exceeded my expectations. I have learned so much not only from Professor Rabkin, but from other students on the forums and through the peer reviews. Being a full-time working mom, I normally don't spare a lot of time for reading, but this class has made me read more books in the 11 weeks than I sometimes read in a year. It is definately time consuming and I am currently sacrificing precious Christmas crocheting time to finish the course up. It has certainly been worth it though. Professor Rabkin's lectures are amazing and insightful. It really feels like he is speaking directly to me. I'm sad that this class is coming to an end. If I had any suggestions, I think it would have been nice to have spent an extra week on the Dracula unit. It was the longest work of the course and there was so much to analyze. It was my favorite book of the course, so I may go back and re-read it at some point. This course has given me everything and more that I wanted - exposure to books I wouldn't have normally read, and a challenge. I think it would be neat to see it offered again, but with a different selection of readings. I would definately do it again. Also, I think it would be neat if Professor Rabkin could compile a list of recommended books at the end of the course so we can further our knowledge of this genre.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>45</course_id><course_title>Fantasy and Science Fiction: The Human Mind, Our Modern World</course_title><school>School:  University of Michigan</school><review_data_id>3879</review_data_id><review_date>2013-11-16</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>The very engaging lectures and on screen persona by the Professor ensured that working on the course didn't feel a lonely experience. The depth of insight into a genre of literature was truly enriching. Peer interaction was intensive and useful. On my session there was no direct engagement by course staff on the forums, nonetheless the course had so many motivated and some very competent students that with the excellent course material, a good educational experience was achieved. As with any MOOC, meeting peers online can be a varied experience so ensure to read the forum guidelines, follow the good and useful, and ignore the occasional impoliteness. Allow enough time for reading especially if English is a second language, preferably read the books ahead of the course and re-read parts for the course. Great course!

I have an interest in the topic and taking up stargazing again. I am not trying to earn credits or a degree with this course. I took this course for fun. This was my first Coursera experience. Sadly, the experience was largely negative, and I dropped the course. Compared to other college level courses, I found this course lacking is several areas. First, the instructor has very poor public speaking skills. It is difficult to learn a subject when the speaker punctuates their discussion with "ummm" or "awww" frequently. Second, in many of the courses I have taken, the lectures and the coursework had a direct relation. This course lectures do not have any relation to the course work. An example is the discussion on orbits where the lecturer spends most of a20 minute video discussion on outdated "earth-centric" universe, with less than 3 minutes to discuss the actual formula the home work will require. Third, the home work was originally forecast has requiring 3-6 hours of work per week, but the actual time was significantly greater, between 10-20 hours per week. Finally, I do not feel I really was getting anything out of this experience, other than to just read the lecture transcripts for the formulas to do the homework. I expected the course to discuss astronomy, but it was really "applied mathematics to astronomic problems" I disliked the method of teaching, with poor presentation. I disliked the home work that had no relation to the lecture. I disliked the overly burdensome time requirement for "fun" lecture. I cannot recommend this course due to the lack of teaching, and misguided attempt to discuss astronomy.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>60</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Astronomy</course_title><school>School:  Duke University</school><review_data_id>1104</review_data_id><review_date>2013-03-07</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>In spite of its title, this class seems like more than just an introduction. The material starts with the local solar system, and makes its way out in space to the furthest reaches of the known universe, and in time back to the first fraction of a second after the big bang. The video lectures are first rate, and the instructor is enthusiastic about the material. But the homework is difficult and time-consuming. Unless you have a solid background in algebra and classical mechanics, you're not going to be able to do it. I gave up on doing the homework after four weeks because of the time commitment. But there's no reason to feel guilty about just "auditing" a class. I thoroughly enjoyed just watching the lectures, and when we got to neutron stars, black holes, galaxies, and the expansion of the universe, every single lecture was mind-blowing!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>60</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Astronomy</course_title><school>School:  Duke University</school><review_data_id>1025</review_data_id><review_date>2013-03-03</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>Well, I did expect some Math and Physics but this was way too much.

Did not have the maths to complete the exams, so I audited the course. Thoughtful lecturer and good content, ranging from the easy to appreciate to discussions that I had no real idea as to what was being presented, but hung through it with a good deal of interest. The instructor was a game participant in live webcasting, which is always a nice feature of a MOOC course, even though he seemed to be in learn-as-we-go mode! No problem there. He handled it well. A wonderful learning experience. Background in the maths and physics that form the basis of astronomy definitely need to compete for a certificate of completion. However, can be taken just for the enjoyment of learning the material.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>60</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Astronomy</course_title><school>School:  Duke University</school><review_data_id>503</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-01</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is really interesting course.

The video lectures are first rate. And the programming assignments are tailor made to get a better understanding of the underlying physics with the help of math. The assignments are indeed time consuming but worth it. Couldn't take part in the discussion forums myself. But they are very good. There's nothing more you can ask for, from this course.

Make sure that you have enough time to complete it. Lectures are long, but very interesting, so you never want to skip. The material covers almost every aspect of astronomy (not very deeply of course) and provides a good opportunity to review some basic physics knowledge. No former background is needed, because everything is explained on the fly, however, some mathematical/physical enthusiasm is required to complete homework assignments. Apart from "Calculus:Single Variable" and "The Science of the Solar System", one of the best Coursera courses I took so far (out of a dozen).

One of the most challenging and rewarding classes on Coursera. Ronin Plessor's enthusiasm really draws you in. The material is what you would expect for a traditional astronomy class. Lots of math. If the course is still structured the way it was when I took it, I suggest not giving up in week 2/3 where most of the math jumps in. Stick with it! There are great things to come in the following weeks.

Ronen Plesser and the TA's were always helpful and got me through the problem sets, which were used to expand on the subjects covered in the lectures.

I was skeptical when I signed up because it's algebra based, but it definitely wasn't the kiddie intro I was initially expecting. Instead it's an unbelievably fascinating look into our universe just filled with mind-blowing discoveries, and current ones. Current as in this year or this month. Though the mathematical level is pretty low, there is a ton of information in this course. And it's not rote memorization (if it was I would have hated this class and rated it an F-); Ronen gives very clear and convincing explanations, though he talks fast so you might need to pause every once in a while to catch up! Just so much cool stuff in this course, and it really gets amazing after a few weeks in when you start learning about the formation of the solar system, then the main sequence, but the supernova, special relativity, and black hole sections are the real sweet spot of the course. Ronen is one of the most amazing teachers I have ever had the privilege to take a class from, and he and Justin are very active on the board helping people and answering tons of interesting off-topic questions too. The demonstrations he does are really cool, like making a slow-motion video of how a sound wave propagates, or another one showing how perceived gravity drops to zero in free-fall. The simulations (such as the orbit of a binary star system) are really cool too. It's a tough course even if you have more than the prereqs, but anything worth doing should be difficult. I can't recommend this course enough for anyone reading right now and considering taking the December 2013 offering. Even better, the material is spread over an extra couple of weeks this time around versus when I took it, so it should make the physics review section more manageable for people who might not have seen mechanics and E&amp;M; in a while. But you come away from this course feeling not like you know a bunch of facts, but that you understand why so many of these facts are true. It's a lot of fun.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>60</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Astronomy</course_title><school>School:  Duke University</school><review_data_id>2764</review_data_id><review_date>2013-07-16</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>This course had great information, but violated it's primary guidelines. The time commitment was supposed to be 5-7 hrs/wk, but some weeks had almost 5 hours of lecture. Just studying the lectures took the allotted time. The problem sets were very time consuming, also. It bothered me to not be able to complete the workload as I was very much interested in doing so. The forums had a lot of ignorance - not being critical, just that there were very uninformed people trying to guide others on problem sets. There wasn't good feedback to promote learning either. The professor tried to cover too much material and at too great a depth. I hope this class will be offered again, but with the approach of being an overview as it was apparently originally intended.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>60</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Astronomy</course_title><school>School:  Duke University</school><review_data_id>2035</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I had very little knowledge of astronomy before this class, but now I feel I know a lot and will major in the subject in college.

This course is built around a bunch of confusing lectures in which the instructor makes a lot of mistakes (most of which he corrects and tries to explain why they were (intentional or unintentional ) mistakes). I suppose for most people the humor is a plus, but for me it is quite off-putting because it is distracting: I'm taking this course to learn, not to be entertained. What are for the instructor simple steps seem like jumps (into the dark) for many of the students. There are far too few easy, stepped problems. If you don't grasp what he's saying, you're pretty much lost (although the book by the same author and free to download is clearer), although some (but not all) of the TAs are a bit helpful. It is not conducive to learning to be told in a sneering tone to go back and watch again or that it was already explained before. The lay-out of the course (i.e., the UI) is not easy to follow, and sometimes Coursera whisks me right out of the course, so I have to start back up again. Some of the GUI is not what I expect. For example, if I click on an exercise name, instead of getting that exercise, I get a canned statement to click on the icon (vaguely intuitive). The instructions on getting started did not work for me, and the forum comments showed that there were a lot of other students who were even more lost. I never was able to get the IDE set up and have been using a work-around. The Autograder has locked up once so far. It was a couple days before I could use it, and even now it doesn't work right (contrary to what TAs said). When i am trying to learn a computer subject, the last thing I need is hassles with the learning program. Because Python is so unforgiving, I lose a lot of time and build up a lot of thought-blocking frustration when I try just to copy a few lines of code from the video (C&amp;P won't work, so I have to write on paper and then type it in). (I don't buy the argument that this is teaching me to be careful when I code.) One example was when I had a capital letter at the beginning of a line (because I had typed up what I'd written on paper using MSW). This brought an error message that gave me no indication of what I'd done wrong. There are a number of slips in the videos. There is a place to report them (if one can find it). But some-times reporting an error is met with a comment that seems to say, "Aw, that's trivial,: don't worry about it." Well, when we're being taught a technical subject where four blank spaces using the space bar are not the same as four blank spaces produced by the tab key (and there is no visual basis for seeing which has been used) and other deadly errors, a course that's been around the block should have fewer errors. Calling a greater-than sign "less than" can really confuse some people (and we can't ask the professor if he menat the opposite, since it's taped). Other problems are that the lessons don't sit with me. I work through the problems and then the next week, I am at a loss to remember either the minutia or the basic concept. The instructor and the TAs have repeatedly said it's okay to be confused: that it will all jell. I hope so, but stuck in lesson 5 after getting correct answers on all the preceding exercises, I don't feel that I am any-where nb ear having things jell. I think the grading is set up so tha tif I don't get the perfect anwer on the exercise, I get a zero. If that happens, I guess it's all down-hill from here. The pedagogy for this course should be fundamentally re-thought. some basic concepts in learning theory should be applied, and the staff should think seriously about the word "everybody."</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>17410</course_id><course_title>Programming for Everybody (Python)</course_title><school>School:  University of Michigan</school><review_data_id>74290</review_data_id><review_date>2015-04-27</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>This was my first MOOC.

I would recommend that Coursera find a way to integrate these chapters in the class, even if they are not graded by the autograder. They could always be completed by peer assessment of some other method of grading. Although I could complete these at pythonlearn.com, it is more fun when you are working in a class with other people. All in all it was a great class and I enjoyed it very much.

It's really something to see that such an important researcher as Sedgewick is also a phenomenal teacher. It's beautiful the way he shows the algorithms operating. Most powerpoint/pdf lectures are just frankly wastes of time to me, but Sedgewick animates his algorithms slowly and without skipping steps on his slides so that you really see how the algorithms work. It can be so hard to look at a piece of code and decipher exactly what the process is that's being executed, but the animations really help to clarify. Part I is a really awesome survey of sorting algorithms and search data structures. I loved the way Sedgewick taught how to do real, industrial-strength implementations of quicksort, for instance. I loved the discussion of the Dutch National Flag problem for partitioning. These kind of critical details are very often left out of algorithms courses where you are usually presented with a simpler quicksort that doesn't perform nearly as well. Another highlight was the bouncing balls in a container simulation (could have just as well been gas molecules in a box) using priority queues. I mean what a cool application that would be impossible to run without such an efficient data structure. The percolation project was pretty difficult, but also really interesting. Sedgewick gives such a clear discussion of union-find. My favorite project though was the one on K-d trees, which are extremely important in 3D graphics. It was by far the hardest project in either Algorithms I or II, but so satisfying once you get it up and running and meeting all performance deadlines. The only complaint I have about the course is the left leaning red-black trees. While the code is really really short for them, it's also much more clever and difficult to follow than the more straightforward CLRS implementation, and it also doesn't perform as well (which is why you see CLRS style red-black trees in the C++ STL, for instance, rather than Sedgewick's left leaning red black trees). Don't get me wrong: the left leaning red-black tree data structure is pretty cool, but I think it would be better taught as a modification of the classic RB trees. To close this review, this comment I made in the review for Part II applies equally well to Part I: Professor Kevin Wayne was EXTREMELY active on the forums. I can't count how many times I'd have a question about something and Professor Wayne would weigh in within a couple of hours to answer me. I don't know how he has the energy, but we'd be fools to not take advantage!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>30</course_id><course_title>Algorithms, Part I</course_title><school>School:  Princeton University</school><review_data_id>2419</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-17</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This was my first MOOC.

Prof. Sedgewick is a very likable teacher and course material is top-notch. Everything is very well-planned and the programming assignments drive the concepts right home.

Frequent use of animations that simulate algorithms step by step made it so easy to understand how they work. I took this course mainly to learn about Java (I knew C++). All the 5 programming assignments were in Java and Coursera submission page gave you detailed feedback as to which tests passed or failed, etc. I found every assignment well thought out and often dealing with an interesting problem of its own, for example, percolation (using union-find tree) and 8 puzzle (using stack for solving a simple AI search problem). On the other hand, quizzes were very boring where you were asked to simulate the algorithms taught in the lecture by hand (e.g., what does the input array "SDHFIENCPV" look like after 5 swap operations in quicksort?). Since it is Princeton University's policy not to offer any kind of certificate in Coursera (at least up to now), it doesn't matter at all if you skip them, though. I believe Part II, which starts in November, will cover chapter 4 through 6 and am looking forward to it.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>30</course_id><course_title>Algorithms, Part I</course_title><school>School:  Princeton University</school><review_data_id>1864</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-04</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>Took this and Algo II, the structure of both courses is identical, and so is my review. Good to excellent lectures, explanation is very clear, examples on spot and in the end you finish your unit knowing it, especially if you try to replicate what he's saying with your own IDE, and test results. I took it as a algorithms and Java refresher, both topics I'm unfortunately not using since few years, and for that, it worked. The weakest point are surely quiz. With the randomization occurring at every attempt, replicating algorithms in pen and paper was an unpleasant, frustrating experience, and I quickly lost interest in completing it - the power of repeatable quiz, is to fix knowledge errors and misconceptions by feedback, not punish those trying to learn. Assignments were quite interesting and I wish I would have tried a couple more... In the end, the lack of any sort of reward or performance measure, even only the honor certification, drained my interest in investing more time than simply watching the videos, and I finished skipping few units, to start different courses. Overall, the very high quality of the lectures will make me consider to check the courses again in the future for improvements.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>30</course_id><course_title>Algorithms, Part I</course_title><school>School:  Princeton University</school><review_data_id>66</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-13</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Really well-done.

Robert Sedgewick speaks a bit slowly but explanations are great and easy to understand. Drilled exercises are a bit boring, but programming assignments and final exams were very engaging and of high quality. Also programming interview questions were an interesting addition to the course, though not enough help to solve them was provided (only small hints, and a not very active sections in discussion forums). Had to google for answers : ) and some still remain unsolvable for me. First part focuses on basic topics like searching and sorting, and also deals with basic data structures -- a stuff, really, every programmer should know. So, if you don't know how to implement a hash table you may consider taking this course :) There's not much math in this course, the focus is on learning about different algorithms and data structures, and using them to solve day-to-day problems, not about developing mathematical models to analyze algorithms and such stuff. Java basics are required if you want to have an output from the autograder but I think programmers in other languages might also find this course useful (if they don't mind some Java :). Finally, there's also a book and an excellent website, so you can really get "it".</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>30</course_id><course_title>Algorithms, Part I</course_title><school>School:  Princeton University</school><review_data_id>7053</review_data_id><review_date>2014-02-16</review_date><review_value>3</review_value><review>15 years of experience with Java development. I would progress on algorithms. I found that the assignment lack of tooling in comparaison with others courses. * No code provided : for example the interface we have to implements and some basic test cases to pass with our first implementations * Others course provide 'submit' mechanism and do not required to do a zip manually with only the assignment class code (and nothing else). I really dislike that I can't respect Java standards : * Unable to do JUnit tests because we can't enrich our code with new methods. We should only have to implements the required interface, and respect this interface why remove errors with new methods ? (in java test classes need to have a default access to method under tests) * necessity to have out class in the default package. This leads to unusual errors as Java has not been design in this way and discourage to do that. * I don't like to have a lot of error due to not respect the course source code standards. Why should I have the same places for brackets, accolade or parenthèse. * Usage of an unknown Java editor in place of classique standard IDE like Eclipse, IntelliJ or NetBeans. It has been quite hard to hand made a 'standard' environment. I drooped this course because I spent to much time to deal with surprising requirements instead of focusing on algorithms.

Turns out I didn't really remember the details of most algorithms, and needed the detailed review to get it (along with basic algebra like exponent rules, which was embarrassing). When I allowed myself enough time, the assignments were fun and the auto grader gave useful error reports. I did feel that the unlimited uploads made it easy to test against the autograder instead of writing proper tests, but that's a problem with my own self discipline.

It covers the lexical analysis, semantics analysis, optimization and code generation ( mainly for MIPS processors ). It covers in detail a number of serious theoretical concepts like finite state automata ( used in lexical analysis ) and parsing of contexts free grammars ( used in semantic analysis ). Some of these topics are quite difficult. Presentation: The lecturer is very competent and things are explained clearly without being dumbed down. Resources: They provide a virtual image of a Linux systems with all the required software ( Bison and Flex, plus a MIPS simulator ) installed. The systems is about 750 MB so you will need a good internet link to fetch it. Coursework: The coursework is option and involves writing as compiler for a minimal object oriented language ( Cool ). It take a lot of time ( for the later tasks about 20 to 30 hours each ) but if you have the time it is very rewarding. There is a choice of C++ and Java frameworks. All coursework is machine marked. Summary: This is a serious academic course for skilled programmers. If your are interested in compilers this course is definitely worth doing.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>22</course_id><course_title>Compilers</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>55622</review_data_id><review_date>2014-09-23</review_date><review_value>5</review_value><review>I expected to learn how to write a compiler, how to use the lexical analyzer, the parser and which algorithms are needed to produce executable code. I was taking this class because I did want to learn about parsing a language and integrates it into my programs. So, producing executable code was not really my goal. Parsing the language was what I was really seeking for. I did abandon this course before reaching my goal. I found the course frustrating. It requires much more time than expected and not enough examples and practical problems were give to make sure you master the concepts required. And partly, the choice to force you to learn a toy language and make a compiler for it was the problem. It is like teaching a language and assuming you are mastering it at the same time. It introduces unecessary complications. This course should be split in two, one part focusing on basic concepts without the COOL language and the goal to write a compiler for it. Then the second part, taught as a second course could have for sole goal to teach you the COOL language and guide you in writing a compiler for it. I found also the fora was not that helpful because that is a lot of extra readings you have to do beside everything else: flex, bison documentation, course documentation, COOL documentation, etc. Too much stuff at the same time. I am still seeking for a good course teaching this material, or at least language parsing. I haven't find anything yet.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>22</course_id><course_title>Compilers</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>35656</review_data_id><review_date>2014-06-17</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>Do you want to know how a compiler works? or do you want to make your own general purpose programming language ? If the answer is yes to the first question and no to the second question then this course is for you. While it gives fundamental of implementing a compiler it feels like the course don't teach you what you need to make  a compiler for a modern programming language. It feels like we are only taught enough to implement the COOL language and the COOL language itself feels a little dated. Also the deadlines for midterm and final exam collide with deadlines for the programming assignments, making following the line with the programming assignments almost impossible for people which is not full-time students. Be aware that have around an equal amount of time to each programming assignments but the workload is more like 1 :1:3 :5.

It helps to understand how the programming languages work by taking you through all stages of writing a compiler, from the code parsing and lexical analysis to the generation of the machine code, and exposing you to the theory behind these stages. The only regret I have is that I couldn't spend more time on this course due to circumstances, and the very last assignment was quite time consuming. I did earn enough credit for completion, but I would still redo this course if time allows.

Its target architecture is a simple stack machine but some advanced topics such as register allocation and code optimization were also briefly covered in the lecture. You can choose to not work on the programming assignments but I think you get the most out of this course by doing them. They are either in C++ or in Java and you are supposed to use Amazon's EC2 (sufficient machine hours were offered by Amazon) or download a virtual machine image and work on your local machine. Either way, you need to have some minimum experience of using Linux. What I liked most was that the programming assignments provided a lot of test cases and gave me instant feedback as to what went wrong. What I did not like was also about the programming assignments: The skeleton code seemed pretty old-fashioned and hard to read. I worked with the C++ code but it was from a pre-STL era with hand-written list data structure, not using "const" anywhere, etc. From the discussions in the forum, Java skeleton code seems more or less the same. Other than that, I am pretty satisfied with the course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>22</course_id><course_title>Compilers</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>716</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Great course.

The content of the course is outstanding. There is a lot of useful information in one place here. 2. The assignments are useful. 3. Unfortunately, the organization of information in the assignment documents is frustrating and incoherent. It requires a lot of brain power just to figure out what they are saying. The first assignment, for example, is not terribly difficult, but the objective in the assignment is unclear which leaves a student fumbling around trying to figure out what needs to be done to complete the assignment. I left 3 starts for the instructor for not tightening up the assignments materials. Each assignment should be concise, have a clear goal, and provide a clear plan for accomplishing that goal. I believe that's what makes the difference between a good instructor and a great instructor. I also find the connection between the lectures and the assignments to be a bit too loose.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>22</course_id><course_title>Compilers</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>33416</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-24</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>The course covered a huge amount of information--highly recommended.

Like other courses on hot topics (the 'Justice' one on EdX being a prime example), this course tackles the hard topic of human morality with good taste, balance and elegance. Other terrible courses (Like the 'Critical Thinking in Global Challenges' one) could learn a lot from this course about how to approach issues with a deep sense of respect for disagreement and opposing positions. The lecturer is an extraordinary communicator that totally got what a MOOC should be. He put together a very thorough syllabus (for an introductory course) that will provide beginners with an extensive overlook on the topic, and simultaneously give the more advanced learner a useful systematization of research done in this area. There is no way anyone can get out of this course feeling like they have lost their time. I absolutely recommend it to everyone - after all, who would not be interested in a competent course on such an important and interesting topic as morality? You should know that the evaluation consists of quizzes, which are very easy if you pay attention to the videos. All the answers are there. They require you to think - but that is a good thing. You should also be aware that the approach followed is that of psychology,not philosophy (although there is also some dabbling in philosophical theories - something for everyone!). Overall, the only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is because the course is much too short. 6 weeks flew by without even noticing. A couple of extra weeks would allow the course to branch into other dimensions that would make it even more awesome. Also, a peer-assessed essay would have been a nice touch given the nature of the course. In any case, a solid course that everyone should check out.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>1177</course_id><course_title>Moralities of Everyday Life</course_title><school>School:  Yale University</school><review_data_id>33762</review_data_id><review_date>2014-05-27</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Great course about ethics based mainly around moral psychology.

This course was enjoyable, entertaining, and very informative. As a novice to the topic I found the introduction to topics and concepts very easy to follow. This is one of the better MOOCs I have come across. It is easy to feel included in the learning process, with very active discussion forums. The course material was presented very well, and we were given many opportunities and pointers to further our knowledge with outside resources.

The professor uses balance sheets of banks and other market participants to explain how money market operations work.  You'll learn about things like the federal funds market, eurodollars, repos and reverses, acceptances, swaps, and bonds.  The over-riding idea of the course is that there is a hierarchy of money with central bank liabilities at the top and many different kinds of credit below that.  The professor also discusses money market dealers, where their profit comes from, and the difference between the inside and outside spread.  Much attention is also given to how all these mechanisms change during times of stress, for example when liquidity dries up like in the last crisis, and how central banks have had to take innovative steps to handle the crisis, mostly by vastly expanding their balance sheets.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>3356</course_id><course_title>Economics of Money and Banking, Part One</course_title><school>School:  Columbia University</school><review_data_id>4641</review_data_id><review_date>2013-12-23</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I was impressed by the quality of this course.

Greer The review below ended up being posted by 'anonymous'. I'm repeating it here to claim authorship! The Economics of Money and Banking (Pts 1 and 2) delivered by Professor Perry Mehrling of Barnard College, Columbia University, and sponsored by the Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET) are excellent, exciting courses at an advanced undergraduate level. They offer a good introduction to money and banking, showing how they have evolved into the global financial system that figured so prominently in the Great Recession in the United States and then in the sovereign debt crisis of the Eurozone - both still reverberating around the world. Professor Mehrling is a distinguished historian of finance and an experienced, highly effective lecturer. He presents a coherent heterodox view of money and banking that is refreshingly innovative relative to standard courses in finance and economics. The course materials, from video lectures, to lecture notes and weekly readings are well organized and easily accessible. As with other on-line courses with massive enrollments, the multiple choice in-video, weekly and final quizzes are best understood as aides to individual learning rather than in-depth assessments grading knowledge acquired across the class. A Certificate of Achievement can be earned. The on-line discussion forums, monitored by a team of talented teaching assistants are also valuable. They permit students from around the world with a great diversity of backgrounds to express their views on many current topics in finance and to contribute valuable sources and references. Greater literacy in the financial issues of our time, from central to shadow banking and financial regulation, is the gift delivered by Professor Mehrling and all the social institutions supporting these courses. A great many students, myself included, expressed their gratitude.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>3356</course_id><course_title>Economics of Money and Banking, Part One</course_title><school>School:  Columbia University</school><review_data_id>3819</review_data_id><review_date>2013-11-13</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>An amazingly great course! With no background in this side of economics and none in finance, I found that Dr. Mehrling made the subject clear and comprehensible. He is an excellent presenter and the decision to videotape the lectures of actual classes was brilliant, yielding a much more dynamic experience that made concentration easy. I looked forward to Sundays when the next set of lectures became available. He produced excellent lecture notes and a wonderful set of readings that gives one a real start on the history behind this material.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>3356</course_id><course_title>Economics of Money and Banking, Part One</course_title><school>School:  Columbia University</school><review_data_id>116831</review_data_id><review_date>2015-12-18</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This was by far one of the best MOOC I have ever taken! The instructor is amazing and explains everything with simple words.

In other words, essential for anyone with a bank account.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>3356</course_id><course_title>Economics of Money and Banking, Part One</course_title><school>School:  Columbia University</school><review_data_id>112134</review_data_id><review_date>2015-08-29</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>One of the best courses that I have ever taken, both with Coursera and live during mu academic life. If I would ever end up a politician, i would make this course mandatory to pretty much most programs in college and university that have to do with politics, economics, finance, accounting. However, with very little background knowledge, I found the course very challenging. For me it mattered more to really understand every sentence and every reasoning, so I tried to go beyond just doing the quizzes, which I found inadequate. I also found that the pace of the course was too fast for me. I bought the book by the instructor and STigum's Money Market, but I was unable to read them at the same time. I would have loved to have had the course spread out over a few more weeks. The subject is complex, and having a solid base is very important, which I found cannot be done in 6-8 weeks. But other than that, i fully recommend the course and will redo it again during the next session to better my understanding of the material.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>3356</course_id><course_title>Economics of Money and Banking, Part One</course_title><school>School:  Columbia University</school><review_data_id>111969</review_data_id><review_date>2015-08-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Amaizing piece of education with an engaging and super intelligent professor.

Was a very easy course to complete/get a certificate. Dislike: No programming assignments to let you implement what you'd read about. A lot of time in the lectures were spent just reading the slides/providing trivial explanations. The quizzes tested stuff that was explicitly mentioned in the lectures - your hearing skills were tested, rather than your thinking skills. The quizzes had the same questions on the second attempt - making it very easy to ace every quiz. Suggested improvements: Add some programming assignments. Make the quizzes worthwhile (or discard them). Overall: A nice course if all you want is an introduction to networks (and a certificate), but you wouldn't want to tell others that you know anything in the field, since you yourself won't be sure!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>35</course_id><course_title>Networked Life</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>53451</review_data_id><review_date>2014-09-05</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>Networked life is a gentle introduction to network/graph theory that covers the basics of network structure, network formation models and networked games. The course consists of 7 weeks of lecture content--typically three 8-20 minute videos per week--with a 8-10 question quiz for each video. The quizzes aren't too difficult and you get 2 attempts, but since there is one quiz for every lecture video, you'll be spending a significant proportion of your total class time answering quiz questions. The course doesn't get into network algorithms or computing: it focuses on basic network structure, formation and games, so you can take this course without any programming or math background. Networked life debuted about 2 years ago, making it among the first courses available on Coursera, so the presentation and slide quality are a bit dated. The lecturer mainly reads directly off slides and you spend the majority of lecture time looking at static slides written in Comic Sans as the lecturer explains them in greater detail. The information is solid and generally interesting but the presentation is often a bit dull when there are no illustrations on the screen. The quizzes are probably the best part of the course; even though they are easy they help reinforce the content and break what might otherwise become a tedious slog through lecture video after lecture video. The course is self- paced, so despite it having "7 weeks" of content, you can finish it faster if you want to. Networked life is an accessible introduction to networks and while the presentation isn't great, the topics are interesting and the frequent quizzes help keep you engaged.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>35</course_id><course_title>Networked Life</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>53445</review_data_id><review_date>2014-09-10</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>A very nice introduction to neworks including social networks, models and economic networks with some game theory. Prof Kearns is really terrific explaining, clear and precise. His only fault is his total lack of knowledge in the field of geography :) There are well designed quizzes to practice the content of each video lecture no programming, exams or any other assignments and the whole material is available from day 1 so you can really go at your own pace. I'd like to say something about the comments mentioning prof Kearns reading long slides. He is not reading, he uses the slides to highlight the topics he explains, the slides are very well constructed because they can be used as a summary of what was discussed in each lesson. A really beautiful course with a great instructor, not difficult at all. Highly recommended.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>35</course_id><course_title>Networked Life</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>469</review_data_id><review_date>2012-11-30</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>I was not sure what to expect from this course, but I ended up really enjoying it. The course takes a mathematical approach to describing and analyzing networks, particularly social networks. Michael Kearns does a good job of distilling a lot of information into a short course. I recommend this course, but there were a few rough spots: \-- The first half of the course, where he lays the foundation, is very theoretical and a bit difficult to follow for non-math people. Professor Kearns presents the information quickly and at a high level, and I found some of it quite intimidating. There was one slide where he put up a very complex equation, using symbols I had no idea existed, and I thought "Oh no!" However, the second half of the course is absolutely worth wading through the first half! When he got into sociological phenomena and real-world applications, I was very glad I had stuck it out. \-- The lecture slides, especially during the first half of the course, are quite dull -- lines and lines of dense text. \-- The quizzes (again during the first half of the course) are tough without the math background to understand all of the equations. However, despite all of this, the concepts are fascinating, and the course is well worth the time. For people who do not have time or energy to brush up on the math, the course is still worth auditing.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>35</course_id><course_title>Networked Life</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>211</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-27</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Well done, Dr. Kearns!

I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. As someone with no exposure on the topic, I appreciate the soft learning curve. The course build momentum as it grows in complexity, which is a perfect teaching strategy. It informs, but it also inspires. You get to understand the open threads quite well. The quizzes are conceptually challenging - you need to know what you're doing. But if you pay attention and follow the classes, it is relatively easy to get the questions right. By the way, the materials are all put online in the beginning, so you're able to do the course in one go. That is excellent. Overall, I could not recommend this course more, as long as this is a topic you find appealing. I've tried other courses in the same area, and ended up quitting - so this one is surely worth a closer look.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>35</course_id><course_title>Networked Life</course_title><school>School:  University of Pennsylvania</school><review_data_id>53397</review_data_id><review_date>2014-09-03</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>This course was my introduction to network science.

Most fun came from the programming assignments. The great thing about them is that there was no single "correct" solution for most tasks, students were free to explore different possibilities; solutions were then graded based on a data unknown to students. Problem sets were quite boring in my opinion; many of them required calculations that are usually done by a machine; performing such calculations with pen and paper is quite error-prone (so for late problem sets I usually wrote small Python scripts; Excel spreadsheets would also fit the bill). Programming assignments were quite time consuming (even for experienced programmers), but I feel that without completing these assignments the outcome would be much less. This is a great course overall and I would recommend it to all people interested in Natural Language Processing.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>15</course_id><course_title>Natural Language Processing</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>1772</review_data_id><review_date>2013-05-26</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Great course - a lot of material covered. If it will be offered again (I wish!) the advice for those who wants to take it is to have the book as well (either the recommended one, or a free Introduction to Information Retrieval, written by Manning et al http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/ and to dedicate quite some time to this course, especially if you haven't been involved with NLP before. Programming experience is a must (the first offering used Python and Java), as well as some exposure to the probability theory. I have been going through Probabilistic Graphical Models at the same time, and these two courses slightly overlapped, though NLP can overlap with almost everything in Computer Science. All the assignments were using English texts as data. If you are interested in the automatic translation, have a look at another, more involved NLP course: https://class.coursera.org/nlangp-001/class/index . For most of the other NLP-relevant topics the course of Zhurafsky and Manning is a great starting point.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>15</course_id><course_title>Natural Language Processing</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>1292</review_data_id><review_date>2015-05-22</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I've taken this course a year ago.

Cons. \- some lectures and assigments are very boring \- very annoying errors in homeworks. Hope in next sessions they all was fixed. Resume: Recomennded for everyone, interested in NLP.

This course covers many topics from Natural Language Processing &amp; Information Retrieval. But comparing with Machine Learning course, this course requires that you spend more time teaching yourselves using the books from authors of this course (I had both books already on my bookshelf, so I had a chance to ready them at the end ;-) But beta-version of both books are freely accessible in Internet, so you don't need to buy them). Some home works were very challenging (especially 4,5 &amp; 6), but some were very easy. Anyway, I'm happy that I had a chance to study this course directly from prominent scientists!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>14158</course_id><course_title>Understanding the Brain: The Neurobiology of Everyday Life</course_title><school>School:  The University of Chicago</school><review_data_id>53384</review_data_id><review_date>2014-09-02</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>14158</course_id><course_title>Understanding the Brain: The Neurobiology of Everyday Life</course_title><school>School:  The University of Chicago</school><review_data_id>43594</review_data_id><review_date>2014-07-28</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>My first Coursera course and the best experience I could have ever imagined with MOOC.

I was hoping we would get some interesting information about origins of life, but it looks like the entire OOL content of the course is about 5 minutes of vague, grade-school level explanation with no supporting evidence. You'd learn a hundred times more just from reading Wikipedia for a bit, which is sad. Worse, the initial lectures are full of factual errors and the quizzes are the worst I've seen on Coursera in terms of grading errors and ambiguous questions. The course seems to have been created to glorify Carl Woese and get him name recognition, and it verges on propaganda. It's interesting that he developed a phylogenetic technique and discovered Archaea, but statements like "before Woese, Biology wasn't even a science" seem ridiculous. The lectures do get better as the course progresses, but it wasn't really what I was looking for.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>12672</course_id><course_title>Emergence of Life</course_title><school>School:  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</school><review_data_id>42636</review_data_id><review_date>2014-07-22</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>This course seems to be aimed at VERY low level. Don't take it expecting to learn much about Carl Woese's work, despite his prominence in the advert. All the references to him covered were the fact that he discovered Archaea and is a Great Man (really, all they managed to do was convey the idea that someone has a chip on his shoulder). It would have been much more useful if, instead of talking about how many grants he was refused, they covered things like horizontal gene transfer or RNAWorld with more than a passing mention. The videos are certainly quite professional and smart, but the content is severely lacking.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>12672</course_id><course_title>Emergence of Life</course_title><school>School:  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</school><review_data_id>50722</review_data_id><review_date>2014-08-17</review_date><review_value>3</review_value><review>This course drew me in with the promise of learning about how life began on earth; instead, it has been a collection of seemingly random topics picked from the first couple of billion years of Earth's existence. Only the first week really dealt with emergence, and very poorly at that. There is no depth to any of the topics. There are three ways to pass the course -- but no option of earning a statement of accomplishment unless you pay. (1) Earn 70%+ on peer-assessed discussion forum posts. (2) Earn 70%+ on peer-assessed "scientific" papers. (3) Earn 70%+ on weekly quizzes (two each week). The forum discussion topics to choose from each week are interesting, but many are not even related to the content for that week. I was initially so concerned about fulfilling the requirements of the discussion post that my posts were not interesting enough for anyone else to respond to -- and I don't blame them. I saw this happen week after week to other people, as well. The three "scientific" papers throughout the course are not scientific at all. In fact, you are not supposed to cite sources. The multiple choice quizzes are probably the most frustrating component. Questions regularly don't make sense or don't have the correct answer in the options. One positive aspect of this course is the students who bring their deep knowledge in various science areas to the discussion forum. They have picked up on countless errors in the lectures and quizzes. I have learned more from my peers than from the professor. This course is lacking quite a bit in quality. I would not recommend it.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>12672</course_id><course_title>Emergence of Life</course_title><school>School:  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</school><review_data_id>43595</review_data_id><review_date>2014-07-28</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>Hands down the lamest MOOC I have ever taken.

I have a lot to say about this inspiring course. 1\. I have BS engineering degree, Basic College Biology, no geology classes. 2\. This was one of the best classes I've ever took, I absorbed information, I got to speak a lot about what I learned and what is important to me, thoroughly enjoyed and had fun with all the material. 3\. What I liked: \- I liked Discussion Forums best (having the discussion board ranking really motivated me to raise my score) \- Video presentations - conversational style lecture in the professional studio with art and music. Small vignette videos. I could watch them many times, stop and take notes. The videos were really excellent \- No text book, all the materials on the website \- Writing the Paper assignments - Especially about Carl Woese \- Peer reviewing other student’s papers - I learned so much reflecting back on my paper. Incredible learning tool. \- Nigel Goldenfeld and Dr Fouke posting in discussion boards. \- Introduction posts, reading real people's comments from every continent was exhilarating. \- Emphasis on co-evolution. Incredible to study evolution from big bang to present. \- The pace and difficulty was very comfortable for me. A lot of material, but not overwhelming. 4\. What I disliked: The "themes of the Course" was incomplete in the Paper Rubric. The transcript on the lectures was not printable, or really readable. Better explanation of "emergence". I think some students thought this meant the bio-chemical process for abiogenesis. This concept is key in evolution, and a more precise definition from complexity science would be helpful. 5\. Suggestions Are weekly live sessions with a TA interviewing one lecturer, or other experts in the field? Let students give instant feedback on the course. Perhaps mp3 file downloads for audio only Maybe a video explanation about the instructions for the papers. Emphasize no references, and what is meant by role play. I was confused about what is meant by role play. It became clearer when I read the other student's papers.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>12672</course_id><course_title>Emergence of Life</course_title><school>School:  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</school><review_data_id>53470</review_data_id><review_date>2014-09-06</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>As others have said, this course has some major problems. It is mis-named since there is very little time spent on the actual emergence of life, and the topics that are covered are done in a very quick way. Factual errors abound in this course, so much so that I have almost dropped it several times. Dr Foulke seems like a pleasant person, and must have some expertise in geology and microbiology, but his knowledge of evolution seemed very thin. The other lecturer that does some of the course is absolutely terrible. Her lectures on plants were the lowest point of the course since she made many, many mistakes. Here are three things that would improve the course in my opinion. 1\. The presenters should take a few MOOCS themselves to see what makes a good one. For example, Intro to Human Evolution on edx with Adam Van Arsdale, Marine Megafauna, Archaeology's Dirty Little Secrets, and the Sports Anthropology course, all on coursera to name just a few. 2. The plant section should be completely reconsidered and presented by someone who actually likes plants, knows about them, and finds them interesting. 3. The course should be narrowed down to deal in detail with the actual emergence of life in a much more rigorous way. There were a few times I enjoyed the lectures, despite the above. The second week was interesting since it dealt with the 3 domains, and I did enjoy Dr Foulke's lecture about the alternation of dominance between the synapsids and diapsids towards the end of the course. I also found a few good resources thanks to others on the forums. One, ironically, was a panel of scientists talking to high school students about the KT extinction event, and dealt with the topic at a much higher level than the course! I hope Dr Fouke finds a way to improve this course. As it stands now, there are far better MOOCs out there.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69</course_id><course_title>Nutrition for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention</course_title><school>School:  University of California, San Francisco</school><review_data_id>1143</review_data_id><review_date>2013-03-11</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>Sadly, I was disappointed by this course. The material was solid, but the take-away message is what most grammar-school children learn in Health &amp; Nutrition class. So, I guess if you never paid attention in school and don't know that you're supposed to fill your plate with whole grains, vegetables, a small portion of protein, watch your fats and sugary drinks and you want to spend 6 weeks learning that, go for it. This is the first course I've taken which the instructor was glued to the teleprompter which made it very disconcerting. Especially as she waited staring at the screen while the page cleared. Awkwaaaard. I enjoy more engaging profs so I found the presentation really boring. Having said that, perhaps Dr. Ferraro has stage fright or social anxiety disorder so other methods of presenting the material just might not work for her or perhaps this is the way the course was designed outside of her control. But, I really would have liked to have heard what she would say if she were speaking to the class more informally as some of the other Coursera instructors do. Alternately, it might have been more comfortable for everyone if she simply spoke over slides as the course I took through Johns Hopkins did. I did like the weeks separated into Health Prevention/Promotion subjects...Diabetes, Obesity, Cancer, Heart Disease, etc. I was disappointed in the week on Gastrointestinal Problems as it didn't feature Crohn's or Colitis, and hopes of learning more dietary support for those conditions was one of the main reasons I initially signed up for the course. I was also disappointed in the week on Obesity as I was hoping Ms. Ferraro would have a better message than the already failed "eat less, exercise more" method. Also very concerned that she featured a segment on bariatric surgery without thoroughly covering the vital facts about lifelong vitamin/mineral supplementation required by many who've had the surgery. As one who works with Health At Every Size in order to encourage everyone, regardless of size, to eat whole, real foods and exercise for fun and enjoyment rather as punishment, I was happy to see that Dr Linda Bacon was featured. Dr Robert Lustig's presentation was also brilliant. It would have been great to have seen the segment on Eating Disorders closely tied to the societal pressures of avoiding obesity as much as control and perfectionism. It would have worked very well with the HAES presentation. I won't say that I felt I wasted the weeks I spent doing this course, but I didn't learn anything new and helpful to me. For those who don't have a clue about how your body processes food, what foods you *should* be eating and the basics of food + disease, I'd recommend this course. For anyone who is already conscious about eating whole foods, or who knows how to search the internet for reliable sources on what to eat for best dietary control of your special-needs diet, you might want to wait for another course to come along.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69</course_id><course_title>Nutrition for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention</course_title><school>School:  University of California, San Francisco</school><review_data_id>1041</review_data_id><review_date>2013-03-11</review_date><review_value>1</review_value><review>This course was a huge disappointment. One of the topics in the lecture was Obesity, The very first line of that weeks first video in the opening statement the instructor made a joke about this topic, I thought is was in bad taste and very unprofessional. I was going to say maybe I was reading to much into it; However, a student made a post on the forums about the very joke I am referring to, The instructor actually commented in this thread and said it was intended. There was also guest speakers on the topic above. One of those guest speakers was subject to verbal attacks on the forums by students, on her character, her weight and how her lecture was only to support her unhealthy lifestyle and finally students questioned her professional credentials, PHD's and her knowledge of the subject of which she spoke. The Instructor did not step in to defend even her own guest speaker whom she choose to have speak. Yes this course was different than I expected. I expected it to be professional and like the courses I have taken so far which, it is not I will not be taking another class from University of California, San Francisco again as it appears that this university approves of this type of unprofessional behavior. To be fair I did learn somethings from this class and for that I am glad as I can walk away not feeling that it was a total waste of time, This class did require more time than the course description stated, the peer assignments were at fault for this, It took me an average of three to four hours for each peer assignment, not counting the weekly lectures and quizzes. I have problem when it comes to peer reviews, you could have someone grading a paper that has less knowledge on the material than the person they are grading or the other way around. A student might be grading a paper of someone who has better language skills than the person grading it and if it's the other way around you can get people who down grade a paper because of poor grammar etc, the point is that in a peer review journal you are being reviewed by peers who have the same understanding and knowledge or close to the same knowledge as the person they are reviewing and I don't think that is possible in an online class.

I enjoyed this course very much. There was a great guest lecturer about fiber. Miss Ferraro had a funny stilted way of talking. One of the other reviewers said it was because she was using a teleprompter. I guess that makes sense, but I wasn't thinking about the reason 'for' her speaking that much. Anyway, the peer assignments were the most time consuming thing in the course, with the final one requiring you to make a recipe and analyze its health benefits (you had to post pictures of it too). One bad thing was that much of the course felt like a laundry list of different organizations eating charts they created, and Miss Ferraro was just going through them all. There was a lot of research data interspersed, but sometimes it wasn't enough between all the eating charts. It's a very heavy data driven course, and Miss Ferraro gracefully avoids falling into the many controversial health areas -- although the forum was full of these!!! Recommended course. Learned a lot.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69</course_id><course_title>Nutrition for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention</course_title><school>School:  University of California, San Francisco</school><review_data_id>1142</review_data_id><review_date>2013-03-11</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>This course has high quality lectures presented by an excellent instructor. In addition, if you watch the lectures on double speed like I did, it really was not that much work per week outside of the peer reviews. I am only giving the course 3 stars however, because it turns out that the material was relatively boring to me. I guess the main thing that I learned is that there really isn't a whole lot of good scientific evidence for how nutrition affects one's overall health beyond things that most people already know (eat your vegetables, keep down the trans-fats, etc). Even questions that I thought would be answered, such as how sugar consumption affects the development of diabetes weren't answered clearly -- not because of the instructor, but because SCIENCE hasn't answered them clearly. There were multiple contradictory viewpoints presented regarding the above question, but for my purposes as a casual consumer that doesn't really help. I am also not sure that this class would be that great for a practicing clinician only because the assignments aren't really on par for a professional. The peer assessments, while fun, were basically high school level -- they would almost certainly be a waste of time to anyone trying to learn the material in-depth. On the other hand, I expect to forget at least 85% of the material I learned in the coming weeks, because I didn't make a very strong effort to memorize the facts that were presented. This is a facts course, not a critical thinking course, which is okay, but be aware that you won't get much out of it unless you try to memorize the material. I would say that this class would be useful to a professional only if you make a stringent effort to memorize the material that is presented and do outside readings (which is otherwise not required) and ignore the peer assessments (voiding the possibility of a certificate...meh). [Also, regarding the other review that said that Katie made a joke about obesity...I have no recollection of this occurring. Everything was crisp and professional as I recall. The forums definitely had some nasty comments however...]</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>69</course_id><course_title>Nutrition for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention</course_title><school>School:  University of California, San Francisco</school><review_data_id>1140</review_data_id><review_date>2013-03-10</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>This course is well balanced and current in the face of all the new research coming available.

The quality of the videos and materials in general was fantastic. It was easy to believe that she was sitting just in front of you, talking to you. I only wished she spoke a tiny bit slower, because it was difficult to make notes and listen at the same time. I loved the fact that all the material in the course was based on research. I particularly enjoyed that the HEAS element was introduced to the course - emphasizing that there are various approaches and that sometimes fighting your body too much makes it difficult to keep healthy. Peer assessments were definitely a bright spot, even though they were very time- consuming.

It's totally unconventional, it's one of the worst and also one of the best. But after all it's definitely worth taking, provided it's offered again. Let me explain why, starting from cons: Cons: The course isn't really well organized. Lecture videos always arrive after their promised release time. What's more unbelievable is the other promised lecturer didn't show up at all. In the end the amount of people who did the final project(which doesn't affect the completion of the course) was shoddy. Pros: Regardless of the video lecture quality, all the resources provided by the lecturer as a seasoned Silicon Valley insider is top-notch. After going through all the readings + course notes you'll have a much much better and more systematic idea of what a startup is about, and, without exaggeration, much deeper insight on the whole world. To gain invaluable insight, experience and information in an organized form from a seasoned and quite successful startup guy is wonderful and will help you form correct notions about many things in the beginning, helping you save unnecessary wasted time. Also the skills he taught are quite useful as well. The cons are probably because the lecturer was just too busy. After all he is not a pure professor, but also the boss of a startup company. So I actually doubt whether this course will get offered again. But for all the resources it's definitely worthy to do.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>340</course_id><course_title>Startup Engineering</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>3033</review_data_id><review_date>2015-05-31</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>This class claims no prerequisites other than an intro-level knowledge of CS, but you'll have a much easier time if you come into it knowing certain things like the Linux command line and emacs. The entire course is structured around using a specific set of tools (Amazon Web Services, linux, emacs, node.js heroku, GitHub) and following along with very long sets of instructions to get a basic crowdsourcing site online using those tools. In the early goings, the course can be pretty frustrating if you don't already have some familiarity with linux, screen, Git and emacs. Otherwise, you'll have to spend a significant amount of effort learning simple keyboard commands to get anywhere. Once you learn those basic nut and bolts, the rest of the course is mostly a matter of following a series of simple steps that are mostly spoon fed to you. Startup Engineering is probably a bit overly ambitious and tries to introduce too many different topics all at once, which can leave students scratching their heads and following along with instructions to complete homeworks without necessarily knowing what they are actually doing. I think the main issue people are having is that the course plays out more like an extended tutorial or series of resources than an actual course. The video lectures are extremely brief and not particularly insightful: all they do is go through the lecture PDFs which are 30-50 page, detailed info dumps on various topics related to the tech stack they are using and business start- ups. They are a useful resources, but they take an enormous amount of time to go through in detail, since they have links to other resources that themselves take hours and hours to look through. It also seems that the main lecturer is likely too busy to make comprehensive video lectures, since they are so short and usually late. In short, there is a ton of useful material here for a motivated self-learner to sift through, but it lacks focus and engaging video lectures. I give this course 2.5 out of 5 stars: below average.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>340</course_id><course_title>Startup Engineering</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>2931</review_data_id><review_date>2013-09-29</review_date><review_value>3</review_value><review>I think this class may have bitten off more than it can chew. It tries to cover everything from awk and sed to the yearly revenue of biotech companies, but it doesn't really succeed in teaching any of it. I've had to go elsewhere to learn how to create a website or start a business. The lecture videos were late and sporadic, so I ended up stumbling through each homework assignment without feeling like I actually understood it. The lecture notes should be in the dictionary under the term 'infodump'. They're filled with lots of great info, but they're in giant PDF files and not structured in a way that allows students to easily digest the material. Concepts should be introduced one at a time, allowing students to master each before moving on. If that means there's not enough time to cover everything, then either make more clear prerequisites, or split some material into its own course. There's a lot of potential here for a great class, but in its first run, it failed to capitalize.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>340</course_id><course_title>Startup Engineering</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>2839</review_data_id><review_date>2013-07-25</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>I'm a software developer who enrolled in this course to get a taste of an unfamiliar technology stack. I am dropping this course even though I've successfully completed other MOOCs and was more excited about this one than any others. We are in week 6 of the course. All the homework was released close to on schedule, but we have only had 2 weeks of videos and 2 weeks where the lectures were released in pdf form. The schedule has been slipped by a week to fix this but I am very doubtful that 4 weeks of video are going to spring up in the next 4 days getting us back on track. The lecture content that has been presented has been good, not very consistent in its granularity, but worth watching/reading. The assignments are what concerns me that this course may not be good even in its second run. I use assignments in MOOCs to hack my brain into thinking it's under pressure to learn stuff. Even though I'm fully aware your grade in MOOCs is meaningless, it gamifies the situtation enough to motivate me. Unfortunately most of the assignments in this course are just walkthroughs. You don't need to understand what you're doing to complete them. And then at the end, all you submit is a permalink to the github commit of your work. You get the marks as long as what you submit looks like a github permalink. It's possible they're going to actually run tests on that stuff down the track, but that gives people no chance to improve if it turns out they made mistakes. So much for Coursera's "mastery learning"! The whole thing is very demotivating. Contrast with EdX's SAAS course, where I just did the assignment for the week on rails. You are told to make some changes to an app you are given, but not how to make them. Then you submit a link to a heroku app you have deployed. Automated tests are run against the app and you are told which ones failed so you know what you still need to work on. That actually involves learning something, and gives a feeling of achievement when you get the marks. You may say this course is designed for self-motivated learners, well sure, if you go off on your own bat and learn node and bootstrap and what have you, you will learn heaps. But you don't need to enroll in the course to do that! I will probably enroll in the second iteration of this course, if there is one, to see whether it's improved enough to bother with. If it has, I will update this review!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>340</course_id><course_title>Startup Engineering</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>28572</review_data_id><review_date>2014-04-12</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course took me a lot of time and effort. But the professor, Balaji S. Srinivasan, is very clear. He actually tells you everything you need to know to accomplish the assignments. You won't come out of this course and be able to start a startup business, but you have your ass covered about a lot of things you do need to know if you do anything at this realm. especially from the tech side. I see some concepts from this course returning. And I do like tutorials. Not less important, I have less patience than most people for things that bore me. I cannot for example complete networking classes when they delved into concepts which can be summed very quickly. This class is very straight-forward given you are willing to put the effort and get the most of it. I don't think you should know Linux to well, I knew it very basically. I recommend this class to anyone who is interested about CS or Startup Engineering (Technically I thought it would be harder you should at-least have one preliminary intro to computing course the best one is MIT's edx 6..00 and Udacity's one is pretty fun also.

New terms and concepts are fired off at an absurd rate, some of which just turn up blank on Google. However if you learn the basics of logic first and persist through the early lectures, I think there is tremendous value in this course and its exercises. The proof editor gives you constant feedback on the valid and invalid ways you can structure a proof. So: great course, but dabble in logic through other sources first or you'll be tearing your hair out. I can highly recommend "How to Prove It" by Daniel Velleman, or "Discrete Mathematics with Applications" by Susanna Epp.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>21</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Logic</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>450</review_data_id><review_date>2012-11-29</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>The instruction of this course is missing a lot of steps for how to understand logic, and do the problems.

Then gave you 3 mozart piece to be preformed on monday. It seemed as if most of the class ( &gt;90%) had dropped out by the 4th week. On top of this, the video instruction seemed almost purposefully confusing. If given a choice between a sophisticated statement you probably wouldn't understand and a simple statement you would, the instructor almost always chose the first. An Example from the videos: "A set of premises (delta) logically entails a conclusion (phi) if and only if every truth assignment that satisfies the premises also satisfies the conclusion" Instead of, maybe "If you can find a single case that would make a statement false, then the statement is false"</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>21</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Logic</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>1374</review_data_id><review_date>2013-04-22</review_date><review_value>3</review_value><review>The professor does not instruct. He simply tells you the rules and then asks you to learn how to use the language yourself through trial and error. There are not nearly enough examples to help you become fluent and comfortable with the rules before attempting the proofs by the third lecture. The result is that in order to really understand the material you need to either find outside instruction or spend an enormous amount of unproductive and non- learning time with the material. I also am frustrated that I can not review old proofs and problems sets that I have done, nor do I get feedback if I do something incorrectly. So there is little opportunity to learn from past mistakes.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>21</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Logic</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>1164</review_data_id><review_date>2013-03-15</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>It was very interesting, but one should definitely have some math (or CS) experience beforehand, as from the very beginning one has to build formal logic proofs as a part of the quizes. Personally, I found weeks 3-5 the hardest because of these logic proofs. While building proofs is the best way (I can think of) to test whether one not only understands, but also applies their knowledge from the lectures, the proof part was the toughest to teach/learn. Another thing I loved in the course was that an approximation of the script of the lectures was available in a .pdf format, so that if one cannot get something from the video, they could always look up the formal definitions in the pdf. :) A great course indeed, he completion of which was lots of work, but it left me proud of myself. :)</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>21</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Logic</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>554</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-06</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>I tried to take this course, but (like many other students who enrolled) I could not finish -- in fact, I could not get past the first few weeks. Other reviewers have done a good job of detailing some of the problems, so here is just a quick summary from my experience: 1\. It was not really an introductory course. A lot of knowledge was assumed, and the concepts were not explained clearly enough for a beginner to understand them. 2\. The lectures were very dull -- mostly just reading the slides, which were unintelligible (at least to a beginner). 3\. The professor tended to choose the most complicated way to explain a concept...jargon jargon jargon. 4\. Not enough feedback was provided for the exercises and quizzes. I was frustrated by not being able to learn from my mistakes. I am currently taking Coursera's "Think Again: How to Reason and Argue" taught by Walter Sinnott-Armstrong. From the syllabus, it looks like the course will cover much of the same ground as "Introduction to Logic," but in a much more beginner-friendly format.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>21</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Logic</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>548</review_data_id><review_date>2013-04-14</review_date><review_value>3</review_value><review>This course, while it teaches many interesting things, has many downsides. The professor just read the slides monotonically. I prefer Salman Khan or Andrew Ng style where they would write on the slides to get the point across. The videos are mostly just incomplete version of the notes. The notes are quite good, but if you've never encounter formal logic before, maybe it's hard for you to try to understand what's the motivation or intuition behind what's taught. The proof-assistance software on the other hand is great, and with the notes, the only positive things about this course. If you haven't encounter formal logic before, like propositional logic, this course really isn't for you.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>21</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Logic</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>264</review_data_id><review_date>2012-11-02</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>I found that the course started off well, but then by week 3 I felt lost (among others, it was apparent in the discussion forum that a lot of the students were lost during week 3) The way it was explained was like the Instructor was reading from a text book.

This course is a series of lecture slides (less than half an hour per week...) with nothing but jargon and practically no examples or training, followed by problems, some of which as absolutely trivial because if you select the correct answer you'll get a check mark, and others are unsolvable by beginners. There is no syllabus ("go check the index of a book", we were told in the forum by a staff member), no information on grading and logistics, nothing. Considering that this course has been offered so many times, and considering that Stanford courses are usually good examples of great MOOCs, I have no idea why this course works so badly every time it opens. Everyone commenting here says the same, and yet there are no changes to the materials and evaluation. I don't think anyone should take this course. The University of Melbourne offers their great two-part course on logic that is one of the best MOOCs ever!

I found that this course was incredibly boring and not taught well. The professor does not teach. He simply reads from the slides which introduce the concepts of logic, but never teaches how to use the material he's presented. He walks through a couple of examples, but never explains why they are how they are. There is also very little feedback when you get something wrong. It seems like they took the full Stanford course and cut out all of the useful teaching bits, and only convey the absolute minimum amount of information needed to talk about the subjects presented.

I would like to know Coursera website. * Evaluation activities: There is a quizz about each topic. However, at the end of the course, there is a final exam, when students can improve their grades. * Good points: \- The course is offered by one of the most important universities of the world on Logic. \- Professor Genesereth made his book avaiable during the classes, in order to students improve their knowledge on the theme. \- The final exam gives a chance to enhance one's score. * Bad points: \- Some subjects are quickly exposed in the video lessons, often requiring much time. \- There are not enough exercises for a Logic course, demanding that students look for additional activities. \- There is a mass evasion in first weeks of the course, since many people have much trouble. * Overall evaluation: In my opinion, "Introduction to Logic" was a very interesting course, albeit I expected it would be easier. Regardless of the name, it goes beyond a mere introduction, proposing proofs from six or seven basic inference rules, when most of introduction to Logic courses usually utilise the double of rules. Therefore, I would recommended it for those who have already studied Logic and want to deepen their knowledge on the subject.

But there were no explanations *why* I should perform this or that substitution, to achieve correct results. Also, getting the only one try for home works/questions is a way too restrictive - you don't get much feedback from your errors, and unable to make corrections. I hope, that this course will be changed in future! P.S.

Luckily this is not the case -- this course is an absolute gem given that you have a very comprehensive knowledge of sentential (propositional), categorical and predicate logic already. Think of this course as a review course and a bit more. Yes, the course does not go into too much detail regarding basic concepts as it assumes that you already have a good knowledge of symbolisation, rules of replacement/inference, proofs, etc. and spends much more time delving into much denser complex concepts that I think aren't typically taught in most "Intro to Logic" courses like Resolution or satisifiability. Tl;DR: This is Logic+. If you already have a good foundation in (formal) logic and high school maths then you will love this. It is a great review resource and gives you a taste of the more mathy side of logic. But you absolutely must have a very strong foundation in logic already. The videos are short and dense because it is assumed that you already know the basics.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>21</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Logic</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>114211</review_data_id><review_date>2015-10-11</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>It's a logic class aimed at computer scientists, so it's not a philosophical logic class. I was already familar with logic so it was more of a review than not. It's based on Herbrand logic so it had a different feel than most mathematical logic classes. I had to spend some time self-learning and working the problem sets on the class as well as spend some time on the discussion forum to get the through the material. It is definitely not a class where you can learn all you need from the videos. They redid the assignment feedback so you get immediate feedback which is a godsend for a MOOC. I'll be honest I dropped it halfway through when I got what I needed out of it.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>21</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Logic</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>59883</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-15</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I'm in week 9 now, so there isn't much to come anymore and the course met my expectation of a rigorous introduction to logic. It challenged me many times, but sticking through it was still feasible, although it probably isn't a good first logic course for the average student, propositional proofs were quite hard and relational resolution was conceptually difficult. But if you want a stanford course that isn't watered down too much, this course is a good example. Personally, I liked the dense presentation, you don't have to watch hours of lecture and you can dive into the problems and experience logic. The amount of information given in the lectures sufficed to solve the problems and the forums were great, especially because of the active participation of the instructors. I'd recommend the course to those people who are interested in formal logic and who can handle some formalism, for those, this course will be fun!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>21</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Logic</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>58609</review_data_id><review_date>2014-10-14</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>I dropped out since week 3 when it did not provide relevant course content for us to finish assignment.

When compering with another courses which were classified as medium it was rather hard one. Already mentioned course "Think Again: How to Reason and Argue" is definitely more friendly for people without previous knowledge, but it doesn't cover the same material.

I am required to speak publicly periodically so this course work is going to allow me greater confidence during preparation, delivery and counter response. I did find that, over the duration, three or four of the questions were ambiguous to me.

You don't know which questions you answered right, which answers you got wrong, whereas you can see your total score, and right answer are released after the deadline. IMHO, this grading system can be ameliorated further, so that a courserian cannot see his/her final score until the deadline. This may significantly diminish the scope of fraud or cheating. 2) Submitting transcripts along with subtitles deserves appreciation. Personally, in previous courses I saw only subtitles. 3) In compare with "Think Again", this course was more practical. Almost all weeks were like a workshop. Negatives: 1) Lectures were too short. Or too much information for 2-minute lectures. It would be better if the lecturers use small smart boards (that is used in several other courserian courses) while explaining something. 2) It is a pity that two courses on argument, namely "Think Again" and "Critical Thinking in Global Challenges" on argument overlapped. 3) In compare with "Think Again", this course was less informative.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>101</course_id><course_title>Critical Thinking in Global Challenges</course_title><school>School:  The University of Edinburgh</school><review_data_id>982</review_data_id><review_date>2013-02-27</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>The idea of the course was excellent, the information was superb, but there was too little.

I appreciated re-learning the tools of assessing evidence and arguments as well as the 5-steps to think about when developing my own arguments. This will most certainly assist me in my other courses of study and my life in general. I enjoyed how your course videos were short and concise with the objectives for the week. I appreciated the resources with each class for further reading and studying. I enjoyed and found the homework and quizzes after each week's assignment to be helpful in understanding and practicing the learning objectives.

I am pleasantly surprised to see how many took this course along with "Think Again: How to Reason and Argue" (Duke). The two courses compliment one another. I found the work-load on this course surprisingly light until I opened myself to the reality that I was only shortchanging myself by 'getting through the course' instead of utilizing the full learning potential, doing all the quizes for all 4 subject areas and participating in the various discussion threads. I found the professors' arguments in the 'correct' answers to the quizes to be particularly useful for learning. The level of work was appropriate for a brief introductory course. While it would have been nice to have a more structured peer-review-of-arguments process, the reality is that it is not feasible in such a brief course. I have seen this work well in courses of 8 weeks and 12 weeks. I look forward to future courses in related areas from U Edinburgh and the professors from this course. Thank you.

In my opinion the main topic "Critical Thinking" was treated really superficially. One might argue that this was only an introductory course and five weeks were not enough time to go more into detail. However, there were only two hours of video lectures - an amount that other courses cover in one or two weeks.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>101</course_id><course_title>Critical Thinking in Global Challenges</course_title><school>School:  The University of Edinburgh</school><review_data_id>7069</review_data_id><review_date>2014-02-18</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>I would advise anyone to stay away from this course. If you want to learn the principals of critical thinking, take the "Think Again" course - that one is a great, thorough learning experience. This course is unbelievably short (10-20 minutes of video per week), with ridiculously simple exercises in the beginning and incredibly... uncritical exercises in the end. You can mount a case against every single answer required in most quizzes. One of the things that the "Think Again" course teaches you is that when you evaluate arguments you should put them in the most flattering form possible. If you want to criticise a position, criticize the strongest possible formulation of that position. In this course we are basically taught (by example) to do the opposite - ridicule opposite positions and summarily dismiss them. You should also be able to identify the problems with your own positions so that you hold them out of reason and not prejudice. Again, this course teaches the opposite, by only providing texts for students to criticize that defend the position the lecturers disagree with (with some honorable exceptions). Particularly terrible in this sense were some one-sided applications to "global challenges". The one on climate change can only be considered acceptable by uncritical individuals who want to hear their preconceptions validated at any cost - which may be fine, but not in a classroom. The lecturer uses terms like "deniers", "stupid" and "dishonest" to qualify either individuals or positions held by individuals who disagree with anthropogenic climate change theories. This sort of application is in fact in contradiction with the very same principles of critical thought supposedly addressed in this course. It is a true mess. Maybe the course will change during future offerings, and if so you may want to check it out. If it does not, forget about it. It's a shame and it makes the great University of Edinburgh look bad - other courses from this institution are pretty good.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>101</course_id><course_title>Critical Thinking in Global Challenges</course_title><school>School:  The University of Edinburgh</school><review_data_id>1310</review_data_id><review_date>2013-04-14</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>An interesting course in terms of format, but not very challenging.

For some reason it is in "Energy and Earth Science" , and "Biology and Life Science" category in Coursera. This is just misleading - there's almost nothing at all from this categories in course (And there is almost nothing at all AT ALL, but more about it later.) It looks more like an attempt to make advanced Think Again course from Coursera with some critical thinking. Sounds great, but the execution is the problem. First of all. Lectures were less than 1 hour / week. There were ALL as long as FIRST WEEK of Introduction To Astronomy. And it's time if you choose ALL the routes they've given. I'm not sure whether this qualifies as a course. There were 4 paths to choose, and I've completed only one route fully - climate change. And while watching this I understood what exactly is wrong with this course. Lectures on global warning were short, it looked like guy who was doing it had never even seen a good course. The speech was not really professional for this type of course. It was too emotional, and he never slows down a little to explain things more deeply. Everything was not TAUGHT it was TOLD. It looked more like TED talk than course, and I think that it was. Probably someone saw some talk on TED, and thought - let's make course out of it. Obviously it didn't work. Exercises for climate change path was frustrating, because it was not enough explained in lecture, and sometimes two or more answers looked that they could be used, but only one could. However those exercises weren't graded. There was final exam - not really connected to climate change path, or any path at all I guess. Exam was very easy, also because it was multiple choice, so I easily got over 90%. I didn't feel that before taking course I would have different score in this quiz. To sum up. It's not a course - it is basically few clips similar to TED talks, with quiz. It shouldn't be on Coursera, and for sure it shouldn't have misleading labels on it.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>101</course_id><course_title>Critical Thinking in Global Challenges</course_title><school>School:  The University of Edinburgh</school><review_data_id>1175</review_data_id><review_date>2013-03-19</review_date><review_value>3</review_value><review>I was really excited to start on this course however I found it quite shallow. I had started the common overlap course "Think Again" also offered by Coursera however I left that one because I wasn't enjoying it and it went into too much detail. This course was the opposite in that the detail was too shallow. If there could be a blend of the two then maybe there would be a course about Critical Thinking and Argumentation that would be interesting to me.

At first glance it seems as though the lessons are short, indeed the videos are a bit shorter than other courses I've taken through Coursera. The difference (for me, anyway) is that having had my critical thinking skills sharpened and mind encouraged, I was ready to take the things I'd learnt to the forums and to the real world. So yes, the classes themselves may have been a bit short, but I was urged to immediately begin applying the lessons and that did take a little extra time in my daily life. Reading news stories took a bit longer, conversations with friends or co-workers took on a new level for me. Like others who have reviewed this course, I also took *Think Again, How to Reason &amp; Argue* and felt that *Critical Thinking* worked beautifully with it. If the *Critical Thinking* team offered an advanced or similar course, I wouldn't hesitate to take it. Pros: Small time commitment for watching videos and doing coursework yet information was immediately applicable to real life. Very personable team. Variety and choice in choosing a "Global Challenge"/or do them all Information easily understandable Cons: The course was so fun I wish it had gone on for a few more weeks Definitely could have stretched the subjects out a bit longer to assure mastery Would have liked more time with the Global Challenge presenters Bottom line: Highly recommended for everyone.

While I found the video content in "Critical Thinking" to be very short in length compared to other Coursera courses I have or am taking (which was both a blessing - since I was enrolled in 3 other courses at the same time - and a curse - I would have liked more in-depth information and discussion or more examples), I did find the Global Challenges assignments quite interesting. Those gave me a chance to dig deeper into a topic, using the basic information provided in the lectures. I was impressed with the look of the videos and presentation of the instructors. Overall, this was a great introduction to critical thinking. If you were to offer a follow- up course, I would be very likely to enroll. Thanks to all at University of Edinburgh!!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>101</course_id><course_title>Critical Thinking in Global Challenges</course_title><school>School:  The University of Edinburgh</school><review_data_id>1032</review_data_id><review_date>2013-03-03</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Great first course for me!

It taught me how to criticize in correct way. About me and personally I like learning to improve my education and my skills, but i want it to be more fun! -critical thinking is one of my favourit subjects but in this course didn't feel the real fun or joy! I felt i'm lost didn't know where to start but i knew where to end so that i like the conclusion results I believe when I feel fun it means I'll get the best score, so feeling fun during studying it's very important to me.

Although I am an Historian who had the privileged of studying during one year in Edinburgh University thanks to Erasmus program, this course has given me many reason to go ahead and study again in the university of Edinburgh , MSC Global Challenges that is gonna allow me to do something useful for the world. Thanks to all you as well for this initiative that allow to a lot of people like me to study these kind of courses which in other way I had been able to take anyway.

My favourite part of the course was that during weeks 3 and 4, we got to choose one topic of interest out of the four global challenges provided. The lectures are a bit too short, so it would be nice for them to be approximately twice as long. But other than that, it is a good course and the quizzes and homework make up for the short lectures. The final exam is important to do as it is a good opportunity to apply what you learn.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>101</course_id><course_title>Critical Thinking in Global Challenges</course_title><school>School:  The University of Edinburgh</school><review_data_id>1020</review_data_id><review_date>2013-03-03</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>An excellent course, which I thoroughly enjoyed.

My opinion is also not objective because I already knew some things, so I got bored every now and then... But I'll try my best to give a review. It was superficial, yes, but it was an introductory course. It was the first course I've ever finished, which was really good to me. I learned a lot and it helped me organize the knowledge I already had and to give it a whole new meaning. It was challenging and motivating. The quizzes and homeworks really helped the information to sink in and the final exam was great. I think the course could be improved if a little more context were provided about the benefits of critical thinking (or even its disadvvatanges.) More of like the way your life changes when you become a critical thinker and how your world view is modified. Something like that.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>101</course_id><course_title>Critical Thinking in Global Challenges</course_title><school>School:  The University of Edinburgh</school><review_data_id>1015</review_data_id><review_date>2013-03-02</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>The course material was clear and the topics selected for engagement very interesting. However, I believe a more in-depth treatment of the material by means of worked out examples in longer video lectures and overall a longer course duration would improve this course significantly. Some of the exercises (quiz or homework) result explanation were somewhat confusing or subject to debate. It left me a little disappointed. Irrespective of this, a big thank you to Celine, Mayank and their colleagues for offering this course. It certainly advanced my knowledge on a number of topics and stimulates to pursue critical thinking and reasoning further.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>101</course_id><course_title>Critical Thinking in Global Challenges</course_title><school>School:  The University of Edinburgh</school><review_data_id>1014</review_data_id><review_date>2013-03-02</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>The course was well-differentiated for learners of many levels with the opportunity for those wanting more of a challenge to access more material and push themselves further if desired (without waiting for a teacher or course structure to do it FOR them--I like this). The videos were an effective length, neither too long or short only highlighting the main and essential points, and I think perfect for a "critical thinking" course--after all, if we can think, we should be able to find additional information on these topics on our own as independent learners. Similarly, the testing format suited learners of multiple abilities and language backgrounds, leaving those wishing to "push themselves" harder in the course with the option to do so on the written aspect of the course. I think this was very well-thought out and delivered in terms of an online course with "no prior background" and a target audience of diverse students with different native languages. I might suggest, from this standpoint, that transcripts of some of the lectures be available as PDF files --not to diminish the value of the note-taking process, but non-native English speakers might benefit from this. I have not taken any other coursera classes, so I do not know how this compares, but I was pleased enough with the experience to (a) suggest it to my own students and get some of them to sign up for courses and (b) sign up for another one.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>101</course_id><course_title>Critical Thinking in Global Challenges</course_title><school>School:  The University of Edinburgh</school><review_data_id>1008</review_data_id><review_date>2013-03-01</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>Thank you!

It is a bit too short, in my opinion, and video lectures are short too. It would be a nice improve to include practical examples within the video lectures, rather than having just the theory. Some things, regarding practical aspects, can only be learned through Homework's feedback, because they are not mentioned in the lectures. Dr Richard Milne's second video was nice, to have examples of fallacies, not just what they are, but how to recognize them. Another nice improve would be to give the professors the chance to write over the slides, as seen on other courses, such as Game Theory, from Standford. All in all, very recommendable.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>61</course_id><course_title>Think Again: How to Reason and Argue</course_title><school>School:  Duke University</school><review_data_id>1113</review_data_id><review_date>2013-03-08</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Yes, the pace of this course is rather slow. Yes, the material is presented in a rather repetitive way. Does that make this course bad? Most certainly not. It is a very thorough course on the theory of reasoning and argumentation. It is also a damn good introduction into logic and probability, so this actually makes the course valuable for pretty much everyone who just starts with coursera. Both Professors Walter Sinnott-Armstrong and Ram Neta are enthusiastic and quite entertaining. If you do have prior knowledge in logic, probability and a bit of philosophy and you just want a quick overview of Critical Thinking the eponymous and more practically oriented course by the University of Edinburgh might be the better choice for you. But if you require more background information this course is just perfect.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>61</course_id><course_title>Think Again: How to Reason and Argue</course_title><school>School:  Duke University</school><review_data_id>896</review_data_id><review_date>2013-04-06</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I have mixed feeling about this course. I find the subject - informal logic - fascinating. The pace of the course, however, is very slow. There is a LOT of repetition - mostly on one of the professor's part - and hours of video to watch each week. Plus, one of the professors developed smart exercises and quizzes - in the sense that the answers are fairly clear-cut and not really open for lots of discussion (this is, after all, a Philosophy class), but the other professor created exercises where he's clearly trying to trick us more than testing our understanding. It's frustrating as hell. I would recommend that future version of this course are shortened. If you keep the contents but remove the repetition you can shave off at least 2-3 weeks of material - that's how slow the course is.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>61</course_id><course_title>Think Again: How to Reason and Argue</course_title><school>School:  Duke University</school><review_data_id>1397</review_data_id><review_date>2013-04-25</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>Interesting course with lots of quirks. The early lectures don't prepare you for the complexity of the first quiz which is much harder than the videos would suggest. Most of the quizzes took me several hours to complete. If you don't get a passing score on a quiz, you don't get to retake the same test (or a very similar test) but instead have to take a different exam that tests slightly different material. The material itself was compelling enough for me to continue with the course although there were several points where I just wanted to call it quits. The professors were attuned enough to the course and the discussion boards to make adjustments along the way to keep the course moving. At the end of the day, I was happy I stuck with it.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>61</course_id><course_title>Think Again: How to Reason and Argue</course_title><school>School:  Duke University</school><review_data_id>551</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-05</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>Dropped this after a couple weeks in.

The videos were mostly crafted for a web audience with videos/humor/gags to keep attention. Including one professor shaving is head and painting it purple at the end because it was "logical." (the mostly is because Ram's share of the videos has some lighting issues) Each lecture contained exercises which were multiple choice quizzes that you could take as many times as you wanted to master the material. The last week was made of up discussion about arguments submitted by students. The course grade was determined by four quizzes. They had a good system for striking a balance on retries. There were four different papers for each of the four quizzes. You could take each one independently and learn from your mistakes before applying those learnings to similar quizzes. This is better for professors than being given the same quiz (or a slightly different) one and X attempts. As you have to actual learn to improve the grade. Parts of the course textbook "Understanding Arguments" were made available online for free during the course. I bought a copy of the book (it's a great book by the way - and written by one of the professors) so didn't try out the online one. And you did need the book to really understand some of the material. Finally, there were not week by week deadlines for this course. For the most part, I was able to stick to week by week. Which is better for participating in the discussion forums. I fell behind for a few weeks but was able to catch up because those were the weeks about logic which I already knew from being a software developer.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>61</course_id><course_title>Think Again: How to Reason and Argue</course_title><school>School:  Duke University</school><review_data_id>932</review_data_id><review_date>2013-02-11</review_date><review_value>5</review_value><review>As other students have stated, this course has an extremely slow pace.

As you'll notice from the reviews, however, appraisals of the course are rather polarizing. Either you love the course or you extremely hate it. I'm giving the course five stars for what I thought was excellent treatment in general from the course staff, even though there were many, many things that went wrong. PROS: \- This is not a fluffy course. The workload is huge - there are many lecture videos, a writing assignment and around 40 pages of reading every week. Videos alternate between documentaries borrowed by the professor for the course and lecture videos by the professor, and the treatment is generally rigorous. Social psychology contains many counterintuitive insights about the human condition, and the professor takes great care to back his assertions up with experimental research and meta- analyses. Much of the pedagogy in this course rests on overturning common sense. The professor assidously provides sources to journal articles, etc. for every single thing he says. This is what I cared most about in the course: it was a relatively difficult course and the content was worth it. \- The professor's style is engaging, with some of the videos having gags or even mini-experiments to keep the viewer engaged. \- There are "bonuses" in the course, like one winning final assignment essay being chosen to meet the Dalai Lama, and nine others being given money to donate to the charity of their choice; small group discussions for extra credit; and documentaries obtained through the professor's connections such as footage of the Stanford Prison Experiment and the Milgram shock experiments. One creative touch was how at the beginning of the course students were asked to complete an ungraded "Snapshot Quiz" with various questions relating to social psychology. Your personal answers to that quiz were then continually brought up in the middle of lectures when that relevant topic was being discussed. CONS: \- Everything in the course is provided for free, but the professor frequently encourages people to become a member of his Social Psychology Network for $10. One of the assignments featured the SPN as well, though there was an alternate assignment available. I completed the course fully without paying a cent, but it was somewhat off-putting. \- Many people on the forums expressed reservations about whether the course or some aspects of the course served the professor in some way. For example, the assignments frequently involved some aspect of the professor's work (for example, being asked to assess the persuasive effect of an anti-smoking website developed by the professor, or being asked to complete and then write about an online interview questionnaire about animal rights developed by the professor). Some wondered whether the entire course was an experiment in social psychology. \- The videos in the course were not downloadable, unlike in most other Coursera courses. This meant that many people could not download the videos for later, they had to have an Internet connection all the time. The professor's explanation was that he made extensive use of copyrighted material and in exchange had to agree not to allow downloading. I'm sure a lot of people dropped the course because of this inconvenience. \- While the professor did not proselytize, there's no denying he wore his more political beliefs on his sleeves - such as the aforementioned assignment on animal rights. This might have sometimes spilled over into the lectures, such as how the professor spent quite a while discussing the literature on how violence on TV affects aggressiveness, then right before the end of the video extrapolates to video games and encourages people to avoid violent media. Many people complained on the forum that the research literature still has mixed results on video games and aggressiveness. I do hope that these shortcomings will be worked on, although not many professors make changes to their MOOCs once they've been released. Even as it is, however, the pros weigh enough for me to honestly recommend this course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>239</course_id><course_title>Social Psychology</course_title><school>School:  Wesleyan University</school><review_data_id>3387</review_data_id><review_date>2013-10-13</review_date><review_value>1</review_value><review>One of the people who commented here said: "During the lectures, I had strong feeling that professor Plous wants to make me non-smoking vegan budhistic pacifist, and to change my sexual orientation into a lesbian transsexual." Precisely why I dropped out. One of the assignments was to be a good Samaritan for a day, and if you were the best choir boy you would get to meet the Dalai Lama. Oh goody! What does that have to do with Social Psychology? Nothing. But it befits the instructor's philosophy. This is not science. It's pure ideology transvestite. I didn't watch many lectures as my patience threshold for demagogy is very low, but it's safe to recommend that you stay away from it - unless you like being mind-numbed by this pervasive post-modern mentality that distorts what should be a neutral enterprise, turning it into a justification for life choices.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>239</course_id><course_title>Social Psychology</course_title><school>School:  Wesleyan University</school><review_data_id>3330</review_data_id><review_date>2013-10-01</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>I had substantial previous experience with social psychology and took this course to see how Coursera would handle the topic. It was my first MOOC experience, although I have downloaded prerecorded psychology lectures from other sources several times in the past few years. I was very interested in seeing how the Coursera MOOC experience would improve on the experience of learning from prerecorded lectures in a solo environment. The videos were well produced and the team had done excellent work in assembling study materials, but I felt that the aspects I was most interested in getting from a MOOC were badly handled -- namely, the use of assignments and the management of the discussion boards. If this had been just a video series I would have considered it near-perfect, but as it was I found it a very flawed and unsatisfying experience First, the assignment structure: There were five assignments, all of which were peer graded, and none of which seemed particularly well thought out or relevant to the course material. The first assignment was to use a random-number generator website to practice making random assignments to hypothetical research groups, but since there was no kind of research component to the course nor any discussion of psychology research methodology, many students commented on the boards that they did not see how the assignment connected to the material. The second assignment requested students to pay for a membership on the professor's own social psychology network. There was an alternate assignment available, but the primary assignment involved paying the professor money, which directly contradicted what he stated in his introductory video that he "wasn't receiving a penny" from the course. The third assignment involved going to a web page designed by the professor and providing him with feedback about its effectiveness. The fourth assignment involved going to an electronic interview website created by the professor and and giving him feedback on the effectiveness of THAT product. (That particular website appeared to be designed to shame students who were not vegetarians or vegans; the professor is involved the animal rights movement. This caused extensive protests on the discussion boards.) The final assignment was not even related to psychology but asked students to attempt to "live compassionately" for 24 hours and then write about the experience. A reward was offered of a trip to meet with the Dalai Lama -- a decent enough offer perhaps but not at all relevant to psychology. The Dalai Lama is a religious figure and a political activist, not a psychologist. I found that the rubrics for grading the assignments generally did not match well with the assignment instructions themselves; often, students were asked to grade submissions on things that had not been specified in the assignment instructions. For example, the largest grading element in the "Compassion" assignment was to asses the "impact" of the student's attempt to be compassionate, but this was not indicated as the main feature on which the assignment would be graded in the instructions. Students expressed dismay on the boards that they were being graded on whether or not they had been "impactful" in their efforts to "live compassionately", and were also not happy to have been involved in a competition to be compassionate (particularly grating, in that there is no way to assess that any of the reported compassionate behaviors actually took place! The award could easily have gone to the most creative fiction writer.) Finally, the multiple-choice final exam was specified to be "closed book", yet there was absolutely no way to deter or detect rampant cheating. The decision to make the exam "closed book" when there was no way to enforce or monitor that policy seems bizarre and unproductive, as it only punishes students who are actually honest. Why was the exam not given open book? That would have leveled the playing field for all students. The discussion boards were also very poorly handled, although it is unclear how much of that was due to the class staff and how much was due to limitations in Coursera's discussion board software. The most alarming feature was that individuals could be blocked from the discussion boards without being informed that they had been blocked and without any information being given from either Coursera or the course staff as to what action had prompted this or what might be done to have it lifted. When an individual was blocked, all threads started by that individual disappeared completely, no matter how popular or on-topic they were, and all posts made by all students on the thread vanished as well. The discussion boards started out as a lively community and by the end of the course were a veritable wasteland. Some of this was no doubt due to the typical Coursera attrition but the opaque and seemingly arbitrary moderation by the course staff no doubt played a significant role as well. (It was also very disrespectful to all student participants to treat their posts like this.) I would suggest that Coursera implement software that allows individual students to choose which posts and posters they want to continue to view and allows them to "ignore" any that annoy them, rather than giving the course organizers the power to censor discussions with all the finesse of a sledgehammer. There was also a significant perceived problem with the professor's political slant, in that there appeared to be a definite political agenda attached to the material that is not warranted by the data alone. Students who commented on the political slant and complained about the distortions in the content were banned from the discussion boards in several reported cases. I don't find this acceptable from a supposed educational platform. In short, the things I had hoped to the MOOC experience would provide that a video/audio lecture series could not -- engaging, relevant assignments and an interactive learning community -- were sorely lacking in this course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>239</course_id><course_title>Social Psychology</course_title><school>School:  Wesleyan University</school><review_data_id>2981</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-17</review_date><review_value>1</review_value><review>For me, this course was a big disappointment. In my opinion, the lectures are not very engaging, and they are loaded with advertisements for books which the students are supposed to read and ideally purchase. What irritated me more than anything else was that it is an obligatory(!!) requirement to complete a profile on a psychology social networking site (another bit of advertising here) for discussion or to submit a personal CV for peer-review. That is objectionable on a number of levels, and (if completed honestly by the student) a serious breach of privacy. Also, the course requires excessive reading (some may like that, others not - I mention this last point just for information).</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>239</course_id><course_title>Social Psychology</course_title><school>School:  Wesleyan University</school><review_data_id>67422</review_data_id><review_date>2015-01-08</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is an exceptional course and I could whole-heartedly recommend it. The course is divided by 6 thematic weeks, with one mid-term break allowing for catching up with the material. You start off with Week 1, in a gentle way that takes you through the course structure and requirements and introduces the basic concepts of the Social Psychology, concluding with fun overview of the basic concepts, which contrasts with what I saw in other courses. You also take your first assignment, easier than other tasks you will have to complete, which helps you understand and apply the principles behind random assignment and sampling, concepts frequently used during the lectures and readings. Weeks 2, 3, 4 and 6 are the challenging ones, full of lectures, readings, assigned videos and assignments. This is the core of the course where you learn about yourself, social impression, obedience, group processes as well as conflict, peace and terrorism. Week 7 is somewhat more light-hearted, with only one small reading and treats us with research about happiness and life satisfaction. It is clear that the structure of the course and its topics were very well thought through, to maximise the potential of the students in order to reach the goal. By the end of Week 6, I was a bit de-motivated by workload, hence the idea of a somewhat lighter week was appealing. The lectures are extremely well designed, with frequent pop-up questions checking understanding. The professor is engaging and almost every lecture contains a humorous element helping recall and review the information. The instructions on what needs to be done at every stage of the course are clear and detailed, something I didn't see on any of the other courses. There is an extensive optional reading list attached to every lecture clip although you might need to have a log-in to academic institutions to view some of them. The readings (approximately 30-40 pages a week, with some weeks having considerably more readings than others) either review or complement lecture material in a coherent way. The exception I found was the first reading in a first week (Introduction to social psychology), which contained a lot of new information (understandable at the beginning of the course). This information was, however, expanded in subsequent video lectures in later weeks. The course benefits from extensive free resources such as the most famous psychological experiments ever done (videos), chapters from the renowned books, supplemental material provided during the catch-up week and the expense-paid trip to see Jane Goodall for the Day of Compassion winner. The Snapshot Quiz taken at the beginning of the course provides us with personalised experience as our initial views are constantly being brought up to our attention during the course itself. At the end, we can compare how much we've learned during the course. The assignments are challenging and well structured. The peer review for most of them worked well and the decision to grade the assignment based on the median (not mean) of the grades your peers provide ensured that the unfairness is limited to the minimum. All the written assignments specifically ask to provide relevant references to at least three social psychology phenomena you had learned during the week (and the weeks before) when the assignment was given. The last assignment, the Day of Compassion, was aimed at synthesising what we had learned in order to do something good for the society. In order to improve, I would prefer that the grading of this assignment did not contain a subjective criterion of an 'impact' that our assignment had on others. The course ends with a final exam (50%) based on multiple choice questions. I found it an exciting way on checking upon my understanding, although it would be fairer to replace it with an open-book paper / tasks instead. The course would further benefit from occasional quizzes or applying the knowledge in smaller open-ended problems that could be incorporated into final grading. The discussion boards were exploding from the range of information (apparently this was the biggest on-line course ever created in terms of its participants), yet they were well managed by the professor and the TAs. I found them helpful, active and engaged. The true 'cherry on the cake' was the Extra Credit Assignment that included on-line study groups where the group of randomly assigned students discussed the pre-prepared topics via Google Hangout. The truly international community enriched the course and provided me with an enlightening experience where my own views were challenged and our cultural differences were exposed. I only regret that the course does not have its advanced version. I learned a lot and applied this knowledge in the assignments. I also found out that I am (occasionally) able to apply it in my daily life, making my personal and professional relationships way better than they were in the past. The workload of this course is bigger than stated on the website. I spent on average 20 hours every week on this course, on top of my full-time job; however I topped it up with optional readings found on Google Scholar thanks to the reference list at the end of every lecture. I would predict that 12-15 hours per week should be enough to do well on this course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>239</course_id><course_title>Social Psychology</course_title><school>School:  Wesleyan University</school><review_data_id>3268</review_data_id><review_date>2013-09-21</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I discovered this course too late to earn a certificate, but found the subject so fascinating that I watched all six week's worth of lectures in just three weeks. Professor Plous is an excellent lecturer, and he has filled his course with so many compelling case studies that I have been talking about them non- stop for three weeks. I appreciated the way in which his syllabus is organized and how concepts build upon concepts. I didn't attempt any of the assignments because of the timing issue, but highly recommend this course content.

The information provided by the course was very interresting for me and I enjoyed the lectures, but what I hated were the assignements. The assignements usually require you to do something almost unrelated to the facts presented in the course. For example, the second assignement required to join (paid!) web site (Social Psychology Network) operated by professof Plous and give a lot of personal information. Unpaid alternatives were also given but this one was preferred. Three other assignemens were also performed on other web sites of professor Plous and, in my view, almost unrelated to the material presented in lectures. All tasks were really weird such as operating random number generator or answering stupid questionaire generated by robotic software. The last assignement was to be compassionate for one day (without analyzing what the word means in the lecture) and write an essay about it. During the lectures, I had strong feeling that professor Plous wants to make me non-smoking vegan budhistic pacifist, and to change my sexual orientation into a lesbian transsexual. On the other hand, my learnig experience with the course was quite good - and I will certainly read a good book about Social Psychology in the future.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>239</course_id><course_title>Social Psychology</course_title><school>School:  Wesleyan University</school><review_data_id>3091</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-28</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>After reading the other reviews I felt I should give my view. I don't mind reading. Actually I love to read and being a teacher (university level) myself, I find it difficult to help people understand a subject if I can't give them stuff to read. The reading provided by this course is very helpful. Chapters from books and article which would otherwise cost a lot of money - here they are for free. Thanks! There are also quite a few clips which usually are not freely available. They are kindly provided by their copyright owners. Thanks again. That's why I don't mind if the teacher does a little bit of advertisement. Fair enough. Nothing obnoxious, IMHO. And no, you don't have to become part of the Social Psychology Network, you can submit your homework also otherwise. And even if you do, there are ways to protect your identity.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>239</course_id><course_title>Social Psychology</course_title><school>School:  Wesleyan University</school><review_data_id>3009</review_data_id><review_date>2013-09-29</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>A fascinating subject matter, brought to life with many great examples and clips. I'm taking the class primarily for the video lectures, which are full of variety and extremely worthwhile. The assigned textbook reading is not quite as entertaining, but it has a lot of interesting material, and you can easily skim it if you want. The biggest weakness of the class is that the lectures and readings do not adequately prepare you for some of the assignments. It's a bit like being given a tour of an art museum and then being asked to sculpt something. We need more instruction in actually using the techniques we've seen demonstrated. That said, most are peer-graded, and you should be able to muddle through without too much trouble since everyone's in the same boat. Another reviewer made it sound as though you have to join the Social Psychology Network, but you do not. You can instead submit a resume or CV, and you do not have to use your real information in doing so. The same reviewer also complained about "advertisements" for other books, but I haven't found anything objectionable. The instructor does make a point of talking about famous psychologists and their contributions, but it was all perfectly on point. All in all, I'd recommend the course to everyone who wonders why people act the way they do.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>239</course_id><course_title>Social Psychology</course_title><school>School:  Wesleyan University</school><review_data_id>55613</review_data_id><review_date>2014-09-22</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>A very light hearted and easy course.

Personally I was relatively unaffected by the sales pitch for the social psychology network, but I can understand others' beef with this. Since I'm liberal, the liberal viewpoints of this professor, like 90% of social psychology people is generally not a problem for me, but I did get annoyed at one weekly assessment that was strongly promoting veganism and trying to persuade me to change. I saw no value in this assessment as it didn't relate to the week's materials. On the plus side, the videos are very interesting and it is clear that the professor is giving you an introductory social psychology class that incorporates views (and videos and papers) from the leading social psychology researchers of the past and today. So in that sense it seems quite comprehensive. However, so far the assessments really suck. So I'd give it nearly a 5 for course materials and nearly a 1 for assessments. I also think if you are in the minority of people checking out social psychology and who have a conservative political viewpoint, you are likely going to dislike a lot of this course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>239</course_id><course_title>Social Psychology</course_title><school>School:  Wesleyan University</school><review_data_id>4290</review_data_id><review_date>2013-12-09</review_date><review_value>5</review_value><review>I went into this course very excited about taking it. I already had extensive experience with social psychology and had hoped this would give me a fresh perspective on the material. Unfortunately, there were several issues with the course. First, there was a lot more work involved than was indicated when signing up for the course. Between the videos, the reading, and the assignments, it was very difficult for more to keep up with all the work on top of my normal schedule, and was ultimately the reason I ended up having to drop the course - the college courses I was paying for had to take precedence. Second, although I am a vegetarian and a non-smoker, I really felt like the "assignments" to review the sanctimonious anti-smoking and pro-vegan websites run by the professor were less about social psychology and more about increasing internet traffic. Finally, the forums/discussion boards were completely out of control. Due to the fact that the grading in this course was done by our fellow students, some of them chose to bully people into giving people good scores regardless of whether they actually completed the assignment or not (I imagined that these people didn't follow the assignment guidelines and were worried about their own grades, but that is just a suspicion). I imagine that this could be a very good course with some refining, but only if the instructor/course designers are willing to listen to feedback. I have taken other courses on Coursera and I know they can be really good, so I have hopes that this one will improve if offered again.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>239</course_id><course_title>Social Psychology</course_title><school>School:  Wesleyan University</school><review_data_id>4175</review_data_id><review_date>2013-12-09</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I wish I had enough time to do the projects in this course. it was very well executed and really makes you thiik about your belief system and how you actually act in the world.

It was marred by very poor organisation and attention to detail. For example: in several different pieces of work, the automatic grading system marked correct answers wrong. In one case this was eventually corrected but the correction introduced a new error! The course team did not make effective use of the Announcements page or the official course forums so students were left in the dark about what was going on. I gave up doing the assignments. The lectures were OK, but not great, in my opinion. Overall problem seemed to be confusion about who the course is for. It's advertised as being for complete beginners, and the lectures do start very slow (but never actually explain what kurtosis is...), but at the end the pace is hugely faster and material is included that seems too advanced for a short intro stats course and wasn't really grounded properly. In practice, a high proportion of students on the course (who were still there a few weeks in) seemed to have taken stats courses before, or even taught them.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>29</course_id><course_title>Statistics One</course_title><school>School:  Princeton University</school><review_data_id>355</review_data_id><review_date>2012-11-08</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>I actually don't agree that this class was "designed to be a friendly introduction to fundamental concepts in statistics". The lecture on descriptive statistics even states that it should be review. That doesn't mean it was a bad course.

I put a lot of time into it and got a lot out of it although the mixed factorial anovas at the end almost killed me. Good class.

However this is the worst class I took on Coursera and here's why: The material is dense but fails to properly cover the basics and merely glancing through them. The homeworks are very easy and don't require a proper understanding of the material. Out of 10 questions sometimes you can do them all mechanically without having to understand much. Also it's not uncommon to have 3 different, yet semantically identical questions such as 1\. what is the covariance between x and y 2\. what is the covariance between x and z 3\. what is the covariance between y and z However even though the homework takes about 10-30 minutes to complete (sometimes less than 10). It may take another 30 minutes to figure out what the format is for some of the answers. It can be so frustrating it feels like a bad joke. Sometimes you have to write integer values, sometimes 2 decimals rounded values, but it won't accept them unless you type them in a particular format (which is not explained). For example in the same assignment an answer needs to be formatted as "0.19" and anther answer needs to be ".19", just because. Also these rules seem to be changing between assignments. The forums have more questions/comments about answer format than for the actual assignment. Here's an example "I feel like every time there was a confidence interval question, there was a different format. I got 8 points from 2 attempts and then lost another 5 trying to guess the format until I came here. Was it so difficult to let us use any format we want and then check that our result is within a certain error range? Coursera does stuff much more complex than this at other courses. I am disappointed." "Quiz 7 Q4 &amp; 5, Q6 &amp; Q7 format" had 68 questions/comments when I wrote this (https://class.coursera.org/stats1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=2180) and there were other parallel threads.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>29</course_id><course_title>Statistics One</course_title><school>School:  Princeton University</school><review_data_id>238</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-28</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>I learned a lot, some of the things were clarified, but many still confusing.

The reason was the coverage of the topics. It starts from very basics and attempts to teach advanced topics through the course. However, as the course proceeds, I realized that the attempt of covering large number of topics is actually a bad idea. Since the course attempts to cover too many topics in 3 months, the lectures were not in depth at all. It is a statistics course, with just a few slides with formulas. Some people may think that it is something good, but I think otherwise. Dr. Conway tries to explain ideas too "intuitively". The statistical methods were not explained in depth at all. The slides are not useful, especially for self-study. Unfortunately, the labs was not good either. I see the difficulty of teaching statistics and programming language for practice at the same time. Since the concepts were not covered enough in the lectures, most weeks, using R to practice concepts discussed in the lecture was like black magic. Just call the function that is asked, find the number in the output and that's it. Towards the end of the course, it became obvious to me. Finally, I realized that I don't learn anything anymore and decided to drop the course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>29</course_id><course_title>Statistics One</course_title><school>School:  Princeton University</school><review_data_id>3682</review_data_id><review_date>2013-11-02</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>Since i do have some familiarity with Statistics, the syllabus looked good.

Anything else was left to the student to find out. That's OK for me as a programmer, it's what I do every day, but for other people it may be more annoying. What was really disappointing was the interactive parts of the course. Quizzes where you wouldn't see if you answered correctly or what was wrong with your answer. Sometimes even the marking was plain wrong. How does that help learning? (I believe that should be the main benefit of quizzes, not the grades) None of the staff were active in the discussion forum, only later I found that there was some facebook group (created by students) where staff replied from time to time. What's the point of having a discussion forum, then? In the end, I've dropped the course after some six weeks because I simply had better things to do.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>29</course_id><course_title>Statistics One</course_title><school>School:  Princeton University</school><review_data_id>209</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-27</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Excellent content and outstanding teacher.

Read into that what you will. I enjoyed the survey of so many related technologies. Prof. Wetherall focused on the technical progression from the 70's through to modernity and properly motivated some of the protocol tweaking among big players (e.g. Google, Amazon). I now feel more prepared to tackle modern material which was my goal for taking the course. I found the carefully worded questions a bit annoying. This could be chalked up to poor reading comprehension on my part but I often ended up misreading questions.

It's a very technical course, getting into network algorithms and data capacity/delay/signal equations. However, the lectures are a pleasure to listen to because the lecturer is very good. I'd want to take more courses from him. The course goes more into the theoretical foundations of networking and how it evolved. So if you have a Cisco or networking certification(s), this course will be much different than the way you're normally used to looking at things. I can't imagine taking this course without any networking/IT background. The weekly quizzes are difficult. They test your conceptual understanding.

Students write procedures implementing key mathematical concepts, and apply these to interesting labs that have you changing the perspective of a photograph, dabbling in machine learning, and writing a simple search engine. The lectures are well-organized and the written materials are superb. Note, however, that this is not primarily a programming course -- the point of the programming is to understand and apply the math; those looking for a Python introduction as such might prefer other options. In fact, because solutions to the programming assignments are not provided and code cannot be shared or posted, your coding skills may not improve much. And if you’re new to Python, expect to turn frequently to external tutorials and resources. Those with no prior exposure to linear algebra may also find themselves playing catch-up given the fast pace and abstract focus of the lectures. The course emphasizes proofs at the expense of explained examples and illustrative applications – great for math lovers but maybe not for linear algebra neophytes. Overall, while the presentation moves at a brisk march and the workload is considerable, those willing to devote the time will find the pieces fitting together into a unique learning experience. The course as given was actually only the first 8 weeks of the12-week course taught at Brown, and a mini-course covering the remaining material is planned. Future versions will hopefully cover the entire curriculum in a single session.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>188</course_id><course_title>Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra through Computer Science Applications</course_title><school>School:  Brown University</school><review_data_id>3073</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-27</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>This course is a pretty good attempt at combining Maths theory with practical programming - I learned a lot about Python comprehensions, and a fair bit about Linear Algebra. It gives a background on the maths and appears to finish where the Machine Learning course begins - though I felt I could apply the learning from ML theory a lot easier than from this course. PROS \- great boot camp which forces you to really write correct Python code \- learning the Maths theory and applying it in code each week \- grader allows multiple attempts with no obvious time limits (necessary though) \- active forums \- fun secondary (still mandatory) assignments - I loved the one on changing the perspective of a photo CONS \- Overly picky autograder, often rejects correct Python code because it needs to be written in a certain way (possibly because they force you to use comprehensions in a certain way) \- lots of homework: 2-3 short programming assignments every week \- lectures could use some more comments around applications of the theory being used, rather than just the maths theory followed by occasional code. The secondary weekly assignments should have been referred to frequently in the videos, to reinforce why this particular bit was useful Overall, I am glad I did this course - it was very challenging and time consuming but well worth the effort.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>188</course_id><course_title>Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra through Computer Science Applications</course_title><school>School:  Brown University</school><review_data_id>2994</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-22</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>This is a course with a lot of potential, which unfortunately it completely fails to live up to. Video lecture quality is mediocre at best. The instructor lectures in front of a large screen, and frequently will be standing in front of the notes on the screen. The lectures themselves are very dry, abstract, and "mathy", which is to be expected for the subject, so I'm not counting this against the class. The homework load is heavy, which would be okay if the instructions were always clear and unambiguous, which they are not. For example, a two-part homework problem would require that you assign values to two python variables, but the variables would not be named in the instructions, so you had to guess which variable should hold which answer. The autograder has a number of problems. Feedback from the autograder was generally unhelpful. For example, there was a four-part problem where the autograder would only respond "Incorrect", without telling you which parts of the problem were wrong. In another case, the autograder would accept an answer of the form "a + b", but not of the equivalent form "b + a". Ambiguities in the homework and problems with the autograder are the sort of thing I expect might get ironed out if the class is offered again. Course staff does not seem to be actively monitoring the forums, and a blanket prohibition on posting code to the forums makes it very difficult for students to help each other. But the absolutely unforgivable sin, the one which prompts the low rating I have given, is that the instructor will not be posting sample solutions to the assignments after the deadlines have passed. If you can't figure out a problem on your own, you are completely out of luck. The way you learn to write better code is by looking at other peoples code, and this class does not allow you to do this at all.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>188</course_id><course_title>Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra through Computer Science Applications</course_title><school>School:  Brown University</school><review_data_id>3162</review_data_id><review_date>2013-09-03</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>I did have some background with basics of Linear Algebra. The promised computer science applications of this course is what I signed up for. Also, I had just started learning Python, so the fact that Python was the language for this course was an added bonus. In a nutshell, the course did deliver on that promise, but failed on almost all other aspects of the course. Pros: \- Rigorous, non-trivial assignments. Makes you think about foundational first- principles of linear algebra. \- It shows the power to Python as especially suited for numerical applications. I am really glad that this course used Python instead of something like Matlab/Octave. \- Good call on splitting the course into two parts. The advanced follow-up course will be offered sometime in the future. I think this was a very good call. Otherwise the fraction of people dropping out of this course would have been much higher. Cons: \- Grader. Oh, the grader. Absolutely ruthless grader. A course which is supposed to take 4-5 hours a week ends up taking 7-10 hrs because you are trying to debug some really mundane grader related issues. In the process, you're learning neither Linear Algebra nor Python. Also, the fact that feedback given when you submit an incorrect answer are absolutely useless. I expect a CS course to be a little more foolproof. However, I think this issue won't be as bad in the next versions of the course. \- Prof. Klein, though very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the course material, is just reading off of the slides most of the time. In fact, I ended up reading the proofs of the lemmas myself directly off of the slides to save time. \- The programming knowledge required to complete the course if ill-advised. Beginner programmers will find it hard to cope with the rigour of the course. So, beware! All in all, I am happy with the course, but I wish I had signed up for the second offering of the course instead of the debut offering. Would have saved me a considerable amount of time.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>188</course_id><course_title>Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra through Computer Science Applications</course_title><school>School:  Brown University</school><review_data_id>2951</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-30</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Prior Experience: Took several linear algebra courses at university and have python programming experience If it is a pure Linear Algebra course, I would not enroll into it in the first place. I am curious to find out how matrices and vectors can be applied to computer science problems. Like: 1) Interesting Labs - Real application of matrix and vector calculation to Computer Science problems. Use dot product to find out if politicians cast same or different votes to a legislative bill. Use matrices to scale, translate, rotate and color scale an image. Instructor even provides python code to display the image in web browser to see the effect. 2) The discussion forum is very engaging. Tons of positive comments from staff and fellow colleagues. When I get stuck, I always find good advice in existing posts. Dislike: 1) Brutal autograder - If solution does not yield the expected result, autograder returns a generic yet unhelpful message, "Sorry, incorrect!". I would expect an informative response from a program written by a Computer Science professor. I never imagine to put Mathematics and Computer Science in the same sentence.

We didn't cover much in the course so I didn't get much out of. As I like programming, this seemed like a good opportunity to actually learn Linear Algebra. And it was. I know a lot more now than when I finished the course in college. I bought the class book so I can read the 4 weeks of material that weren't covered in class. (The book is very similar to the lecture so you don't really need it.) Every week, there were homeworks and labs. The labs were applications of the concepts. Week 1 was a lot of python questions. I think it was used as a combination review and weeder week. Because you really do need to be very comfortable in Python to handle the rest of the course. People were helpful in the forums when you got stuck and they were well moderated. The TAs were knowledgeable and monitored the forums as well. This was the first session of the class so us students also served the purpose of being beta testers for the autograder than analyzes your homeworks/labs for the class and the professor's website. It could stand for some improvement. I also felt like the assignments could have used more detail of the output format and examples. I wound up writing pyunit tests for myself to test and sharing them in the forums. I liked the professor's philosophy of "don't worry if you gets stuck on a question; you'll still pass.' Unfortunately as a computer programmer, I program I can't write is like a puzzle calling out to me. I went back to them until I got them all. Overall, it was a good class though.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>188</course_id><course_title>Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra through Computer Science Applications</course_title><school>School:  Brown University</school><review_data_id>3027</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-23</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course was criticized in the forums for the amount of assignment work. I found the time taken on assignments varied from 10 minutes per week to 8 hours per week!

All the puzzles were solvable, and none were that tricky (once you'd spotted your silly mistake!). If you enjoy puzzles and challenge that you've no idea how to solve (especially if you've had no exposure to Python before) then you'll like this. Sometimes the maths will be clear, but expressing it in Python will frustrate - other times it'll be maths that needs decoding. I loved this course.

The fickle grader forces you to think about the problem the way it wants. Which may result less in expanding your mind and more frustration. If your goal is just linear algebra then a good text on the subject or Gilber Strangs MIT class is will serve you better. That being said this perspective is unique and is a amazing complement to a tradtional class. Final Verdict: I would take this class but prepare by running through Learn python the hard way. Before.

I hope to find more courses that do the same. * Prof and staff were active in the forums. * It seems that most of the grader problems reported during previous sessions have been sorted out. There were still a few outstanding issues, but staff was quick to either fix them or suggest a way around them. * Lots of exercises Dislikes: * Videos. The prof stands in front of the PowerPoint and reads from the slides. I'm not typically one to skip the lectures and read the course notes, but I found there was little reason to watch the videos in the end. * Provided Python modules. I often found them frustrating to work with. As an example, the vector and matrix classes include labels for their columns and rows. This adds extra overhead when creating and manipulating those objects – if you want to multiply a matrix M by a vector v, i.e. M*v, not only does vector v need to have the same number of rows as M does columns, as one would expect, but the labels of the rows of v have to match the labels of the columns of M. There never seemed to be any payoff for this added complexity. Suggestions: * I think there's a missed opportunity for visualisations. There are lots of compelling examples of linear algebra applications in 2-D and 3-D that could be rendered to the screen. * Drop the column/row labels for matrices and vectors.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>13</course_id><course_title>Probabilistic Graphical Models</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>3334</review_data_id><review_date>2013-10-02</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course gets quite diverse reviews. Probably, some students had incorrectly estimated the difficulty and/or practical importance of the course. The course is probably one of the most challenging ones in Coursera both in terms of workload and theoretical depth. I used to spend 15+ hours per week (though it was 9-week long during the first run), and I doubt anyone could complete it successfully without basic Matlab knowledge or without prior exposure to machine learning or statistics (would be very difficult to catch up given the workload). I was a PhD student in a related field while taking the course, still the course gave me a lot of knowledge. It contains several advanced topics that are not always covered by alternative courses or books (like learning of graphical model structure). Comprehensive programming assignments (reminding small research problems) and quizzes help to make yourself really familiar with the topics. Some people even made T-shirts with a caption “I survived PA5” — that was an assignment on Gibbs sampling, was challenging indeed, but the experience was that rewarding. Some PA’s really require figuring out the data structures involved, but this is a compromise between having students developing complex software from scratch and spending reasonable amount of time. Daphne, as Coursera co-founder, made her best to show the capabilities of the platform (it was one of the first MOOCs). Unlike some other courses, you feel like you are really taking a quality graduate- level course comparable (though not identical) to the ones the author teaches at her university. To sum up, prospective students should take into account that the course is quite advanced (vs. introductory), academic (vs. practical), and demanding (vs. laid-back), when deciding whether it fits their goals.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>13</course_id><course_title>Probabilistic Graphical Models</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>1761</review_data_id><review_date>2013-05-25</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>One of the most technically challenging, but also one of the most interesting courses I have taken.

Regarding the prerequisites: some knowledge of probability theory and of programming is a must. Previous exposure to Octave/Matlab might help too.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>13</course_id><course_title>Probabilistic Graphical Models</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>922</review_data_id><review_date>2013-02-05</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course has been by far the most helpful course in Coursera for me. Many people can argue that it is a bit hard, it requires somewhat advanced skills in probability and possibly a few other topics in mathematics; I think really it is nothing extreme. Anyway, hard-difficult is exactly what the material is about. Most importantly, for some of us who, for a variety of reasons- don't get to have specialized (in the field of AI) college instructors like Daphne Koller, the chance to take a course more-less the way it's given at Stanford is highly appreciated (to say the least). I am a graduate student and my background already includes calculus, probabilities, etc, so yet another introduction wouldn't do me any good. On the other hand, "Probabilistic Graphical Models" is a modern AI approach and the concepts are very difficult to read from a book alone (mainly because of the -somewhat inefficient for learning- ways of illustrating graph structures with mathematical formulas). Moreover, the course is not exactly found in every graduate program in existence. So, having the ability to take such a course was literally a blessing, especially for my work and I am very thankful for this. I think people should not get frustrated with the material. It really is somewhat advanced, but that is how it should be. A simplified version is not going to be of any use to anyone really. As far as I have seen, Coursera tries to cover a wide range of backgrounds, ages, languages, etc., so it makes sense that some courses are more difficult than others.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>13</course_id><course_title>Probabilistic Graphical Models</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>446</review_data_id><review_date>2012-11-29</review_date><review_value>3</review_value><review>Lots of math, but few examples of how to apply it.

Although it is advertised as taking 8-10 hours per week, it takes almost everyone closer to 15-20. This course is taught as a Stanford graduate course, and is considered a hard one even at Stanford. To get the most out of the course you should have a fairly good knowledge of probability and statistics. For example, do you know clearly what a marginal distribution is? a conditional distribution? Are you very comfortable with Bayes rule? You should also be comfortable programming in Matlab. There are 9 programming assignments. A structured outline of code is given, but you must be able to understand it an fill in the missing algorithmic parts. The code can be confusing to interpret due to the use of many advanced Matlab features. The programming assignments were the best aspect of the course for me because being guided through an implementation of the techniques makes them much clearer than reading a book or listening to a lecture. There is an active online community for this course. This is helpful for understanding some of the ambiguities in the lectures and homework assignments. I found the textbook, although not required, to be a big help in trying to do the homework. Often topics were only touched on superficially in the lectures and yet the homework questions were very detailed. The book filled in the needed material.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>13</course_id><course_title>Probabilistic Graphical Models</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>461</review_data_id><review_date>2014-01-08</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>This is one of the hardest courses I've taken.

This is one of the toughest course that I have taken so far. Prof. Koller admits that this is a tough one for Stanford students as well. The course page indicates a workload of 8-10 hours per week but expect to spend twice as much. The biggest difficulty I faced with was that the instructions of the programming assignments were poorly written and we had to consult the forum a lot to figure out what we were expected to do. The situation was gradually improved toward the end of the course, though. Please note that I took the first offering of this course in March 2012 and things might be different by now. All programming assignments are in Octave (or Matlab if you can afford it). There were 2 tracks: basic and advanced. Programming assignments were required only for the advanced track. Here is some statistics that I found in the forum: 44,000 students registered, 6,450 students attempted week 1 quiz, 3,070 week 2 quiz, and about 1,100 finished the last programming assignment.

After finishing week 4, I can safely say that I know what are Bayesian Networks and Markov Random Fields, how and when to use them, and why they work. I have a feeling that the course is taught very clearly - What once seemed to me like difficult concepts suddenly seem actually fairly simple - which is definitely a result of the quality of the teaching. This is NOT an easy course by all means - Each week has around 3 hours of lectures which are not very easy - It takes me about 5 hours to complete them. There is a quiz after each lecture which takes me around 30 minutes to complete, and the programming exercises require you implement fully the data structures and algorithms. For me this means that each week I need to spend around 10 hours on the programming exercises, so overall I would say the course requires ~15 hours of work each week, for someone with a similar background as me. I would imagine that for people who are new to computer science or machine learning, this would probably be a VERY challenging course - It does not make any discounts since its an online course, and I would say it is a graduate level Stanford course. My background: I have an Msc. in Computational Biology, and some programming experience in Matlab and R. I have a relatively sound statistical understanding, and this is not the first time I deal with graphical models, but is the the first time I study it in depth. I am doing the course 2 years after it was first run - It is too bad that you can't join it at any given point - it would have been nice to get a Coursera certificate for completing the course, as right now I get my exercises graded, but then I'm told that I don't get an official grade since I'm past the deadline... Though as I'm in it to learn, it doesn't really matter to me.

The good parts are Prof. Ullman and his assistant would answer questions on the forum. The office hours also help. The quizzes and exam are quite difficult for me. The optional problems are difficult too. You should have experience with formal proof, because the course video is structured as a theorem-proof sequence. You should also read the book, because it provides more context and intuition than the videos.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>20</course_id><course_title>Automata</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>28503</review_data_id><review_date>2014-04-09</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>I had no prior knowledge of automata theory, but Jeff Ullman is a great teacher, and with some formal background (especially discrete mathematics), this class is doable. Pros: \- I appreciated the highly structured setup of the lectures, it felt like a university level math class. \- Prof. Ullman and his TA contributed a lot to the discussion forums. \- Very interesting material. Cons: \- As others have noted, Prof. Ullman unfortunately rushes through Week 6. \- I would have liked more (and more challenging) assignments (the first two assignments of Stanford's Compilers class are a great way to practice some more DFAs, regular expressions, and CFGs) . To get the most out of this class, I would definitely recommend additional reading (just like any other college class).</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>20</course_id><course_title>Automata</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>7091</review_data_id><review_date>2014-11-25</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>In fact there are only two good books on automata out there: Introduction to the Theory of Computation by Michael Sipser and the recommended one. So you don't have a lot of options. In the first one all topics are covered and mathematical language is less complicated. It's very well known as very clear and concise text. There are also a couple of good video courses on youtube - especially from Arsdigita. The last one is brilliant. In fact - this is a standard. There are also videos of Henry Lewis from Harvard on iTunes U - and they are much more complete (3-4 month course). So what you get from this course? 1) the emphasis is on grammars and regex, other topics especially TM and complexity are covered in less details; 2) HW is tough and interesting but it's not enough for getting comfortable with main concepts 3) no serious theorems and proofs. In short - 6 weeks is not enough to cover his book AND get a solid understanding of automata. If you really want to understand the subject from this point of view you should read his book. This will give you result but is it what you really need? EDIT: in last offering you'll also get some programming exercises and a LOT of challenging problems with explanations. some of them are really hard.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>20</course_id><course_title>Automata</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>115224</review_data_id><review_date>2015-11-07</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is a great course covering automata and complexity theory, aimed at those who can follow university-level mathematics easily. So, if there's no prior background, this might not be the case for you, since it's more math-oriented rather than computer science-oriented. There are a lot of proofs, and interesting discussion problems that have been posted every week, and solved in the forums. There are two programming assignments as well, so this is a nice combination of theory and practice. Discussion forums were very useful, and professor was active in these as well. I came to this class after finishing the Mining Massive Datasets one, which I extremely enjoyed, and I've put the Automata on my watchlist, and it certainly was not a mistake.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>20</course_id><course_title>Automata</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>113690</review_data_id><review_date>2015-09-29</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>i just started this subject ,the content ,instructor and provider are good they are very helpful to learn Automata</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>20</course_id><course_title>Automata</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>70729</review_data_id><review_date>2015-02-15</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>This course is not for the weak at heart.

Their suggestion, a month before the course began, that participants start networking via various social media was taken up with alacrity by hundreds, and then a few thousand, and it is the G+, FB, Twitter and other conversational spaces that drove the course and made it - for those who participated (!) - one of the most fabulous learning experiences ever had online. Testament to the level of engagement this course has stimulated (which participants report they have not experienced in other online courses they've done) is the fact that these conversations are still going, well after the course has ended, and seem set to continue well into the future. I've not personally ever experienced such an open, welcoming and delightful community of fellows, online or offline, and am enormously grateful to the course team for stimulating our discussions with rather well chosen texts and interesting questions to consider. I found the teachers' presence very real and significant, and appreciated it greatly throughout, along with the exceptional level of contribution by those who chose to engage and keep engaged. I heartily recommend the course, because through it I have found myself part of some genuinely intelligent discussions of far more than the 'texts' (which were good conversations starters) - conversations about pedagogy, educational technology, digital literacy and the role of dialogue and multi-modal representation in learning... and the sharing of resources to maintain ongoing conversation and learning continues beyond the course unabated - brilliant. My criticisms focus on the coursera discussion forums and the mode of assessment (not the task itself - that was great)... I found the 'official' forum pretty chaotic and unpleasant to use - its main value to me was as a point of comparison with other forms of online interaction, which I was thereby able to recognise as infinitely superior in every way, and as a result am now encouraging my students to move their discussions out of the institutional LMS and into more multi-modal social media... I note also that those in EDC mooc who have now joined other moocs are preferring to create multi-modal social networking spaces rather than use the official forums... says a lot. Re assessment - there has been a lot of discontent with the peer reviewing, because peer assessment only works when peers are competent to evaluate, which many in a mooc evidently are not (because they haven't done it before)... so instruction needs to be improved. Otherwise, the very open and free and socially networked flavour of the course was experienced by many as its greatest characteristic. My initial and abiding impression is that the teaching team are paying very close attention to feedback, and putting their and the participants' experiences at the centre of their research, so I expect the course will only continue to improve in its design, resourcing, delivery and modes of interaction and assessment. In any case, I highly recommend it, as is or as it will become, to anyone interested in the role and use of multimodal representation and networked communications in higher education. Whether it's easy or moderately hard depends on prior experience and willingness to engage with other participants. As it happened (typical of online courses at this stage in the mooc phenomenon's development) most fully engaged participants are using the course as professional development, and an opportunity to see education from the learner perspective for a change, as they're mostly educators (predictably, in a course on the topic of online education). Other participants I'm still in conversation with are all finding immediate practical application for tools and discourse shared through this course, and have formed something of a fan club for the course and its facilitators... we consider the course a gift and a gem, and are very grateful for the experience.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>102</course_id><course_title>E-learning and Digital Cultures</course_title><school>School:  The University of Edinburgh</school><review_data_id>1100</review_data_id><review_date>2013-03-07</review_date><review_value>1</review_value><review>Well, if you've attended other online courses - this one is not like them. I wouldn't even call it a course, because there are no lectures at all. There is some material (mostly videos) that you are asked to watch and reflect on and that's about it. Though the provided material is divided into separate weeks nothing hinders you from watching everything at day one. The linked videos were certainly interesting and thought provoking but the whole format of the course was so fuzzy and diffuse that I didn't feel enriched by the experience. The instructors called the format a "student-centered … approach" - I'd call it unguided self-study. Which raised a question in my mind: for such a course - what do I need instructors or an online course platform for? The instructors didn't teach or guide, the platform was just used as a link collection and the discussion took mainly place on various social media platforms. To sum it up I'd like to quote one of the students on the forums: "This course [made] me feel like a lab rat." It obviously was an experiment, frankly for me it didn't work.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>102</course_id><course_title>E-learning and Digital Cultures</course_title><school>School:  The University of Edinburgh</school><review_data_id>928</review_data_id><review_date>2013-02-09</review_date><review_value>1</review_value><review>You probably heard stories about artists that bought a can of sardines, smuggled it into a museum and placed it on a pedestal.

The weekly Hangouts on Air added a very nice touch to the course, providing the kind of discussions academics have among one another. I also felt that the instructors were responsive in reading and commenting on student work.

I found it extremely engaging as an adult learner. I signed up for the class for professional development, to learn about digital learning tools, and to create a personal learning network (PLN). All of those goals and more were met through this course. I found the constructivist methodology extremely life-giving to me. The level of engagement from other students through the forums that were suggested by the instructors (FB, G+, Twitter) was beyond my expectations. I was able to connect with other students and to build relationships. I did find the volume of postings and comments to be overwhelming, especially at first, but I learned to filter the information by focusing on smaller groups. The final assignment, creation of a digital artifact, was a perfect conclusion for me. I didn't want to take a test, or quiz, I wanted to learn digital tools, creating the digital artifact gave me the challenge and task of learning those tools. I was very pleased with the results of my artifact and the meaningful feedback I received. I think the course could be improved by providing time to teach students how to do meaningful assessment.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>102</course_id><course_title>E-learning and Digital Cultures</course_title><school>School:  The University of Edinburgh</school><review_data_id>1132</review_data_id><review_date>2013-03-10</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>This is a great course, although it is very self-directed, so don't expect to receive a lot of feedback/support automatically.

Of course, this is one of the courses which might leave you with the idea of how little you know about the subject after all, but this is better than the illusion of full knowledge :) Prerequisites: some programming experience, math on the undergraduate level.

The lectures are good, but this course has some serious problems. There are bugs in the slides and the quizzes, causing formulas to show up as things like "Undefined control sequence \dfrac" or " Misplaced \", making you guess at the part of the formula that's missing. Despite having a decent background in computational learning theory and a bit of background in ML, I found myself having to crack open a book to be able to do a lot of the quizzes. The material for many questions is only covered tangentially in lecture, if at all. I can only imagine how hard it would be with no background (the course material pointedly did not list ML background as being required). If you go to the coursera forums, you can see multiple highly upvoted threads complaining that the lectures simply don't cover the material needed for the quizzes. The staff have responded by saying they're thankful for the feedback, and will try to make things better next time; here's one exact quote: "Thanks for the feedback everyone (including everyone who votes for feedback threads). We're working out the right balance as we go, and I think we'll have it down better next time we run the course. I agree that there've been some real problems." It's great that they're acknowledging the problems and will try to fix them, but that doesn't help anyone currently taking the course. To summarize, the lectures are great, except for some bugs in the slides, and the overall course would be good for someone with a decent ML background. However, it's billed as a course for people that don't have that background; they say they'll try to make it better next time, but this run of the course has some problems.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>76</course_id><course_title>Neural Networks for Machine Learning</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>386</review_data_id><review_date>2012-11-14</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>I've you've taken Andrew Ng's machine learning course, this provides a great followup. Geoffrey Hinton takes us deep into neural networks, well past the back propagation algorithm that Andrew left off with. The content is more math intensive than ml class and the quizes are more rigorous, but not by too much. Assignments are done in octave (an open source Matlab clone). I've seen some complaints in the forums about questions and assignments being vague and underspecified. I don't feel that way very often, but I do think the learning curve will be steep if you haven't had a decent ml exposure already. The exciting part about this course is the content. Geoffrey is pushing us right to the brink of what's possible in terms of object and speech recognition. The deep neural networks that he is building too are really cutting edge. Over the last 4 years we've seen them make significant advances in many areas of machine learning. Geoffrey is a master of the field which means that he combines technical expertise with a deep knowledge of how these systems work. If you want to contribute to the future of advanced machine learning, this class is a great launching point.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>76</course_id><course_title>Neural Networks for Machine Learning</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>75578</review_data_id><review_date>2015-06-11</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>Hinton is a great researcher but the delivery of this course was unorganized and leaves many holes unfilled.

It's fairly good on a superficial level (reasonable topic selection + obvious mastery of the subject from the theacher), but the complete lack of details and insight makes the whole material useless for anyone trying to throughly comprehend / replicate the analysed topics. The classic approach is something along the lines of 'well, I've put 3 layers, the first one with 6 neurons, the second one with 100 and the third one with 8, trained it and obtained this pattern': no information about how those values (number of layers and their size) were picked, nor about how those pattern emerged. The whole class is weirdly unbalanced, with this huge focus on deriving each error function + these out-of-the-blue experimental results. It's like explaining the geometry of the cylinder for about one hour and then briefly mentioning 'oh yeah, we use those as wheels, to make vehicles move'.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>76</course_id><course_title>Neural Networks for Machine Learning</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>4877</review_data_id><review_date>2014-01-19</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Wow, one of a few truly great classes I've taken on Coursera. Also the hardest from the math point of view and assignments. The quizzes had some hiccups (e.g. some questions were initially ambiguous, but later corrected) and were hard and required lots of thought, but I really learned a lot from them, especially about how to get the learning formulas for networks with arbitrary sequences of different types of layers. Good treatment of both basic and advanced neural network topics, with great insights about how different areas are related and about practical issues and solutions when working with neural networks (mini-batches, many different methods to avoid overfitting, etc.). The lectures and slides were not perfect as at times they seemed to jump into new topics without much preparation or the jargon changed without explanation from one topic to the next... but they were small issues and overall the lectures were great. Programming assignments were great, although runtime was long (good luck trying to do it starting only a couple of hours before the deadline) and I wish there was deep network practical coverage. It's great to see how much neural network have progressed since I studied the basics at the university long ago. The class gives a quick overview of great application results of the last years for deep networks, and points to some good papers for those interested in learning more details. If this class is offered again (and if you have basic math skills like derivation), don't miss it!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>76</course_id><course_title>Neural Networks for Machine Learning</course_title><school>School:  University of Toronto</school><review_data_id>3265</review_data_id><review_date>2013-09-19</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>A great follow on course after doing the Andrew Ng Machine Learning.

Instructors are very good, though recommend speeding up Guillermo's lectures (20%) as he speaks slowly (but don't speed up Luis's). Really hope they follow up at some point with a Systems Programming or Operating Systems course. The biggest downside of this course was that they presented many challenges that were hard, there was a very long hard deadline so you could never discuss the answers or the best way to do something. (E.g., you needed to be able to do some challenges in less than say 8 operations for full credit - but some managed to do it in 6 operations -- what tricks were used?) Also like a normal course, the course work isn't 100% self-contained in the class -- e.g., you can watch the lectures and still have to experiment a bunch to figure it out.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>106</course_id><course_title>The Hardware/Software Interface</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>52590</review_data_id><review_date>2014-08-26</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>The hardware software interface covers computing from the level of the CPU to a low level programming language: C. Course content includes binary logic, C basics, C structs and arrays, x86 assembly, the stack and heap, caches, processes, virtual memory, memory allocation and differences between Java and C. The course consists of lecture videos with periodic in-lecture questions and several programming exercises. The presentation of material is good and the professors are easy to understand. On the other hand, the lectures didn't always cover everything you needed to know to tackle the homework; if you don't come into this course with any C experience, you'll probably need to do a bit of outside reading to tackle some of the homework. I also found myself getting a bit bored with this course due some long puzzle-like programming assignments and the low-level nature of the course. Overall, this is a quality MOOC focused on low level computing--a topic that is not covered in many online courses--but it takes a lot of time and attentiveness to complete all the content.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>106</course_id><course_title>The Hardware/Software Interface</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>2701</review_data_id><review_date>2013-07-06</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Excellent course, rich in contents.

So, it would be hard to cater to the expectations of all these groups. Other reviewers have noted the course's positives for them: practical instruction on how to edit; setting standards for scientific writing in journals; encouraging reflection on their own writing. These are significant successes and I don't want to diminish them in the slightest. My interest was in the content, use of technology, experience of assessment and, crucially, sustaining attention. I also have a research project in scientific writing and I was looking for another perspective. So, my interests are narrow and partial but MOOCs are for everyone, right? The course satisfied my last interest most successfully: I've not edited a scientific journal so it was illuminating to watch the instructor doing the hard yards on the page. I also appreciated watching an American editor at work. My field is English language and it's endlessly fascinating to watch how English differs across the cultures in which it's used. At the risk of sounding churlish, may I be frank about the other points? I found the content very limited. "Good writing" is the high aim but, as the peer reviewing exercise showed, there are many different kinds of writing in the sciences. So it would have been useful to look at writing in a range of journals, from a range of disciplines and a range of genres. The technology is (mostly) pretty good: Coursera has invested heavily in the platform and it's paid off. Two suggestions, though: a video lecture that goes over 15 minutes wastes the potential of online technology. The instructor knows her material and is convincing but anyone talking online, in the same pose, the same manner and, often, reiterating multiple examples is going to lose the audience. Second, one of the flexibilities of online — and a big selling point for the format — is the student's ability to sequence and progress at an individual rate. So, locking down the modules week by week is a disincentive. I'm a big fan of peer assessment and, in this case, students had the chance to get their hands dirty and do some editing. I spent a lot of time on this part and reviewed more assignments than required. But without supporting rubrics or some kind of scaffolding it's a lottery and the risk is a dive to the bottom, rather than the middle. The research I've read on this topic supports this argument. I accept that the embedded quiz has the advantage of immediacy but — forgive me — it's not checking whether I've "understood the preceeding material," it's checking my capacity to remember what the video just said. That said, I'm very grateful to have done this course. My interest was really sustained, though, not so much by the material or the format but by the questions the experience raised for me both as a researcher in scientific writing and as a professional academic. Humanities courses are not immediately suited to online modality. Coursera's Daphne Koller hit the nail on the head when she called MOOCs "data-drive" rather than "hypthesis-driven" learning. So, there's a significant challenge for the Humanities where it's all pretty much hypothesis-driven knowledge. I imagine that an area like this one might be sequenced with, say, this course providing a general introduction and then one or two others that develop by being more specialised. One of the instructor's real skills is technical precision and another more specialised course would provide more scope. This course would then become the pre- requisite for later courses. Thanks for the opportunity to review this course; thanks for the opporunity to *do* course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>150</course_id><course_title>Writing in the Sciences</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>126</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-25</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>Your basic run of the mill course.

It doesn't come naturally, as most people believe - the language and structure of papers are very peculiar, and there are certain expectations that reviewers and editors have that we'll sooner or later clash with. This course is a magnificent piece of work. It explains very clearly all the basics (and even some advanced tricks) needed to write quality papers. More than that, it gives the essentials for quality writing in English. It includes lots of training (writing and reviewing other people's writing), so it's very engaging. The best thing I can say about it is that after taking it I looked back at some papers I had written as a young PhD that were rejected by several journals - and now I know exactly why. They look like school reports and not like scientific papers.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>150</course_id><course_title>Writing in the Sciences</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>444</review_data_id><review_date>2012-11-28</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Professor Sainani is brilliant; she is a genius.

Rather than just grading essays using a rubric, you actually edit the other essays in a mini word processing program.

I am so impressed by this course. Of the 11 Coursera classes and 1 edX course which I actively participated in so far (most of which were in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, NLP, etc.), I think this one might be my favorite. Unlike some of the other courses from Stanford or Berkeley which cover similar subjects (and are great as well), this course takes a much more practical/applied approach and examines the technologies used to actually perform these techniques as well as give a great overview of current methods. Nowhere else would I learn as much about state of the art techniques like HTM. Nowhere else would I get to play around with data on web scale using techniques like Map-Reduce. Nowhere else could I get as complete of a picture of the current methods for having computers simulate intelligence, make deductions, run logic based systems, use collaborative filtering, perform pattern recognition, etc. To get the same value as this course gave, at the least I would have to take courses on Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and then do the hard work of tying the different subjects together. Obviously I think that this class was amazing. The quizzes were good tests of if you had understood the content of the lectures. The homeworks were a little sporadic and seemed slightly poorly planned but they were challenging and most importantly, they actually taught you something rather than merely testing if you could parrot back what the lectures had just taught you. I had a feeling of accomplishment when I finally got my tf-idf calculation running in map-reduce format or when I implemented a Bayesian-net to play doctor at diagnosing disease. In terms of practical applications, this course blows every other course out of the water.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>136</course_id><course_title>Web Intelligence and Big Data</course_title><school>School:  Indian Institute of Technology Delhi</school><review_data_id>208</review_data_id><review_date>2012-11-13</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>[Edit] I have upgraded the rating following course conclusion and recap.

What I liked: 1) The *one* programming homework on map reduce. 2) The professors seemed to have an awareness of both in class and online students. 3) The quizzes had some different answers if you retried them. What I was neutral about: 1) Some of the topics were too easy. That's true in some other courses too (I have a degree in Computer Science), but it is easier to skip to the relevant parts. What I didn't like: 1) The English was poor. There were an excessive number of spelling/grammar issues. Some of which affected understanding or quiz questions. 2) Some explanations were fine. Others I had trouble with. If I hadn't taken the AI class (and learned this already), I never would have understood conditional probability from the lectures. 3) Since the class was offered in person too for grades, homeworks were heavily defended to protect the integrity of grades. To the point where you had no idea why you go a question wrong. (And that guessing/wrong answers were heavily penalized, but I don't care about the grades part.) 4) I was under the impression there would be more hands-on/map-reduce type focus and not so much math/Bayes networks.' Why I dropped the class 2/3 of the way through: 1) MongoDb is offering a class starting tomorrow (https://education.10gen.com) which I'm sure will be more hands on! 2) There was a one week break (school vacation) and I lost momentum. 3) I should have dropped it last week, but was hoping it would get better.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>136</course_id><course_title>Web Intelligence and Big Data</course_title><school>School:  Indian Institute of Technology Delhi</school><review_data_id>106</review_data_id><review_date>2012-11-23</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>This course covers various technologies behind big data companies such as Google and Yahoo. It puts higher priority on breadth rather than depth. Topics covered in the first 5 units include PageRank, basic machine learning, MapReduce, and storage infrastructures (Google file system, BigTable, etc.). There are 3-4 more units left that will be mostly about machine learning. The course is simultaneously offered to some institutions in India but online students will not get certificate. To me, the biggest downside of this course is that the instructor, who is affiliated with an IT consulting firm, is not willing to share the lecture slides with the students so far, claiming copyright issue or something. That led to some students' voluntarily taking screenshots of the lecture video, compiling them, and sharing them for other students. There was 1 programming assignment about MapReduce (in Python). [Update on Nov. 9, 2012] \- The slides were released a week before the final, thus bumping up the rating a little bit. \- The course staff changed their mind to offer certificates to online students. \- There were 2 more programming assignments, one of which offered an interesting insight about how SQL can be used to compute probabilities in Bayesian networks.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>136</course_id><course_title>Web Intelligence and Big Data</course_title><school>School:  Indian Institute of Technology Delhi</school><review_data_id>81</review_data_id><review_date>2012-10-20</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>Very interesting subject and the approach taken by the professor.

Others have complained it was too shallow, and perhaps some parts were a bit glossed over, but to cover them all would make it a 50+ week MOOC. I have a good programming and SQL background, but still found the assignments to be difficult, seeing there was no test data or feedback which made it unclear. I would recommend this course if you wanted a good overview or the topics, but the assignments and exams offer no feedback, so if you are aiming for a certificate you would need to be prepared to work at it. PROS \- gives a taste of most of the topics \- speaks slowly in the starting lectures to allow people to get used to his accent (I had no trouble understanding, even on a smartphone) \- they provide the lecture slides in a single ZIP file to download. Very useful, but not as effective as some wiki pages CONS \- no useful wiki page. I take notes but found it difficult to find where the information was for certain things - kept having to go through the videos \- the assignments need rethinking. They are kind of 'simple' once you *finish* them, but it is quite difficult to know if you are on the right track. You only get a couple of shots and entering a value in the answer but have no way of knowing if you are on the right track. A better approach would have been to give some test data which shows what is expected of that. \- I found the exam was difficult seeing it was so hard to find which video the information was buried. I would advise taking notes as you go. \- Just found out the grading will be on a sliding scale. This is a terrible idea, I would rather know how *I* did against the topic instead of being compared to a heap of other people I dont know.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>136</course_id><course_title>Web Intelligence and Big Data</course_title><school>School:  Indian Institute of Technology Delhi</school><review_data_id>3909</review_data_id><review_date>2014-02-04</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>TL;DR: bad structured, not in-deep course, ask you to solve assignments using tools not explained. I studied Artificial Intelligence and have background in ML/DM methods, as well as intermediate programming skills using Python. My general impression is that the contents of this course are not well structured, they don't really connect (even if the instructor insists in so) and all in all it looks like a bunch of slightly related material, poorly covered. The in-lecture questions are not well-crafted, often they just ask you about random stuff you might have learned somewhere else. The students are asked to do homework using tools not explained in the lectures, at all. For example, perform Bayesian Network inference using SQL, when SQL is not explained in the course... And the last assignment is a data-mining task of a huge file, using tools not explained at all (Orange, Octave...?) you just have to learn to use on your own.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>136</course_id><course_title>Web Intelligence and Big Data</course_title><school>School:  Indian Institute of Technology Delhi</school><review_data_id>3891</review_data_id><review_date>2013-11-16</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>I took some courses in AI and ML in my undergraduate studies, and was curious about their large scale implementations. This course looked very promising for me. Unfortunately the instructors' English is very poor, the presentation format is very disorganised, and on top of that the questions are intentionally worded to try to sneak one up on you. I did find the programming assignments quite enjoyable to solve, even if the timed format was a little quirky (we had to precompute all the database, and 2 minutes to submit the answer to a query presented to us). At the end of the course the instructor had the audacity to peddle a book he just published on the course subject, which looked badly unethical (as if he explained badly on purpose, causing students to buy the book in hopes to get a better understanding and grade). I seriously considered dropping on multiple occasions, because I have better things to do with my time (and you can learn about map-reduce from Wikipedia), but I stuck with it(finishing soon).

If I had one criticism, it would be the discussion forum. It became a bit tedious to read through so many benign posts. (Almost a big data problem in itself.) It was probably due to the wide range of student experience. There were too many students complaining about not knowing how to do something. I expected more from students taking a graduate-level course. Overall, I would recommend the course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>136</course_id><course_title>Web Intelligence and Big Data</course_title><school>School:  Indian Institute of Technology Delhi</school><review_data_id>1934</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-11</review_date><review_value>5</review_value><review>The scope and depth of the class were outstanding and addressed a timely area of interest for IT professionals. Professor Shroff's presentations were well organized, simplified complex material, and interesting to follow. I learned a lot that makes me a better practitioner and improved my understanding of how the world of Amazon, Google, and NSA work. Several suggestions that would have made a good experience awesome: The lectures spent a lot of time using relatively complex mathematics to prove theoretical underpinnings of the techniques covered. I would have gotten much more from the lectures if they provided less formality and more worked examples, showing how to apply the techniques. Potential students should be prepared with strong math, particularly, probability, skills. Each of the homework problems was interesting and well conceived but lacking adequate direction. The discussion board back-filled in many cases but, for example, I didn't benefit from the several hours I spent learning that Mincemeat needs to be patched to deal with UTF-8. A simple note to that effect would not have reduced my learning of map- reduce but would have eliminated substantial frustration. The Distributed File System and NoSQL database sections were of prime interest to me but were given relatively little attention. Expanding coverage of these key technologies and including a homework problem would be be great (assuming that lightweight tools are available). The two guest lectures wasted 20% of the lecture time for me. The topics were obtuse / theoretical, the speakers hard to understand, and their practice of addressing questions from the live audience, which we couldn't hear, was maddening. A process to allow discussion of homework by those that have completed it would be helpful in fully leveraging the learning. I spent substantial time beyond the minimum on the homeworks and would like to have discussed my questions and results. A forum section that could only be entered after completing the homework would address this need.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>136</course_id><course_title>Web Intelligence and Big Data</course_title><school>School:  Indian Institute of Technology Delhi</school><review_data_id>1920</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-09</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Nice course at all.

I have the following suggestions for your course: 1) Slides have too much text. Please add more graphics, animation, movement etc on the slides. Even if you actually take a pen and write stuff (underlining, drawing rough figures) helps break the monotonicity of the slides. It helps me concentrate and draws my attention to the part of the slide or concept you are talking about. Online courses can be made more "interactive" if it isn't just a slide accompanied with a voice. 2) I think the course organization can be changed to better tie up the concepts more tightly. Most of the time I was going through weekly lectures as stand alone units and it was only when attempting the hw questions that I had to think and tie the concepts together. 3) Finally this course needs SQL background. You should add a lecture giving some background about SQL in the first week. 4) Any reason why you used octo.py and mincemeat.py ? There seems to be a mapreduce.py package that is very intuitive and easy to use. Finally please add some more programming assignments that work on real life projects, data analytics, web analytics, big data. The course currently seems too theoretical. Thanks for your hard work. Please take these suggestions as positive feedback. Appreciate you taking time to teach this course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>136</course_id><course_title>Web Intelligence and Big Data</course_title><school>School:  Indian Institute of Technology Delhi</school><review_data_id>1816</review_data_id><review_date>2013-05-30</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>In general, I was not satisfied this course. I think professors English is very hard to understand for non native speakers. May be it was possible to explain some topics in more simply words. He trying to speak slower in the beginning but it didn't work. The problem is what to speak and not how fast. There is a lot of math formulas in this course and a lot of theory. There is a lot of questions without explanations. This is not what I am expected from this course. But can't say that I haven't learn something new.

The homework assignments demanded a level of depth of understanding that could only be gained by expending far more than the advertised 2-3hrs/week workload.

Thankfully, student participation in the forums was excellent and we helped each other pull through. Attention to detail in the math slides in the lectures was also lacking - wrong symbols, confusing fonts, poor explanations ("I'll leave it to you to convince yourself this is correct.").

I was definitely interested in the topic and it was my first class from a non-US university or non-elite university so I wondered what that would be like. I think the later (non-elite) was why I too often found myself sharply disagreeing with the professor's views. I've been in business intelligence for well over a decade and in databases for two decades and try to learn from the best. This professor was definitely not in that category. Still, it was a new area for me, so I persevered until my time constraints were too much. I would take it again if it was offered (to complete the material) and I'd try to ignore the wrong things the professor said. For those with far less experience I am afraid you may be taught wrong things, so be skeptical when something doesn't sound right and watch the forums for discussions on those topics.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>136</course_id><course_title>Web Intelligence and Big Data</course_title><school>School:  Indian Institute of Technology Delhi</school><review_data_id>1956</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-14</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I had very little prior experience with the specific subject of the course but as it turns out, I had LOT of very helpful background (BSc Computer Science and Statistics). This course was similar in many respects to a different coursera course I took. The other course was given by a professor of engineering at Georgia Tech and was heavily math focused (robotics/ control theory). The Big Data course was somewhat less heavy on the math. Both courses were excellent in sofaras they both introduced a LOT of new stuff without being overwhelming. One negative about this course: it seemed to wander slightly off the big data theme here and there which was a little disconcerting... but then again, who am I to say? I'm not the expert! :) I am thinking in particularyl of the very little bit of attention we put on the calculation of bayesian probability (which was very interesting and no doubt related to big data...) and also the very little attention that was given to quatitative symbolic logic. These little diversions were interesting in and of themselves, but given the nature of the course, I cannot help but think that the time might have been better spent focused more narrowly on the subject of Big Data. Hmmm. Having said that, I am reminded that the term "Web Intelligence" also figures in the title of this course... I guess that would explain these "diversions"! :)</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>136</course_id><course_title>Web Intelligence and Big Data</course_title><school>School:  Indian Institute of Technology Delhi</school><review_data_id>1935</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-11</review_date><review_value>5</review_value><review>This course covers some very interesting and trendy subjects, but the materials are not very good (a bit chaotic sometimes, quite boring mostly) and, from my point of view, the evaluation is not properly carried out: the quizzes and homeworks (and specially the final exam) are not a good summary of the contents of the course, and sometimes are very tricky.

He was easy to understand (in terms of accent). It would have been nice if all multiple choice questions (homework, quizzes, in-video) has explanations. A lot can be learned from targeted explanations. I found the material in this course very worthwhile. I had no prior experience in this subject, except I that I know python and I learned sqlite3 in the Intro to Databases course (Stanford2Go). The course took me, on average, 8 - 11 hours per week. I found it useful to transcribe the lectures. There were too many details that I would have lost if I did not do that. The course covered lots of material. Some of it was at a very high level (cognitive science with respect to the way our memory works, overview of big data technologies, Markov models, Graph databases) some of it was in lots of detail, with good examples (Naive Baysian Classifier, Map-Reduce, Logic-deductive, adductive, inductive). At first I was down in the weeds. But after finishing all the lectures I watched the beginning units again. Then I understood the flow of the lectures better and I saw how the dots were connected. I definitely appreciated the lectures on Machine Learning in terms of Information Theory much more. The second pass through the videos is extremely valuable. This is not an easy course to teach in 7 weeks. It might have been easier to follow if it was just a few technologies. (But that is a different type of course.) This course was about where today's technology came from and how it is evolving and the big picture of technologies, big data, and how it all relates to web intelligence and human intelligence. And how human intelligence can inspire research in web intelligence. The lecture material was hard. The multiple choice questions were mostly straight forward. The programming assignments were relatively straight forward. The final was too easy.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>136</course_id><course_title>Web Intelligence and Big Data</course_title><school>School:  Indian Institute of Technology Delhi</school><review_data_id>1866</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-04</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This course offers a very wide range of topics, and with the limited time that means the in-depth explanations are compact. I found myself pausing and working out some things on paper more than once. I consider this good: you need to do more than lean back and listen. There is a good connection to both practical and philosophical considerations. Overall: well worth the time to get a good overview of what elements are involved in web intelligence, how they connect, and what the current frontline is. The programming assignments are interesting, and push you to actually understand what is going on. They are pretty trivial if you understand the general principles, no need for extensive programs. The assignments are in Python, not something I use on a regular base, and the assignments don't take more than 20-30 lines of code,</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>136</course_id><course_title>Web Intelligence and Big Data</course_title><school>School:  Indian Institute of Technology Delhi</school><review_data_id>1862</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-04</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>This was my first coursera participation and I was very happy with it. The scope of the course is vast, which suits perfectly to me because mostly I wanted to know what is going on with information process technology. It is a course that get you on many of the back-of-the-scene technologies being used to support the internet revolution. This make some people feel overwhelmed by the broad scope of topics, or disappointed by the lack of deep in some subjects. I feel the course manage a very welcome middle point between extension and deep. The explanation on videos are done very slow, which is a very nice feature. My first language is not English and I never had problems following the lectures. This is hard a course for beginners because you should have some notions on probabilities, programming, sql, matrices and logic. Personally I liked the excuse to learn a new language (phyton) and get to know some very nice tools like Orange. I really appreciate the effort to create the videos used in class, because they cover no that easy to explain topics. It was not that easy for me to understand all the topics, but I enjoyed the course a lot. Very recommendable if you are interested in know how the information crunch on internet works.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>136</course_id><course_title>Web Intelligence and Big Data</course_title><school>School:  Indian Institute of Technology Delhi</school><review_data_id>1860</review_data_id><review_date>2015-07-23</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>This is a great course, because of its interesting topics and the quality of the most of the explanations. There is a valuable effort in preparing videos trying to be didactic and evolve from slow to fast speed in the speech. This is a suitable approach to the international scope of students for the course, where so many of us don't speak English as primary language. Thanks to this course, I have noticed how uninformed I was about the technology used to deal with data in the web. I am working as database analyst, also with business intelligence, and now I am glad to know about other kind of technologies beyond traditional databases. All the topics have been interesting for me, since I was interested in getting to know about search engines, machine learning, data mining, and how to deal with big data. I have been surprised by the variety of technologies and techniques, as well as the quality of the explanations in the most of the lectures, some of them excellent, that make me remember when I was at University. Another phenomen that has surprised me is the great number of people enrolled in this class, and the quantity of thoughts, doubts and help available in the forums, from people from all around the world learning together, something unprecedented in the courses I've done previously. It's difficult to believe that a great course like this is available for free. However I have found some disadvantages: the complexity for some of the topics, some ambiguities and inaccuracies in the language that difficult the understanding, and finally the way that the extra activities are weighted to compute the final aggregate grade, since they don't really help if you have completed all the quizzes so they don't add any extra quantity to the final score.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>136</course_id><course_title>Web Intelligence and Big Data</course_title><school>School:  Indian Institute of Technology Delhi</school><review_data_id>1859</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-04</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Great course!

On the positive side, I liked that the course doesn't require too much time, it gives an overview of many fields and connects them together, I enjoyed a MapReduce programming assignment and the staff answered in the forum regularly. On the negative side, most of the assignments were multiple choice tests that did not really teach much (no feedback or insight), there were some errata on the material, I feel that from the three programming assignments two of them were a waste of time and I did not really like the approach. Overall I feel that I would have learned more using the time on studying by myself. However, being my first MOOC it is possible my expectations were too high.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>136</course_id><course_title>Web Intelligence and Big Data</course_title><school>School:  Indian Institute of Technology Delhi</school><review_data_id>1749</review_data_id><review_date>2013-05-24</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>it is a very good course... i got to learn actually how web is organized.. how it is not just network of pages linked learned about future of web, the semantic web</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>136</course_id><course_title>Web Intelligence and Big Data</course_title><school>School:  Indian Institute of Technology Delhi</school><review_data_id>1744</review_data_id><review_date>2013-05-24</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Shallow and wide - lots of topics, both some theories and practicalities, crossing across many domains and problems, and even visiting some latest trends like HTM. The flip side, is that you only know what you don;t know after this course. Which for most of my experience, is the best learning you can have.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>98</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Data Science</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>2631</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-25</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I will start with the cons then get to the pros: This lectures are rough, even painful at times. It often seemed that Dr. Howe put minimal effort into preparing the videos, he regularly caught errors in his slides and often seemed as though he was thinking about what to say for the first time. He frequently attempted to cover too much in a hurry. I especially found the lectures on NoSQL, statistics, and machine learning difficult to follow (despite a background in statistics and machine learning). Also, if you only do the required assignments, the workload is very unbalanced. The first assignment is very challenging and time consuming. The second is easier. And the rest of the assignments require little time commitment. Now this can be okay, because there were optional assignments you could use to fill in this extra time. Pros: The class does expose you to the main topics of data science. You definitely do not come out an expert in these topics. But you at least gain familiarity with them. The assignments were pretty much all valuable, the most so probably being the Kaggle assigment. Kaggle is where many a data scientist honed their chops. This class gets you started competing in Kaggle competitions. If you really want to learn how to do data science at home, spend time competing at Kaggle. The forums are great. I personally benefited enormously by two threads, one by the President of Kaggle and another by a Kaggle champion, in which they answered any data science questions the students had for them. Very knowledgeable and willing to help. Thank you to them. Overall: If you are interested in data science, take the course. Despite its shortcomings, you will find value in it. Additionally, you got the sense that one of the main reasons for the issues of the course was that it was rushed to get out. I imagine in future iterations, these wrinkles will begin to get ironed out. Don't expect to become an expert in data science from this course, but do expect to have a better feel for what the field of data science is, and some direction as you embark on becoming a data science expert.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>98</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Data Science</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>3143</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-31</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>If you are familiar with functional, object oriented and parallel programming and if you are familiar with linear algebra, relational algebra and SQL and if you are familiar with machine learning: you will do well in this course else: you will struggle I thoroughly enjoyed the class but my only issue was the title (introduction to) as you really need a firm grounding in mathematics and programming to become a Data Scientist.

You'll be left to figure it out on your own or by posting questions to the online forums. Instructor doesn't assume you know statistics, Python, and SQL, but you really do need to know them because the lectures are so poor. My girlfriend has a PhD and knows (and uses) statistics and agrees that he's a poor instructor. Not worth the trouble unless you already know most of the material, but then why bother with this course? Worst course I've ever taken on Coursera. Coursera should be embarrassed by this offering. The others were far better.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>98</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Data Science</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>1942</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-12</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>This is the third coursera course I've taken. The other two - Machine Learning with Andrew Ng and Calculus:Single Variable - were excellent, so I had high expectations coming into this one. This course is very unorganized. The professor attempts to cover too much material yet also attempted to keep the prerequisites to a minimum. So we end up with a lot of very broad topics that are not detailed enough to serve as a decent introduction for those who have not seen the topic before, but also not in-depth or interesting enough to provide any new insights for those who have seen the material before. The lectures are slightly unorganized. The professor talks as though he were seeing the lecture slides for the first time, with frequent pauses to correct mistakes, or try to interpret what is on the slide. Also the homeworks were not really tied into the lectures. If you're looking to get into the field of data science, I recommend Machine Learning from Andrew Ng. In terms of getting an overview or introduction to data science you'd do better doing a google search.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>98</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Data Science</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>43672</review_data_id><review_date>2015-01-27</review_date><review_value>1</review_value><review>This class should be called: "Introduction to my disorganized world of Data Science and the hidden grading system" This instructor should be ashamed of himself. It is one thing to have a lot of mistakes in the first iteration of a course (assuming he has never taught this before, outside of a MOOC). But I'm taking this course the second time and there are still major mistakes in it. Although the professor is from a world class university in Seattle, a city with the highest reputation for customer service anywhere, this professor shows disdain for customer service. Poor descriptions that make an assignment IMPOSSIBLE to fulfill are corrected by a TA, buried in some thread, but NEVER corrected in the assignment description, even after a week. Other missing information stays missing for months. The "real world" assignment was using this "not ready for primetime" website Coursolv which mostly seemed to be projects looking for people to do grunt work (nothing remotely resembling data science) for free. The big data assignment (using TB size data) seemed to require that you like Linux in order to figure out how to do it. They even warned you that you may not get through the setup/installation if you use Windows. What arrogance. 90% of the world is using Windows, even if this professor apparently dislikes it. The peer review assignments gave no indication (or gave contrary indications) on what rules people would use to assess you, so you could waste your time doing things that actually took points away from you. I got a 56% on one peer assessment, which is FAR lower than any peer assessment I've ever had in the 50+ MOOCs I've taken. The only 2 things I got out of this MOOC was realizing what I've been doing for decades was called "data science" (so I have a title "upgrade") and by having a mandatory assignment using kaggle.com I finally got myself to try out kaggles (which are cool, but you don't need this MOOC to find out... just go there and try them). If you can find another way to learn this material, do so. If you are a true hacker and like trying to solve the unsolvable, there will likely be good students to learn from. Much better experience than trying to learn from this instructor who cares far less about teaching than many of the students do.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>98</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Data Science</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>2665</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-30</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>Background: I am professional software engineer with some academic experience with machine learning and statistics. Positive aspects of the course: The map- reduce programming assignment was one of the highlights of the course. Although it was not challenging at all, the assignment did help explain the map-reduce model and required students to solve several simple problems using the model. Ignoring the ridiculous grading system, the open-ended Kaggle assignment was also great. I plan to return to Kaggle in the future and complete more contests. Negative aspects of the course: Compared to other online courses I have taken, the content in this course seemed to be particularly watered down. For example, the lectures on statistics mostly consisted of interesting anecdotes, rather than useful principles that can be applied in a variety of situations. Not much care was taken in preparing the lectures or assignments; there were numerous mistakes. The assignments were far too easy relative to other courses I have taken. Much more time was spent resolving various technical difficulties and working around mistakes made by the instructors than on actually completing the assignments. Programming skills were supposedly a prerequisite of the course, but all of the required programming tasks were trivial. The Tableau visualization assignment was also disastrous. The instructions for the assignment were not clear and the Tableau site did not function properly. The assignment also required students to download and register for proprietary software that only runs on Windows. For the most part, the actual assignment only consisted of copying visualizations that were given to you. Even though the assignment was extremely basic and required no skill, many students received grades that did not make sense because of the dysfunctional peer-review system. I would not recommend this course to someone else. For now, I would suggest taking courses on the various topics covered in the course (Machine Learning, Statistics, Software Engineering, NoSQL, etc.).</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>98</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Data Science</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>2609</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-23</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I will begin by saying that the content of the course is exactly what I was hoping it would be: \- basic python coding for data analysis (I had to learn Python, which wasn't bad as I have been coding for 20+ years) \- a MapReduce introduction with a project in Python \- a NoSQL/big data introduction and optional project \- information visualization (we used a temporary license for the commercial product called Tableu) \- basics of machine learning \- basics of statistical analysis \- Kaggle.com competition site project (quite challenging and a bit of a disconnect from the material presented, but very interesting) I was particularly interested in the Kaggle portion of the course and the big data (project was on Amazon Web Services platform) portion but would like to have had more time focused on just these areas. The course did require of good deal of trolling the discussion forums and just figuring things out on your own. But I would say that it is a good curriculum and course structure for learning about these interesting areas of data science. I would hope that the course will improve as it is offered in the future but I appreciate the effort that professor Howe put into the course and look forward to future course offerings from him and his group at UW. BTW, this was my first MOOC but based on this experience and the feedback I have found on coursetalk.org, I have already signed up for 3 more courses over the next 6 months.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>98</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Data Science</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>43607</review_data_id><review_date>2015-07-16</review_date><review_value>2</review_value><review>Before I took this course I had enrolled to some similar ones such as Computing for Data Analysis, Learn to Program: The Fundamentals and Getting and Cleaning Data at Coursera. All of these were well organized, easy to catch up and with very good teachers. On the contrary, Intro to Data Science lacks all of these attributes. It is a course with too many and too long video lectures, which are badly build up and (sorry) very poorly explained by the professor. In addition, there is little connection between the lectures and the projects. The former is basicaly theoretical stuff and the later is very practical. To summarize, if you do not have a degree in Computer Science or a lot of experience programming do not enroll this course. And if you do, I am sure you will get bored during the lectures. Bad course.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>98</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Data Science</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>3258</review_data_id><review_date>2013-09-19</review_date><review_value>9</review_value><review>Fantastic course, but there are some week points: Good: Bill Howe is knowledgeable and his insight is worth taking the course just for this alone. I understood more about database theory then ever before. I got into the internals of Big data and I loved it. Very flexible course and assignment structure. If you have a Big data project and want to run with it as a part of the course you can do this! Bad: The assignment workload is crazy. I found myself spending hours just getting my python programs to compile. However once done I found my programming skills were pushed to the limit (amatuer C++ programmer delving into Python). Allot of breath, with a fair bit of depth. This is not an easy course. Cecillia Aragon's lectures on visualisation are fantastic too. I loved them and the content within.

However, I did enjoy it quite a lot. It was a nice blend of theoretical models and practice, but it should say that it requires previous experience in Python and SQL, otherwise it could be tough for a beginner. The Tableau visualization was fun, but other assignments could be improved by adding tutorials and more time to grasp these concepts. Kaggle competition was a huge deal, and it should stay mandatory. I'd recommend this course if you want a nice introduction as a programmer.

Instead, the course acts as more of a data science sampler that introduces new topics each week that often have little to do with material covered in previous weeks. Lecture topics include relational databases, relational algebra, SQL, MapReduce, No SQL, miscellaneous topics in statistics, machine learning, visualization and graph analytics. If that sounds like a disjointed smorgasbord of topics, it is. To make matters even more complicated, the programming assignments use three different languages: Python, R and SQL. This course is best suited for those who have some exposure to Python, R, SQL and statistics. If you have the appropriate background knowledge, this course touches on many interesting topics and while the lecturer's delivery is not great, he is quite knowledgeable and the material usually isn't too hard to grasp. Although the homework assignments require different languages and may take you a while to complete, they are rewarding. For instance, you'll work with real Twitter data you capture from the net, implement MapReduce operations in Python and participate in a machine learning competition on Kaggle.com. Introduction to data science is likely to be frustrating to those expecting a general intro to data science. The course jumps around too much and uses too many different tools to be a good first course in data science, but the breadth of topics covered and programming assignments make this course worth a look if you already have some exposure to data science or the tools the course uses. If nothing else, you can skip through the lectures and watch sections that are of particular interest to you.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>98</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Data Science</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>44348</review_data_id><review_date>2014-08-08</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>Eclectic, fascinating, full of mistakes and mysteries. This course is not for the weak. First of all I would like to point out that you need to have experience in Python, SQL and programming in general otherwise this course will be just too difficult to complete. Each week there's a new topic and new assignments, totally different and all of them quite fun. Including sentiment analysis of twitter, matrix multiplication in SQL, Map-Reduce demonstration in Python, Writing and running Pig scripts in the Amazon AWS cluster, a Kaggle competition for machine learning and a visualization using Tableau. The assignments appear randomly, the instructors don't answer questions, the course is full of mistakes, glitches, missing links and many quirks that can be solved via some team work in the forums. It would be a mistake not to give five stars to this course because of those glitches and errors, they are just like life itself. The amount of things the course covers, the fun assignments and the very interesting topics makes this course really wonderful and that's why I'm giving it full marks, you will learn a lot, you will suffer some and you will have a lot of fun.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>98</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Data Science</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>42685</review_data_id><review_date>2014-07-24</review_date><review_value>1</review_value><review/></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>98</course_id><course_title>Introduction to Data Science</course_title><school>School:  University of Washington</school><review_data_id>29002</review_data_id><review_date>2014-04-14</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>It was a course with good syllabus but not well taught.

You get one attempt at each assignment and there are not really analogous worked examples in the lectures. You can't just look for a process - you have to understand the root of what the lectures mean. So: 1\. Watch the lectures. 2\. REALLY think about what the lectures mean. 3\. THEN Answer the questions. Step 1 takes about an hour, step 3 is 5 minutes. Step 2 is the fun part because game theory can be quite counter-intuitive and when it isn't counter-intuitive you assume you've made a mistake - when you haven't - like the game itself is playing a game and is bluffing you -WOOOAHHH DUDE! Yeah, game theory can be pretty trippy at first and the professors have no interest in making sure you feel safe answering the questions. Fantastic!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>24</course_id><course_title>Game Theory</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>865</review_data_id><review_date>2013-01-13</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>== Pros: == \- Lectures are very well done \- Community forum is active with good support from TA's == Cons: == \- The grading policy has changed and (in my opinion) ruins the an otherwise stellar course == More info on the grading policy: == Currently, you only get one chance to complete the test. This drastically increases the difficulty (which isn't a bad thing, but just something to note). HOWEVER, you get NO feedback whatsoever. You don't get to see what the correct answers are ... you don't even get to see which of the questions you got wrong. This made it really difficult for me to learn as this feedback was critical for me to understand how to correct my understanding.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>24</course_id><course_title>Game Theory</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>2252</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>I came into Game Theory with an BS in Engineering but no direct experience with the subject matter in a college setting. Compared to Ben Polak's Game Theory lectures via Yale (available on YouTube), this course has a lot of improving to do. The lecture videos and the accompanying "textbook" are poor vehicles for the—IMHO—very interesting subject matter. Toward the end of the class, I even skipped the material from this class in lieu of the Yale offerings on the week's subject matter—which actually made completing the week's homework assignments easier. The discussion fora for this course were great, and well-populated with useful information, insights, alternative learning materials, etc. It was probably the best part of this course. I can't be ungrateful for a free course, and the difficult homework kept me on my toes, but if you are really curious about this material, make sure to check out the Yale course videos. I think you'll agree that the instructor does a better job of conveying the ideas and keeping your attention. All in all, no regrets. Game Theory is profoundly interesting.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>24</course_id><course_title>Game Theory</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>3055</review_data_id><review_date>2013-08-26</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>I had no prior experience with this subject and I found it really challenging. It tested my maths but I did pass - just - which was a great relief. The course was well presented by likeable lecturers but because of the nature of the subject I think it would have benefited from more examples and earlier access to results and explanations for the exam questions. I bought the text book, but had to work really hard to understand the more complex areas. But it was very rewarding when I did finally work it all out!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>24</course_id><course_title>Game Theory</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>929</review_data_id><review_date>2013-02-09</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>ike: The assignments were fun to do. This is a math class (not a computer science or economics one.) I still wrote some groovy code in it though - I implemented the algorithms in code. I only took the first 3.5 weeks (of the 7 week class) though. I caught the flu during week 4 and know i have too much going on the rest of the course to even think about catching up. The lectures were clear with good inline exercises. The homeworks made you think and understand the material/apply it in new ways. There was also some links where you could play the games against other students and discuss strategies. The only thing I didn't like was the lack of feedback about homework. Once you get it wrong, knowing the right answer (and why) is important to learning.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>24</course_id><course_title>Game Theory</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>50</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-08</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I guess this course could greatly accompany the Model Thinking class. In the way that Game Theory takes some of those conceptions and gives you lots and lots of practice. Prerequisites: logical thinking, basic probability theory. Quizzes: most of them require careful thinking. Chances are on first try you'll get some of them wrong and then you'd be slapping your forehead when you see the correct answer :-). Note: in the new session (Jan 2013) you'll have ONLY ONE attempt per quiz. So it's much harder now. Video Lectures: quite good, very well explained and very engaging. Speed: 1.25 is probably the best. You'll learn about the "Tragedy of the Commons" and the "Prisoner's dilemma" and that may even help you in your everyday life. What I've learned from the course: \- Better understand motivations of the people. \- Better ways to negotiate and bargain (sort of microeconomics things) \- Now I know more types of auctions and the best ways to bid</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>24</course_id><course_title>Game Theory</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>4466</review_data_id><review_date>2013-12-11</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>Lectures doesn't enough to understand course.

It has been by far the most challenging. I have a BS/MS in computer science, but I had never studied game theory formally. The lectures are based upon abstract concepts: definitions, proofs, etc. There are a few concrete examples, but they are not the major focus. Unfortunately the quizzes and final are mostly concrete problems. It wasn't obvious how to apply the abstract concepts to the concrete cases. Thank God for the Discussion Forums. Student participation and assistance was fantastic. I passed with distinction, but I was only able to do so with the support of my fellow students. I will consider Game Theory II, but only when it is on Coursera.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>24</course_id><course_title>Game Theory</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>993</review_data_id><review_date>2013-02-28</review_date><review_value>4</review_value><review>i did not like this course at all. the only reason was that the lectures and notes never addressed the questions in the problem sets. every time i had to listen to the lectures atleast twice to understand what was taught. and at times even had to take help from various other external sources including some lectures on youtube (which i found to be more useful). every week seemed going more and more uphill.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>24</course_id><course_title>Game Theory</course_title><school>School:  Stanford University</school><review_data_id>515</review_data_id><review_date>2012-12-01</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>Prior experience in the course: Had heard of the Nash equilibrium ;) Like: The assignments were fun to do. The lectures were neat and engaging. Dislike: Sometimes the assignments borrowed directly from the lecture. Overall: A great course that explains the basics of game theory really well.

Putting logistical hiccups aside, the material is fairly applicable to real world situations. It will not teach you how to scrape, mine and transform network data. However, it will equip you with the academic nomenclature and enough theory so that you can develop the right intuition to analyze social networks. One neat thing about this class is that you really aren't confined to understanding just social networks. The professor grazes on a little bit of game theory, sociology, and even public policy. Feedback: One piece of feedback I left in my Coursera review for the class was that it would be nice to have some sort of lab, or reference supplement to teach you how to pull your own data (other than FB's). I also appreciated the emphasis on visual analysis since this is an introductory/general course. If you want to go above and beyond, there are readings/academic lit available on the website. Prerequisites: The beginning of the class introduced some math and statistics. The professor did not harp on memorizing equations, but understanding the formulas will definitely give you an edge in being able to intuit about particular situations.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>42</course_id><course_title>Social Network Analysis</course_title><school>School:  University of Michigan</school><review_data_id>899</review_data_id><review_date>2013-01-26</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>I dropped out the course around week 4. This is partially because I was taking too many other course and had to drop out some of them. However, I didn't feel that I was digesting the content even though I was able to complete assignments (I guess that was because programming assignments are optional and you tend to skip anything optional). There was also one assignment which let users compete how many followers you can get and discuss the tactic achieving it. It's interesting idea, but I didn't like the concept, so I did not participate.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>42</course_id><course_title>Social Network Analysis</course_title><school>School:  University of Michigan</school><review_data_id>4933</review_data_id><review_date>2014-01-31</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>A good introductory course. I quite enjoyed the videos: Lada has a casual style and is clearly passionate about the course content. Sometimes the quiz answers were unclear, but I think on the whole the test material was good (the quizzes could be repeated, so ambiguous questions would not impact the final grade). I didn't do the peer-reviewed assignments, as they looked far too difficult compared to the content of the lectures. In the end, I think the course was an enjoyable ride, but I feel like I'm missing very important pieces. I would like to know more about collecting data, for example. After the course I bought O'Reilly's excellent "Mining the Social Web", which explains quite a lot about getting data from social networks, blogs and other sites, and complemented well what I learned from this Coursera course. It would also be nice and interesting to have a more in-depths course (either as a separate course or as additional weeks), to continue learning about network analysis in all its forms.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>42</course_id><course_title>Social Network Analysis</course_title><school>School:  University of Michigan</school><review_data_id>4157</review_data_id><review_date>2013-12-08</review_date><review_value>8</review_value><review>On the positive side, the course had interesting content, the video lectures were good, the teacher was friendly, the course was flexible (programming exercises are optional, the material available long time in advance so you can follow the course at your own pace, etc.), responsive staff, interviews with people working at industry (facebook, linked in, etc.), there were many network simulations and interesting assignments in the course. On the negative side, the material could have been a bit more structured and there was a competition that was somehow spoiled by a bug in the system. All in all Im happy I have taken this course. I feel it was worth my time and Im thankful to the teacher for having made it available.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>42</course_id><course_title>Social Network Analysis</course_title><school>School:  University of Michigan</school><review_data_id>3793</review_data_id><review_date>2015-01-27</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>It is a so-so class. The best thing is it made it clear why further study and application of social network analysis can be very useful. On the down side, the professor seemed a bit too casual/loose/amateurish/unprepared. She was not one who exudes confidence and therefore makes the audience confident that they are learning the right things. After going through the entire course, I feel she is quite knowledgeable, but it isnt't something that comes off on a first impression. She also had some weird/wrong vocabulary or grammar that was not correct English, which made me wonder if English was her native language (which it is). As I was simultaneously taking the Excellent AI class from Berkeley and Excellent Intro to Programming class from MIT, her weaknesses were more apparent due to the contrast with these fine courses.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>42</course_id><course_title>Social Network Analysis</course_title><school>School:  University of Michigan</school><review_data_id>2254</review_data_id><review_date>2013-06-16</review_date><review_value>10</review_value><review>I came into this course with a BS in Engineering but no previous experience with this subject matter in a college setting. This was one of the best online courses I've taken. Lada's homework policies were flexible and thoughtful—and for this format, why shouldn't they be?—and her lectures were great launching points for further exploration. I say that because, if I had to find a fault with this class, it's that it is too short to properly cover the material. Lada's lectures inspired me to do lots of independent research on the topics, because her lectures left a lot to be explained and explored, which—don't get me wrong—is a great thing. She was a great instructor, though, and the material sells itself. What an interesting field! I wouldn't change a thing aside from making the course longer and more in-depth. I'm left wanting more—MISSION ACCOMPLISHED, LADA!</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>42</course_id><course_title>Social Network Analysis</course_title><school>School:  University of Michigan</school><review_data_id>110494</review_data_id><review_date>2015-07-14</review_date><review_value>6</review_value><review>The course was fascinating.

The topics are modern they are presented in a clear and interesting way along with many examples. Gephi and Netlogo are used to create simulations, models and analysis of social networks. Something to highlight about this course is that all of the examples, excercises and programming assignments really made sense, using interesting data for interesting and diverse problems. I loved the idea of a final peer-graded project with 3 different optional areas to cover and an open subject. It's fun and interesting to do and fun and interesting to grade and see what the other students did. This is a fun course with many interesting topics presented in an excellent way. Totally recommended.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>42</course_id><course_title>Social Network Analysis</course_title><school>School:  University of Michigan</school><review_data_id>4515</review_data_id><review_date>2013-12-12</review_date><review_value>5</review_value><review>I completed this class but did not get a Statement of Achievement because I didn't finish with a high enough %. However, this would be my review no matter what grade I got. I love this topic so I'm sad that I didn't pass. I can tell that Lada is very passionate about this subject. However, I felt the videos were a bit confusing. I'm pretty sure none of the questions I asked about the assignments in the discussion boards were answered by staff - which made them difficult. You were allowed to take the tests 100 times. Each time you retook it there were some questions that were replaced by new questions. Unfortunately, the tests never showed us which questions we got wrong - just that we had scored 6/10 or whatever. Without knowing which ones were wrong, along with a subject I'm trying to learn, and a rotating set of questions, I really never found out what I truly knew. Questions about this went unanswered but finally in the last week of tests, the tests starting showing which questions were wrong. A little too late. Additionally, some of us were having problems getting Gephi to work on any computer for various reasons, and could not complete that portion of the tests (I just guessed). The questions about how to work around this also went unanswered. At the same time I was taking this class, I also took a class about Epidemics from Pennsylvania State U. It was nice because the class content complemented each other very well. The Epidemics class was far easier to understand and follow, and had a more professional presentation.</review></Course-Reivew><Course-Reivew><course_id>42</course_id><course_title>Social Network Analysis</course_title><school>School:  University of Michigan</school><review_data_id>994</review_data_id><review_date>2013-02-28</review_date><review_value>7</review_value><review>though i had taken an amazing course 'networked life' from university of Pennsylvania before starting this course, i.e. i had some knowledge of the topics to be covered in the course, yet i found this course tough. its main drawback was that it's lectures were not structured properly. yet the involvement form the lecturer via google hangouts, programming assignments and projects(optional) were tremendous. i found the lecturer to be very involving and creative outside the lectures. so overall review : fine.</review></Course-Reivew></ROOT>
