Together, they are designed to help people with no prior exposure to computer science or programming learn to think computationally and write programs to tackle useful problems. Some of the people taking the two courses will use them as a stepping stone to more advanced computer science courses, but for many it will be their first and last computer science courses. This run features updated lecture videos, lecture exercises, and problem sets to use the new version of Python 3.5. Even if you took the course with Python 2.7, you will be able to easily transition to Python 3.5 in future courses, or enroll now to refresh your learning. 
Since these courses may be the only formal computer science courses many of the students take, we have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics so they will have an idea of what is possible when they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. That said, they are not "computation appreciation" courses. They are challenging and rigorous courses in which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend the computer to their will.

That crazy data collection from your boss? Megabytes of sensor data to analyze? Looking for a smart way visualize your data in order to make sense out of it? We’ve got you covered!
Using video lectures and hands-on exercises, we will teach you cutting-edge techniques and best practices that will boost your data analysis and visualization skills.
We will take a deep dive into data analysis with spreadsheets: PivotTables, VLOOKUPS, Named ranges, what-if analyses, making great graphs - all those will be covered in the first weeks of the course. After that, we will investigate the quality of the spreadsheet model, and especially how to make sure your spreadsheet remains error-free and robust.
Finally, once we have mastered spreadsheets, we will demonstrate other ways to store and analyze data. We will also look into how Python, a programming language, can help us with analyzing and manipulating data in spreadsheets.
EX101x is created using Excel 2013 and Windows. Most assignments can be made using another spreadsheet program and operating system as well, but we cannot offer full support for all configurations.
The goal of this course is to help you to overcome data analysis challenges in your work, research or studies. Therefore we encourage you to participate actively and to raise real data analysis problems that you face in our discussion forums.

As need for humanitarian aid grows, how can efforts to alleviate human suffering evolve with it?
This course from the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative and HarvardX seeks to prepare learners to recognize and analyze emerging challenges in the humanitarian field. The course explores the ethical and professional principles that guide humanitarian response to conflict and disaster. Participants will learn the legal and historical frameworks that shaped these principles, test their applicability to the challenges faced by humanitarian actors today.
Through four case studies covering the responses to crises in Goma (Zaire), Somalia, the Balkans, Afghanistan and Pakistan, participants will engage with Harvard faculty, current practitioners, and one another. These cases introduce major trends affecting the current landscape of humanitarian response – including rapid population displacement, violence against aid workers, and civil-military engagement. Thoughtfully engaging with this course will prepare participants to be informed and aware humanitarian practitioners, scholars, policy-makers, and global citizens.

Together, they are designed to help people with no prior exposure to computer science or programming learn to think computationally and write programs to tackle useful problems. Some of the people taking the two courses will use them as a stepping stone to more advanced computer science courses, but for many it will be their first and last computer science courses. This run features updated lecture videos, lecture exercises, and problem sets to use the new version of Python 3.5. Even if you took the course with Python 2.7, you will be able to easily transition to Python 3.5 in future courses, or enroll now to refresh your learning. 
Since these courses may be the only formal computer science courses many of the students take, we have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics so they will have an idea of what is possible when they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. That said, they are not "computation appreciation" courses. They are challenging and rigorous courses in which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend the computer to their will.

The financial programming exercise simulates what IMF (International Monetary Fund) desk economists routinely do in their country surveillance and program work.
In the first part of the course (modules 1–7), you will analyze the economic outlook of a country case and then help to build a baseline scenario — namely, a set of projections for the main macroeconomic sectors (real, external, government and monetary) that reflects the analyst’s best guess of what will happen to the economy in the coming year, assuming no policy change.
In the second part (modules 8–10), you will learn and discuss how macroeconomic policies can be used to address poor performance and reduce macroeconomic imbalances. We will illustrate the workings of monetary, fiscal and exchange rate policies by using a simple Keynesian model of an open economy. In the final module you will design an IMF–supported lending program scenario for our country case.

With this in mind, it is no surprise that one fourth of the CEOs of the world’s 100 largest corporations have an engineering degree.
Solving these global problems requires leaders who, in the first place, are comfortable with technology, models and quantitative analyses -- Leaders who see systems instead of isolated problems. However, simply understanding technology is not enough. Successful leaders today must have both the ideas and the know-how to put these ideas into action by working collaboratively with others, winning their hearts and minds.
We need leaders who know how to seize opportunities in a networked world, and can mobilize people and other stakeholders for large-scale change. Leaders who lead fulfilling lives and who are able to move themselves and others from the ‘me’ to the ‘we’. Leaders who are long-term oriented and who deliver economic profit, while also making positive contributions to society and the environment. We call these leaders ‘sustainable leaders’.
This course has three parts:
 In the first part, you will explore the context that leaders are facing, building an understanding of the complexities of global and business challenges. You will discover the ambiguities and the many stakeholders that leaders must consider when making their choices. You will get a sense of effective leadership practices.
In the second part, you will discover your “who am I” through personal and group exercises. You will create a “Personal Charter” that can serve as a life-long guide, helping you, as a leader, to make important choices in your personal and professional life.
In the third part, we will bring the knowledge of the context and yourself together. We will translate the insights of this course into a leadership model and you will discover what sustainable leaders do. We will offer you frameworks to help you make your own career choices. We will finally help you to ‘sell’ yourself as a leader.

Everyone wants to be agile, but what does it really mean and how do you achieve agile development?
This computer science course cuts beyond the agile methodology hype and teaches you the fundamental agile concepts that span a wide range of methodologies. It analyzes the key agile ideas, their benefits, their limitations, and how best to take advantage of them to enhance your software skills and show employers that you have mastered an essential component of today's IT industry.
The course is divided into six parts:
The Agile manifesto and the context of agile methods
Agile principles: what key methodological ideas underlie the agile movement?
Agile roles: how does agile redefine traditional software jobs and tasks, in particular the manager's role?
Agile practices: what are the concrete techniques that agile teams use to apply these methods?
Agile artifacts: what practical tools are essential to the work of agile developers?
Agile assessment: among agile ideas, which ones are essentially hyped and useless, which ones are actually harmful, and which ones will truly help you effectively produce high-quality software?
Unlike many presentations of agile methods, this course takes a strictly objective view of agile methods, enabling you to retain the best agile principles and practices. By analyzing agile methods in depth and showing you how to benefit from them, it will make you a better developer, equipped to deal with the challenges of ambitious software projects.The Agile manifesto and the context of agile methods

The introductory module considers methodologies historians use to “visualize” the past, followed by three modules that explore the themes of Westernization, in Commodore Perry’s 1853-54 expedition to Japan; social protest, in Tokyo’s 1905 Hibiya Riot; and modernity, as seen in the archives of the major Japanese cosmetics company, Shiseido.
The course will cover the following topics in four modules:
Module 0: Introduction: New Historical Sources for a Digital Age (Professors Dower, Gordon, Miyagawa). Digitization has dramatically altered historians' access to primary sources, making large databases of the visual record readily accessible. How is historical methodology changing in response to this seismic shift? How can scholars, students, and the general public make optimal use of these new digital resources?
Module 1: Black Ships &amp; Samurai (Professor Dower). Commodore Matthew Perry's 1853-54 expedition to force Japan to open its doors to the outside world is an extraordinary moment to look at by examining and comparing the visual representations left to us by both the American and Japanese sides of this encounter. This module also addresses the rapid Westernization undertaken by Japan in the half century following the Perry mission.
Module 2: Social Protest in Imperial Japan: The Hibiya Riot of 1905 (Professor Gordon). The dramatic daily reports from participants in the massive "Hibiya Riot" in 1905, the first major social protest in the age of "imperial democracy" in Japan, offer a vivid and fresh perspective on the contentious domestic politics of an emerging imperial power.
Module 3: Modernity in Interwar Japan: Shiseido &amp; Consumer Culture (Professors Dower, Gordon, Weisenfeld). Exploring the vast archives of the Shiseido cosmetics company opens a fascinating window on the emergence of consumer culture, modern roles for women, and global cosmopolitanism from the 'teens through the 1920s and even into the era of Japanese militarism and aggression in the 1930s. This module will also tap other Visualizing Cultures units on modernization and modernity.
The course is based on the MIT "Visualizing Cultures" website devoted to image-driven research on Japan and China since the 19th century (visualizingcultures.mit.edu).

Both courses provide a solid foundation in the area of reliable distributed computing, including the main concepts, results, models and algorithms in the field.
Today's global IT infrastructures are distributed systems; from the Internet to the data-centers of cloud computing that fuel the current revolution of global IT services. At the core of these services you find distributed algorithms.
These algorithms run on multiple computers and communicate only by sending and receiving messages. It is crucial for the implemented services to continue to work 24/7 even if some of the computers fail or some of the messages are lost in transit. This is the subject of reliable distributed algorithms in computer science.
ID2203.1x covers models of distributed algorithms based on input/output automata; specifications of fault tolerant abstractions and failure detectors; specific distributed abstractions and fault-tolerant algorithms, including reliable broadcast and causal broadcast; key-value stores and consistency models; single-value consensus and the Paxos algorithm.
To complete the course with a full grade (100%) students are required to answer the graded quizzes provided every week, as well as the programming assignments.Event-driven concurrent programming of distributed algorithms
Formal models of asynchronous systems using input/output automata
Failure detectors and equivalence between various distributed abstractions
Specifications and algorithms for reliable and causal-order broadcast

This law course includes interviews with individuals who have used surrogacy and sperm donation, with medical professionals who are experts in current reproductive technologies like In Vitro Fertilization and Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis, and bioethicists and journalists who study the ownership and use of genetic information within human tissue. Additional Harvard colleagues will also share with you their thoughts on topics such as disability law as it relates to reproductive technology.
While the law and ethics surrounding these technologies are a central component to this course, we also show you examples of the deeply personal and human side of these issues. Throughout the course, and with the help of law students, we will discuss leading legal cases in this field, which will illuminate the types of questions the law has struggled with – stretching and evolving over time. From the famous Baby M surrogacy case, to cases on the paternity of sperm donors, to a case related to the ownership of human tissue turned into a commercial product, and others. We will show you the ethical, legal, and rhetorical underpinnings, which have served as the basis for various court decisions over the past 20 or 30 years. We will also explore potential future technologies and their implications for society: genetic enhancements to increase our intelligence, let us live a hundred years longer, or make us immune to diseases – and the possibility of creating animal-human hybrids, for example a mouse with a humanized brain.
The content within this course is intended to be instructive, and show how legal reasoning has been applied, or could be applied, to questions related to parenthood, reproduction, and other issues surrounding human genetic material. The material organized within this course should be considered an authoritative overview, but is not intended to serve as medical or legal advice.
This course is designed for a diverse audience including, but not limited to, law students, prospective law students, medical professionals, as well as members of the general public interested in questions and topics related to surrogacy, parenthood, genetic and reproductive technology, ownership of genetic material, and more. You do not need any background in law, medicine, philosophy, or really any subject to enjoy this course. This course is meant to be an introduction for anyone interested in these topics.

Important themes to be discussed include the ideal of wu-wei or “effortless action,” the paradox of how one can consciously try not to try, mindfulness techniques and self-cultivation, models of the self and society, rationality versus emotions, trust and human cooperation, and the structure and impact of different spiritual and political ideals.
This period of Chinese history witnessed the formation of all of the major indigenous schools of Chinese thought (Confucianism, Daoism, Mohism and Legalism), which in turn had an impact on the development of East Asian cultural history that is still felt today. We will also explore parallels with Western philosophical and religious traditions, the relevance of early Chinese thought for contemporary debates in ethics, moral education, and political philosophy, and the manner in which early Chinese models of the self anticipate recent developments in the evolutionary and cognitive sciences.
This course provides a full university semester’s worth of material broken into two parts. Each part of the course will last 5 weeks, with a week-long break in between. For each part, there will be four weeks worth of new material. The fifth week will be reserved for review and completion of the final exam.
Part 1 introduces the basic philosophical, religious and scientific concepts that will be drawn upon throughout the course, and then goes on to cover early Shang and Zhou religious thought, the Analects of Confucius, the Daodejing (a Daoist text attributed to Laozi), the utilitarian thinker Mozi, the newly discovered and very exciting Guodian texts, and the momentous philosophical changes that occurred in the mid Warring States period.

This computer science course is a bottom-up exploration of the abstractions, principles, and techniques used in the design of digital and computer systems. If you have a rudimentary knowledge of electricity and some exposure to programming, roll up your sleeves, join in and design a computer system!
This is Part 1 of a 3-part series on digital systems, teaching the fundamentals of digital circuit design and is based on a course offered by the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Topics include digital encoding of information, principles of digital signaling; combinational and sequential logic, implementation in CMOS, useful canonical forms, synthesis; latency, throughput and pipelining.
Using your browser for design entry and simulation, you’ll get to design and debug circuits at both the transistor- and gate-level, culminating in the creation of a 32-bit arithmetic and logic unit.
  Learner Testimonial
“This course is like a dream coming true...as kid (10 - 12 years) I was already building circuits and reading books about Digital Circuits. Due to all kind of circumstances I never got to pursue a study and career in electronics ...now I am almost 50... I see this as a second chance. Thank you very very much for this awesome course. One of the best, (if not the best) MOOCs I've ever taken.” -- Previous StudentHow to efficiently and reliably encode information using bits

Then, we’ll learn the correct statistical tool to help answer our question of interest – using R and hands-on Labs. Finally, we’ll learn how to interpret our findings and develop a meaningful conclusion.
This course will consist of:
Instructional videos for statistical concepts broken down into manageable topics
Guided questions to help your understanding of the topic
Weekly tutorial videos for using R Scaffolded learning with Pre-Labs (using R), followed by Labs where we will answer specific questions using real-world datasets
Weekly wrap-up questions challenging both topic and application knowledge
We will cover basic Descriptive Statistics – learning about visualizing and summarizing data, followed by a “Modeling” investigation where we’ll learn about linear, exponential, and logistic functions. We will learn how to interpret and use those functions with basic Pre-Calculus. These two “units” will set the learner up nicely for the second part of the course: Inferential Statistics with a multiple regression cap.
Both parts of the course are intended to cover the same material as a typical introductory undergraduate statistics course, with an added twist of modeling. This course is also intentionally devised to be sequential, with each new piece building on the previous topics. Once completed, students should feel comfortable using basic statistical techniques to answer their own questions about their own data, using a widely available statistical software package (R).
With these new skills, learners will leave the course with the ability to use basic statistical techniques to answer their own questions about their own data, using a widely available statistical software package (R). Learners from all walks of life can use this course to better understand their data, to make valuable informed decisions.
Join us in learning how to look at the world around us. What are the questions? How can we answer them? And what do those answers tell us about the world we live in?Descriptive Statistics

From its humble beginnings as dance hall entertainment, jazz is now embraced as an art form, respected and imitated the world over.
This music course addresses jazz from a listener’s perspective, but calls on professional jazz musicians to help us engage with this often mysterious aural experience. This six-week course will enable interaction with the basic components of jazz (swing, improvisation, structure and personal expression) while providing an inside connection to the artists who perform it.
Content includes excerpts from the 300+ video interviews gathered with jazz personalities for the Fillius Jazz Archive, select scholarly readings and demonstrations offered by the instructor, a working musician. Students will engage in user-friendly activities that include listening, responding, counting, and internalizing the concepts that make jazz work. Rarely heard stories and anecdotes offered by our interviewees will stimulate the imagination and provide rich content for open discussion.
We will celebrate the completion of the course with a live concert, streamed to participants of the course, who will also have an opportunity to interact with Monk. 
Jazz: The Music, The Stories, The Players will appeal equally to the casual listener, the avid fan and the proficient jazz player.What makes jazz “swing”

Most traditional methods are of a repetitive, rule-based nature and will be gradually replaced by Artificial Intelligence. In the knowledge era, the most value added job will be to manage knowledge, which includes how knowledge is created, mined, processed, shared and reused in different trades and industry. At the same time, the amount of data and information (prerequisites of knowledge) is exploding exponentially. By 2020, IDC projects that the size of the digital universe will reach 40 zetabytes from all sources including, websites, weblog, sensors, and social media. Big data will transform how we live, work and even think. These trends and more will have a profound effect on how we see the world and create policies. In this course, the following topics are covered:
What is knowledge management?
How is knowledge captured, elicited, organized and created in business?
What is big data and how can we use data analytics from a laymen perspective?
What is Open Linked Data and how can it support machine reasoning?
What defines the era of Science 2.0?
How can new knowledge be mined from big data?
What are the technical and social problems with big data?
What is cloud computing and cloud services?
What are examples of applications and case studies?
The course is offered by the Knowledge Management and Innovation Research Center (KMIRC) of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Most of our research is company and industry based. Capabilities and competencies of the KMIRC are further strengthened by the international alliances it has formed with leading practitioners, many of which are regarded as members of the "Hall of Fame" in knowledge management, and renowned worldwide.

In this mathematics course, we will examine optimization through a Business Analytics lens. You will be introduced to the to the theory, algorithms, and applications of optimization. Linear and integer programming will be taught both algebraically and geometrically, and then applied to problems involving data. Students will develop an understanding of algebraic formulations, and use Julia/JuMP for computation. Theoretical components of the course are made approachable, and require no formal background in linear algebra or calculus.
The recommended audience for this course is undergraduates, as well as professionals interested in using optimization software. The content in this course has applications in logistics, marketing, project management, finance, statistics and machine learning.
Most of the course material will be covered in lecture and recitation videos, and only an optional textbook, available at no cost, will be used.
Students interested in the material prior to deciding on course enrollment can visit the MIT Open Courseware version of 15.053 Spring 2013. The topics of the 2013 subject were optimization modeling, algorithms, and theory. As a six week subject, 15.053x covers about half of the material of the 2013 subject.

ITSx comprehensively introduces analysts to interrupted time series analysis (ITS) and regression discontinuity designs (RD) from start to finish, including definition of an appropriate research question, selection and setup of data sources, statistical analysis, interpretation and presentation, and identification of potential pitfalls.
 
At the conclusion of the course, students will have all the tools necessary to propose, conduct and correctly interpret an analysis using ITS and RD approaches. They will also develop a real-life research proposal that could form the basis of future research. This will help them position themselves as a go-to person within their company, government department, or academic department as the technical expert on this topic.
 
ITS and RD designs avoid many of the pitfalls associated with other techniques. As a result of their analytic strength, the use of ITS and RD approaches has been rapidly increasing over the past decade. These studies have cut across the social sciences, including:
Studying the effect of traffic speed zones on mortality
Quantifying the impact of incentive payments to workers on productivity
Assessing whether alcohol policies reduce suicide
Measuring the impact of incentive payments to physicians on quality of care
Determining whether the use of HPV vaccination influences adolescent sexual behavior
 The strengths and drawbacks of ITS and RD studies
Data requirements, setup, and statistical modelling
Interpretation of results for non-technical audiences

Around the world, people who are fed up with environmental degradation and the breakdown of their communities come together to transform blighted vacant lots, trashed-out stream corridors, polluted estuaries, and other “broken places.” Civic ecology practices—such as community gardening, wetlands restoration, river cleanups, and tree planting—are a means for people to express resilience and rebuild communities marked by disaster and disinvestment.
Civic ecology draws on psychology, sociology, political science, education, ecology, and social-ecological systems resilience to understand how and why people care for nature and their communities.
Throughout this course, you will:
Explore the people, places, and practices that restore nature and revitalize neighborhoods, making a difference in ways big and small.
Discuss and evaluate contemporary thinking in resilience, social-ecological systems, and the relationship between nature and human/community wellbeing.
Grasp an understanding of how civic ecology enables those with limited resources to defy and cope with daily struggles, including after disaster and war.
Acquire the knowledge and skill set to enact change in your own community.
Participate in a civic ecology service learning project to turn classroom learning into real-life application.
This course is ideal for a learner who is intrigued by both social and environmental concerns, or simply has a desire to dive into an emerging 21st century, cross-disciplinary subject area. You will complete this course with a keener awareness of social-ecological issues and concerns, as well as a greater knowledge of the practical steps required to rebuild and maintain community and nature in a world marked by inequality, conflict, and climate change.Define civic ecology and its practices
Describe a diverse range of civic ecology practices, stewards, and places

(based on Scratch).
Computing has profoundly changed the world, opening up wonderful new ways for people to connect, design, research, play, create, and express themselves. However, just using a computer is only a small part of the picture. The real transformative and empowering experience comes when one learns how to program the computer, to translate ideas into code.
This course teaches students how to do exactly that, using Snap! (based on Scratch), one of the friendliest programming languages ever invented. It's purely graphical, which means programming involves simply dragging blocks around, and building bigger blocks out of smaller blocks. But this course is far more than just learning to program. We focus on seven big ideas (creativity, abstraction, data and information, algorithms, programming, the Internet, and global impact), and six computational thinking practices (connecting computing, creating computational artifacts, abstracting, analyzing problems and artifacts, communicating, and collaborating). Throughout the course, relevance is emphasized: relevance to the student and to society.
Topics include:
Abstraction
Programming Paradigms Algorithms
Global Implications of Computing
Lab-Based Topics: Snap! Programming, Conditionals and Abstraction, Lists and the Internet

We all want to be happy, and there are countless ideas about what happiness is and how we can get some. But not many of those ideas are based on science. That’s where this course comes in.
“The Science of Happiness” is the first MOOC to teach the ground-breaking science of positive psychology, which explores the roots of a happy and meaningful life. Students will engage with some of the most provocative and practical lessons from this science, discovering how cutting-edge research can be applied to their own lives. Created by UC Berkeley’s Greater Good Science Center, the course will zero in on a fundamental finding from positive psychology: that happiness is inextricably linked to having strong social connections and contributing to something bigger than yourself—the greater good. Students will learn about the cross-disciplinary research supporting this view, spanning the fields of psychology, neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and beyond.
What’s more, “The Science of Happiness” offers students practical strategies for tapping into and nurturing their own happiness, including trying several research-backed activities that foster social and emotional well-being, and exploring how their own happiness changes along the way.
The course’s co-instructors, Dacher Keltner and Emiliana Simon-Thomas, are not only leading authorities on positive psychology but also gifted teachers skilled at making science fun and personal. They’ll be joined by world-renowned experts discussing themes like empathy, mindfulness, and gratitude—experts including Barbara Fredrickson, Paul Ekman, Sonja Lyubomirsky, and Jon Kabat-Zinn. Health professionals who register can earn continuing education units for their participation.

Properties such as stiffness, electrical conductivity, thermal expansion, strength, and optical properties are the vehicle by which you can learn a great deal of practical chemistry. 
You will see how experts use their knowledge of trends in the periodic table to predict the properties of materials. 3.091x is an engineering course so there is an emphasis on applications and how materials are used. The on-campus version of the course has been taught for over forty years and is one of the largest classes at MIT.
This course will cover the relationship between electronic structure, chemical bonding, and atomic order, and characterization of atomic arrangements in crystalline and amorphous solids: metals, ceramics, semiconductors, and polymers (including proteins). There will be topical coverage of organic chemistry, solution chemistry, acid-base equilibria, electrochemistry, biochemistry, chemical kinetics, diffusion, and phase diagrams. Examples will be drawn from industrial practice (including the environmental impact of chemical processes), from energy generation and storage (e.g., batteries and fuel cells), and from emerging technologies (e.g., photonic and biomedical devices). You will develop your “chemical intuition”

This course is the first of three in a series of mechanics courses from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at MIT. Taken together, these courses provide similar content to the MIT subject 3.032: Mechanical Behavior of Materials.
The 3.032x series provides an introduction to the mechanical behavior of materials, from both the continuum and atomistic points of view. At the continuum level, we learn how forces and displacements translate into stress and strain distributions within the material. At the atomistic level, we learn the mechanisms that control the mechanical properties of materials.  Examples are drawn from metals, ceramics, glasses, polymers, biomaterials, composites and cellular materials.
Part 1 covers stress-strain behavior, topics in linear elasticity and the atomic basis for linear elasticity, and composite materials.
Part 2 covers stress transformations, beam bending, column buckling, and cellular materials.
Part 3 covers viscoelasticity (behavior intermediate to that of an elastic solid and that of a viscous fluid), plasticity (permanent deformation), creep in crystalline materials (time dependent behavior), brittle fracture (rapid crack propagation) and fatigue (failure due to repeated loading of a material).

In this research course, you will learn the underlying principles that are needed to conduct research from an engineering perspective.
This course is designed for engineering students conducting postgraduate research work on engineering projects. The objective of the course is to translate current research methods, which are mostly from a social science perspective, into something more relatable and understandable to engineers. Our hope for this course is to go beyond the concepts to understand the actual reasons for doing research in a certain way. While engineers are the main target audience, non-engineers will find this information useful as well.
The methods taught in this course will equip you with the knowledge needed to design, plan and construct your own research process.An understanding of when research is contributing to shared knowledge

This course is Part 1 of a 4-part series on Business Statistics, and is ideal for learners who wish to enroll in business programs. The first two courses cover topics in Descriptive Statistics, whereas the next two courses focus on Inferential Statistics.
Spreadsheets containing real data from diverse areas such as economics, finance and HR drive much of our discussions.  
In Part 1, we shall be exploring multiple ways to describe these datasets, numerically as well as visually. Throughout, we shall embrace a problem-based approach to understanding the material: the primary reason to pick up a tool or a technique will be to solve a problem. Our course makes judicious use of tools.
In Part 2, we shall take up a few datasets that have over a million rows, which makes it impossible to analyze using a spreadsheet. This is a natural setting for R, an advanced statistical programming platform. The courses incorporate helpful tutorials to get learners acquainted with both the mechanisms. Parts 3 and 4 are dedicated to Inferential Statistics. In Part 3, we begin by exploring the benefits of random sampling, and apply the Central Limit Theorem to arrive at confidence intervals for important population parameters. We also learn how to formulate hypotheses for business data, and resolve them with the testing framework that we establish. Along the way, we shall compare two or more populations and draw inferences with a set of statistical tests.
You will learn all these concepts with the help of various demonstrations, which show real-life application of the concepts related to business situations.To download data from prominent Internet sources
To analyse a dataset using spreadsheet software
To pose pertinent business questions of datasets and to answer them
To clean up a dataset and summarize the data using single point measures of centrality and dispersion

The core of this course is a series of weekly lab assignments in which you and your fellow students will work in teams to use historical knowledge from the course to solve problems and develop new connections and interpretations of primary historical materials.
The course begins in 1300 AD at the height of the Silk Road, the triumphs of the Mongol Empire, and the spread of one of the most devastating contagions of all time, the Black Death. It examines the emergence of an international system of competitive empires and its effect on trade and exchange. We look at the Age of Revolution, and discuss industrialization during the 1800s. The course concludes with a close look at the 20th century and current-day globalization.
Course themes include migration and statelessness, economic integration, warfare and conflict, the transformation of the ecological balance, and cultural responses and innovations. To grapple with these themes, we explore first-hand perspectives of historical actors through a collection of texts and images.

For example, they help us figure out which of your emails are spam, what results to show you when you search on Google, how a self-driving car should navigate its environment, or even how a computer can beat the best Jeopardy and Go players! What do all of these examples have in common? They are all situations in which a computer program can carry out inferences in the face of uncertainty at a speed and accuracy that far exceed what we could do in our heads or on a piece of paper.
In this data analysis and computer programming course, you will learn the principles of probability and inference. We will put these mathematical concepts to work in code that solves problems people care about. You will learn about different data structures for storing probability distributions, such as probabilistic graphical models, and build efficient algorithms for reasoning with these data structures.
By the end of this course, you will know how to model real-world problems with probability, and how to use the resulting models for inference.
You don’t need to have prior experience in either probability or inference, but you should be comfortable with basic Python programming and calculus.

Arm yourself with the essential principles and practices of marketing in the digital economy by making this course, taught by Internet consumer shopping expert and Wharton professor David Bell, an indispensable part of your knowledge base.
In this business and management course, you will gain an understanding of how the digital economy works and develop the critical insights necessary to succeed in e-commerce and digital and social media marketing.
The fixed and mobile Internet and related technologies exert a profound influence on how business and social institutions evolve, how they are challenged—and sometimes, even displaced. Companies that were non-existent a few short years ago, including Facebook, LinkedIn, and Uber, have dramatically changed how we interact, communicate and get from point A to B. Even Amazon and Google are relatively “young” by any measure. If you’re an entrepreneur, investor, manager, or student, you need thoughtful approaches to navigate and win in this new environment.
This course is organized around four broad themes and we will use relevant theory and analysis, as well as numerous practical examples to develop our key learning points.
The themes are:
Behavioral foundations for understanding and navigating the new online-offline landscape
New forms of interaction, including formation of networks and reputation building
Tools and principles of digital marketing action including online advertising on fixed and mobile devices
New media platforms and emergence of “organic” celebrities and communities
This course is beneficial to marketing professionals, analysts, entrepreneurs, small business owners, investors, and consumers This course evolved from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School’s very first course on digital marketing and e-commerce.How to leverage new models in business and e-commerce to increase profitability

Finite Element Method (FEM) is a powerful tool. FEM is an effective numerical technique for partial differential equations (PDEs) in engineering. The fact that modern engineers can obtain detailed information for structural, thermal, electromagnetic problems with virtual experiments largely gives credit to FEM. The finite element method provides infinite possibilities for engineering, and this course provides a detailed introduction of FEM and its applications in engineering and beyond.
This course is divided into 15 lessons, which introduce basic equations of mechanics, mathematical principles of FEM, realizations in both discrete and continuum structures, various applications in engineering and skills at modeling with FEM software. Examples are demonstrated with MATLAB and ANSYS.Basic equations of mechanics

Have you ever wondered what motivates some people to become activists? What experiences in your childhood or when you were a teenager may have shaped your political identity? Join us, along with Gloria Steinem, Loretta Ross, and others, in a seven-week exploration of these questions and more. In this course, you will analyze some of the psychological theories that help explain what leads people to want to change society.
Through rich, interactive case studies you will meet nine prominent women activists who were engaged in efforts and movements in the U.S. from the 1960s through the 1990s including the Civil Rights Movement, the LGBTQ Movement, and the Reproductive Justice Movement. Within our online community you will discuss and debate how psychological theories can explain these activists’ motivations, discover where the theories are and are not applicable, and collaboratively create new understandings and analyses.
Each week, Gloria Steinem (SC ‘56) will provide her thoughts and insight into how these theories might apply to contemporary issues.

As almost every building and every city is a prototype, these communities are in the early stage of development and require specific attention and expertise as we advance.
Smart cities, such as Zurich and Boston, consist of human-made structures or environments that are, in some capacity, monitored, metered, networked and controlled. With this functionality, combined with stationary sensors and mobile devices, data and information have become the new building materials of future cities. Using this data, citizens are now beginning to influence the design of future cities and the re-design of existing ones.
In this architecture course, you will learn the basics of information cities and urban science research, as well as how dynamic behavior and citizen-driven learning differentiate the responsive city from the smart city. The cities we present and develop in this course use the stocks and flows of information as the main drivers of change.
To deepen your knowledge of smart cities and give a perspective on the future of these cities, we also introduce the concept of citizen design science, a combination of citizen science, urban design, and cognitive design computing. Participants will furthermore have unique access to a design research platform for citizen design science. The intelligent use of data and information is at the core of this course, and these concepts will be the next generation of participatory design and design computing environments.
This course is part of the “Future Cities” XSeries, and builds on the experiences from our first two urban MOOCs: Future Cities and Livability in Future Cities.Understand the concept of smart cities, why these are still prototypes and what the challenges are.
Identify the principle of stocks and flows of information in cities at different scales.
Understand the concept of citizen design science and its importance for responsive cities.
Understand the concept of complexity science in the context of architecture and city planning.
Learn through citizen design science how you can interact and get involved in the planning of your own cities.
Articulate what a responsive city is, and identify the criteria for a city to be responsive.</description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>84</course_id><title>AP® Psychology - Course 1: What is Psychology?</title><published_date>2016-01-28T08:55:07-05:00</published_date><course_length>3 weeks</course_length><effort>8-12 hours per week</effort><subject>Science</subject><price>FREE

The Computational Geometry taught in this course is derived from classical discrete/combinatorial geometry and modern computer science.
Computational Geometry first appeared on the horizon when M. I. Shamos presented his Ph.D. dissertation in 1978. Since then, this phrase has been used to refer to algorithmic study on discrete and combinatorial geometric structures and can also be regarded as the geometric version of Algorithm Design and Analysis. Computational Geometry is now considered the basis of robotics, computer aided design and manufacturing (CAM and CID), and geographic information systems (GIS).Awareness of Computational Geometry theory that will help students incorporate Computational Geometry into their future research.

As Asian economies expand and become more involved in the global economy, a lingua franca – a language used to communicate among groups of people who do not share a mother tongue – is needed to exchange information. This course has two goals. The first is to introduce non-native speakers of English to methods for developing spoken English language and communication skills for doing business in Asia. The second is to examine the impact of interculturality and globalization on English communications. By exploring and participating in a business simulation set in Asia, you will develop the principal skills for effective communication in English when conducting business in China and other Asian countries.Pronounce sounds clearly and use rhythm appropriately and persuasively

Have you started a novel only to run out of steam halfway through? Led by international best-selling authors and professors from The University of British Columbia’s world-renowned Creative Writing MFA program, this is part of a series of courses designed to take your novel from concept to completion.
Outlining is a crucial step in the novel writing process, one that fuels creativity and prepares the writer to stay on track and avoid common pitfalls. Through hands-on weekly exercises with a focus on craft and process, as well as insights from the real-world practices of accomplished authors, this course explores the core elements of fiction writing necessary to build an outline. You will learn the fundamentals of character development, world-building and the basics of storytelling architecture. You'll work intensively on your own creative project and hone your outline through feedback and discussion with fellow writers.
In the tradition of the UBC MFA program, this course draws on the work habits of established authors to help writers move quickly toward creating a blueprint for a successful draft. Whether you’re seeking literary fame or working on a project to share with family and friends, this course offers the tools and skills necessary to plan a novel others will be excited to read.
The course is recommended for professional and aspiring writers, writing groups, participants in NaNoWriMo, teachers and anyone who has ever dreamed of writing a novel.
FAQ
Do I need to have started a novel to take this course?
No. However, you should have one or more novel ideas that you wish to work on during this course. We will ask you to start developing your idea right away.
What if I’m in the middle of a novel?
If you have already started a novel, or are having issues with a partially finished manuscript without an outline, this course can help you clarify your intentions and work out structural issues. We believe the process of outlining helps writers understand a work in progress in a way that simply ‘writing through’ cannot.
Is this course related to an existing UBC writing class?
This is an entirely new course, created by instructors with years of experience teaching the art of fiction writing to undergraduate and graduate university students as well as members of the community.
What are the other courses in the series?
How to Write a Novel: Writing the Draft provides an essential fiction craft toolbox for writers struggling with the common hurdles of first drafts. How to Write a Novel: Edit and Revise, is in the early stages of development. When it is launched, it will be suitable for students who have completed a full draft of their novel.

Studying the science of GMOs helps us understand biotechnology’s potential role in addressing challenges in agriculture.
In this introductory Food and Nutrition course, you will learn the basics of genetic engineering, explore the political debate around the GMO and review the arguments for and against their use.
We will study the politics surrounding the GMO and its impact at both an individual level and to society as a whole; including the problems, perceptions, benefits, and risks associated with GMOs. Important to understanding the complexities around this topic we will not only be looking at the science behind how the GMO works, but also to the limitations of this science. We will also discuss the importance of information literacy as a tool for effectively identifying and evaluating issues.
Our goal is that this MOOC will impact people's understanding of science, what it can and can't do, and how information is transmitted. The intent is not to influence how people feel about GMOs, but to give them the critical thinking and scientific literacy tools necessary to make informed decisions — and to understand the broader impacts of those decisions.Assess, understand and apply social science concepts as they affect the development and use of biotechnology products and processes

One way of answering this question is by looking through the lens of history, beginning with First Societies and extending to the 16th century. This course in architectural history is not intended as a linear narrative, but rather aims to provide a more global view, by focusing on different architectural "moments."
How did the introduction of iron in the ninth century BCE impact regional politics and the development of architecture? How did new religious formations, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, produce new architectural understandings? What were the architectural consequences of the changing political landscape in northern Italy in the 14th century? How did rock-cut architecture move across space and time from West Asia to India to Africa? How did the emergence of corn impact the rise of religious and temple construction in Mexico?
Each lecture analyzes a particular architectural transformation arising from a dynamic cultural situation. Material covered in lectures will be supplemented by readings from the textbook A Global History of Architecture.
Join us on a journey around the globe and learn how architecture has developed and interacted with the world’s culture, religion, and history.History and context of the important buildings that shaped our culture
History of technological advances that significantly impacted the development of architecture
Impacts of certain cultural and religious traditions on architecture

Comment la politique économique peut-elle rétablir ou contribuer à la bonne santé d’un pays ? Ces questions sont au cœur de la programmation financière. Nos cours de PPF (Programmation et politiques financières) vous permettront d’acquérir les bases nécessaires pour y répondre.
 
La programmation financière est un cadre qui permet d’analyser l’état actuel de l’économie, de prévoir la direction qu’elle prend, et de déterminer les politiques économiques qui peuvent en changer le cours.
 
La première partie du cours de PPF, présentée par l’Institut du FMI pour le développement des capacités, vous permettra d’acquérir les compétences de base indispensables pour mener à bien la programmation financière. Dans ce cours, vous découvrirez les principales caractéristiques des quatre grands secteurs macroéconomiques (réel, financier, extérieur et monétaire), vous apprendrez comment lire, interpréter et analyser les comptes de chacun d’eux, et vous comprendrez à quel point ils sont interdépendants.
(La deuxième partie du cours de PPF portera sur la formulation de projections de base et l’élaboration d’un programme d’ajustement.)
 
Au long de ce cours, les économistes du FMI vous guideront dans les comptes et dans l’analyse d’une économie. En outre du suivi de conférences sous forme de vidéos, vous serez appelés à répondre à des questions sur les concepts expliqués, à résoudre de brefs exercices pratiques, à réfléchir avec les autres participants sur l’évolution économique de votre pays, et à travailler sur les données d’un pays imaginaire. Les dossiers de lecture vous seront fournis.
 
Que vous soyez un cadre de la fonction publique chargé de dossiers économiques pour votre pays ou que votre travail repose sur l’exploitation de données économiques, ou tout simplement si vous souhaitez mieux comprendre l’évolution économique d’un pays, ce cours vous apportera une formation pratique en analyse macroéconomique, et nous attendons avec intérêt votre participation à ce fascinant apprentissage!

This is a research problem, to which STEM instructors can effectively apply their research skills and knowledge.
In this course, you will learn about the “teaching as research” framework. This framework is a deliberate, systematic, and reflective use of research methods used to develop and implement teaching practices that advance the learning experiences and outcomes of both students and teachers.
Participants will learn about effective teaching strategies and the research that supports them, as well as how to collect and analyze evidence of student learning.
This course is targeted to graduate students and post-doctoral fellows within STEM disciplines (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) that are seeking faculty careers at college and university.
The “Teaching as Research” framework is a core idea of The Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning (CIRTL), which is a National Science Foundation (NSF) funded network of research universities committed to preparing outstanding future faculty in STEM disciplines, with the ultimate goal of improving undergraduate STEM education in the U.S.Effective teaching strategies and the research that supports them

In this lab-based computer science course, explore the complexities of embedded systems and learn how to develop your own real-time operating system (RTOS) by building a personal fitness device with Bluetooth connectivity (BLE). An operating system (OS) is a software system that computers use to manage the resources of a computer. The OS decides which tasks are performed when and decides how resources are utilized. Simple embedded systems, which are a combination of electrical, mechanical, chemical, and computer components designed to perform a dedicated function, originally did not need an OS. However, as embedded systems have evolved, so have their complexities. To manage this, an RTOS is now required.
Embedded systems are often deployed in safety-critical situations such as automotive, military, industrial, and medical applications. In applications such as communications and consumer electronics, response time and processing speed are important. A real-time system not only needs to arrive at the correct answer, but must also get the correct answer at the correct time. A RTOS manages a computer's resources so that tasks are performed in a timely mannner.
In this computer science course, students will learn the design fundamentals of an RTOS from the bottom up and use these fundamentals to build practical real-time applications. We will provide a board support package (BSP), so students will be able to focus on the RTOS and Bluetooth network without needing prior experience in circuits and I/O device driver software. This is a hands-on project-based lab course, where you will incrementally build a personal fitness device with Bluetooth connectivity.
This course is intended for students and professional engineers wishing to improve their skills in the fields of embedded systems, product development, computer architecture, operating systems, and Bluetooth networks.
To complete this course, you will need to purchase a lab kit including a microcontroller board, an I/O board, and a Bluetooth module. Instructions about purchasing the kit and installing required software are at http://edx-org-utaustinx.s3.amazonaws.com/UT601x/RTOS.html .Enhance your embedded system skills

You will use the scientific method to evaluate claims, make sense of evidence, and understand why we so often make irrational choices. You will begin to rely on slow, effortful, deliberative, analytic, and logical thinking rather than fast, automatic, instinctive, emotional, and stereotypical thinking.
We will provide tools for how to think independently, how to be skeptical, and how to value data over personal experience.

We will start with discrete-time, binomial trees models, but most of the course will be in the framework of continuous-time, Brownian Motion driven models. A basic introduction to Stochastic, Ito Calculus will be given. The benchmark model will be the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model, but we will also discuss more general models, such as stochastic volatility models. We will discuss both the Partial Differential Equations approach, and the probabilistic, martingale approach. We will also cover an introduction to modeling of interest rates and fixed income derivatives.
I teach the same class at Caltech, as an advanced undergraduate class. This means that the class may be challenging, and demand serious effort. On the other hand, successful completion of the class will provide you with a full understanding of the standard option pricing models, and will enable you to study the subject further on your own, or otherwise.

The questions we will take up include: Is extreme poverty a thing of the past? What is economic life like when living under a dollar per day? Are the poor always hungry? How do we make schools work for poor citizens? How do we deal with the disease burden? Is microfinance invaluable or overrated? Without property rights, is life destined to be "nasty, brutish and short"? Should we leave economic development to the market? Should we leave economic development to non-governmental organizations (NGOs)? Does foreign aid help or hinder? Where is the best place to intervene? And many others.

At the end of this course, you should have a good sense of the key questions asked by scholars interested in poverty today, and hopefully a few answers as well.To identify and analyze some of the root causes of underdevelopment using principles of economics
To understand the unique constraints and trade-offs the poor face when making decisions

Literally meaning “Comprehensive Mirror in Aid of Governance,” Zizhi Tongjian is an annalistic-style history featuring the subjects of politics and the military as the main thread of narration. The collection has been cherished by scholars over numerous dynasties for its historical value and insight into governance, peace and stability.

This guided reading course will help learners deepen their understanding of Chinese history, in addition to applying Zizhi Tongjian’s ancient wisdom to modern-day governance. Because Zizhi TongJian is a rich, expansive text, this course is intended to remove colloquial barriers and help students gain a deeper understanding of Chinese history from Emperor Qin to Caocao and Emperor Taizong.

This introductory course seeks to enable you to understand the basic engineering tools used and tradeoffs encountered in the design of these communication systems.  
This course is divided into three parts. In Part 1, we examine the point-to-point link, which communicates information from a single transmitter to a single receiver. Part 2 examines how multiple transmitters can share the same physical channel. Part 3 discusses how information can be transmitted reliably from one station to another over a network that connects multiple stations. Online interactive exercises are included to help build your intuition.
This course was inspired by and built upon the course 6.02 Digital Communication Systems developed at MIT, which Prof Bertram Shi worked on during his sabbatical in 2009.Learn the point-to-point link which communicates information from a single transmitter to a single receiver.

As citizens, we want a fair trial before being punished for a crime; but as citizens, we want to stop terrorists before they attack us. As decision-makers, we value the advice we get from data-driven algorithms; but as decision-makers, we also worry about unintended bias. Many data scientists learn the tools of the trade and get down to work right away, without appreciating the possible consequences of their work.
This course focused on ethics specifically related to data science will provide you with the framework to analyze these concerns. This framework is based on ethics, which are shared values that help differentiate right from wrong. Ethics are not law, but they are usually the basis for laws.

Whether you seek a career in international health or medicine, volunteer to serve those less fortunate, or work in an institutional setting such as a clinic, hospital, or public health agency, it is important to understand the sources and movement of diseases.
The world continues to grow smaller, with international travel, a global economy, and a changing environment contributing to the emergence of new diseases and the spread of existing ones. Understanding these connections -- and how they impact the farthest reaches of the globe – is becoming an essential skill in international development, humanitarian assistance, business and commerce, and at all levels of healthcare.
The Ebola outbreak offers a window through which global health can be examined in a variety of disciplines. A Toronto medical center and Dallas hospital are far removed from the outbreaks of SARS in China and Ebola in Guinea, yet those diseases arrived and created crises within these facilities and beyond. Research has shown that health security contributes to civil order, economic growth, and stable governments. It has also demonstrated that every nation bears the economic and human burden of disease, illness, and injury.
The director general of the World Health Organization, multiple world leaders, and innumerable health authorities have called for greater awareness and leadership in global health. That journey begins here.Why local health issues affect us globally

Comment faire les bons choix stratégiques ? Ce cours proposera des réponses à ces questions au travers de nombreuses études de cas. Il vous fournira des outils et méthodes d’analyse indispensables pour comprendre les atouts ainsi que l’environnement concurrentiel des entreprises.
Il s’agit d’une approche originale qui s’adresse à chacun, qu’il soit directeur, cadre, entrepreneur, étudiant ou tout simplement désireux de savoir comment prendre des décisions réfléchies et cohérentes tout en poursuivant un objectif à long terme.
Ce cours est construit comme un voyage en 6 escales au pays « stratégie ». Tout comme le stratège, le voyageur doit décider, prévoir et planifier son itinéraire en demeurant flexible. Il doit tenir un cap et connaître sa destination, car comme le disait Sénèque : « il n’est pas de vent favorable à qui ne connaît pas son port ».
Why does one company succeed over another? How do you make the right strategic choices while developing your business? 
This course will provide you with the tools and methods of analysis needed to answer these important questions. Through numerous case studies, you will come to understand both the assets of companies and their competitive environment. This is an original approach, applicable to everyone from students to business executives, but also anyone curious about how to make informed decisions while pursuing well-defined, long-term goals.
The course takes a multi-faceted approach. As a strategist, you must decide, predict and plan your route while remaining flexible and open to change. You must stay the course and know your destination because, as the philosopher Seneca once said, “If one does not know to which port one is sailing, no wind is favourable.”Comprendre et décoder les principes fondamentaux du raisonnement stratégique, l’analyse de l’environnement concurrentiel, le diagnostic stratégique et l’évaluation de différentes options de développement.

But it also relates to what international organizations do and, increasingly, it concerns individuals, corporations, NGO’s and other non-state actors.
As the world becomes more interdependent and more complex, and as new institutions are put in place to make international law real and more effective, international law is an exciting expanding field. Never before has it been so much relied upon, used and developed. Despite their differences in size, power, culture, religion and ideologies, states rely on international law to cooperate and to coexist; they speak the language of international law and international law serves them as an important common language.
The course will extensively rely on judgments and advisory opinions of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations (UN).
Having acquired this basic knowledge of international law, you’ll find it easier to study by yourself in books or through other courses or MOOCs some sub-fields of international law, like international humanitarian law, investment law, human rights or refugee law.
So, if you want to understand what is international law, what role it plays in the world of today, how it can be used or if you want to be able to discern legal arguments within the flow of international news and reports, this course is for you.How and by whom international law is made, by whom it must be respected and how it is applied

Marketing is one of the most misunderstood disciplines in management today. It is commonly used as a synonym for activities related to shopping, but it goes far beyond selling a product. In addition, many people believe they are experts in marketing, having shopped for various items all their lives and having been exposed to many advertisements.
In this introductory marketing course, you will learn the theories of marketing through practice (examples and illustrations). This course will explain what marketing management is all about in the simplest of terms and lay the foundation to your pathway to excellence in the wonderful world of marketing.Basic concepts of marketing

No national literature has ever grown up in isolation from the cultures around it; from the earliest periods, great works of literature have probed the tensions, conflicts, and connections among neighboring cultures and often more distant regions as well.
Focusing particularly on works of literature that take the experience of the wider world as their theme, this course will explore the varied artistic modes in which great writers have situated themselves in the world, helping us to understand the deep roots of today's intertwined global cultures.

Presented by Berklee Institute for Creative Entrepreneurship founder Panos Panay, this course features interviews with world renown entrepreneurs, innovators, songwriters, producers, creative directors, educators, performers, visual artists and chefs as they discuss parallels between the creative and entrepreneurial journeys.
The course approaches entrepreneurship as a creative process, a fundamental human instinct that we all possess and can unlock. Creativity &amp; Entrepreneurship applies concepts from the creative and musical creation process, such as observing, prototyping, iterating and embracing failure, as a means of guiding you through the concept of thinking like a startup. You will develop the basic mindset, knowledge, and insights required to pursue an entrepreneurial career, whether as the steward of your own career or as the founder of a new business in any field.
Creativity &amp; Entrepreneurship is about the side of entrepreneurship you won’t learn at a business school but, instead, in the music studio.

Comment l’urbanisation, la mobilité, Internet et la mondialisation ont-ils influencé notre perception du temps et de l’espace? Ce cours a pour objectif de définir la notion d’espace en apportant des clés de lecture pour comprendre les sociétés qui nous entourent.
À la fois théorique et pratique, ce cours privilégie les compétences sur les « contenus » factuels et valorise une approche par l’intelligence collective. Ce cours propose de saisir la notion d’espace à partir de vos expériences quotidiennes, de vos perceptions et de vos pratiques.
Dans EspaceX, nous explorons ensemble la ville, l’urbanisation, l’urbanité, et l’urbanisme, l’acteur individuel au sein d’un Monde mondialisé, les spatialités numériques, le couple espace-temps et la relation complexe entre les sociétés et les mondes bio-physiques. Une large part sera accordée à la cartographie. À l’issue de ce cours, vous serez capable non seulement de lire, mais aussi de dessiner vos propres cartes. Enfin, les problématiques de l’agir spatial et de la justice spatiale seront abordées. Un(e) specialiste reconnu(e) interviendra à chacune des 9 séances sous la forme d’un entretien filmé mettant en lumière la relation de ce chercheur à l’espace.Une meilleure compréhension du concept d’«espace » établie à partir de nos pratiques quotidiennes

How have urbanisation, mobility, digital spaces, and globalization changed the way we perceive it? This course aims to help you feel comfortable with the notion of space. The simplest way to understand it is to connect your daily life, your perceptions and your practices to the concepts of contact and remoteness. In SpaceX, we will explore together the city, urbanisation, urbanity, and urbanism, the individual actor in a globalising World, the emerging digital spatialities, the space-time couple, and the complex relation between societies and bio-physical worlds. Moreover, we will see that cartography is a powerful tool. By the end of the course, we will enable you to not only read but also draw your own maps. Finally, the issues of action on space through spatial agency and spatial justice will be addressed. In each of the nine sessions, a recognised specialist will be filmed in a particular place—a ‘thinking place’—throughout the World, to help us simultaneously inhabit and understand space.A greater understanding of space as perception and daily-life practice.
How to read and draw maps to gain a better understanding of space and spatiality.
How space is a useful tool to address digital worlds, urbanisation, and globalisation.

After a short study of ultrasound imaging, you will learn about the different X-ray imaging techniques. The understanding of the interaction of X-rays with tissue will lead to the study of three different techniques:
Computed Tomography (CT)
Emission Tomography
Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
This course shows how existing physical principles transcend into bio-imaging and establish an important link into life sciences, illustrating the contributions physics can make to life sciences. Practical examples will be shown to illustrate the respective imaging modality, its use, premise and limitations, and biological safety will be touched upon.
During this course, you will develop a good understanding of the mechanisms leading to tissue contrast of the bio-imaging modalities covered in this course, including the inner workings of the scanner and how they define the range of possible biomedical applications. You will be able to judge which imaging modality is adequate for specific life science needs and to understand the limits and promises of each modality.
To learn more about biomedical imaging, join us in the second part of this course Biomedical Imaging: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).Understand the main imaging concepts that characterize the quality of imaging techniques for Signal (SNR) and Contrast (CNR).
Understand the essential principles of ultrasound, X-ray imaging (CT), SPECT, PET.
For each of the above techniques, be aware of the factors limiting the image quality.

As demand grows and Internet piracy wanes, ad-supported and subscription models will generate unprecedented revenues that will surpass even the best of past earnings. And, many astute “music industry-watchers” predict a steep rise in business activity and trade earnings by the end of the decade.
Whether you’re a music creator, consumer, or facilitator of this process, you’ll want to understand the history, underpinnings, and basics of the music business. This course has been developed to provide students with the latest instruction on the best way for creators, consumers, and facilitators to navigate the resurgence of one of the world’s most exciting industries: the music business. Course author John Kellogg—administrator, educator, entertainment lawyer, performer, and radio and television personality—offers students the opportunity to learn the fundamental principles of the developing new music business, for now and into the future.The basic history of the music industry and today's business trends

We cover the three main programming paradigms: functional, object-oriented, and declarative dataflow.
The two courses are targeted toward people with a basic knowledge of programming. It will be most useful to beginning programming students, but the unconventional approach should be insightful even to seasoned professionals.
Louv1.1x covers fundamental concepts. You’ll learn functional programming, its techniques and its data structures. You’ll use simple formal semantics for all concepts, and see those concepts illustrated with practical code that runs on the accompanying open-source platform, the Mozart Programming System.
Louv1.2x covers data abstraction, state, and concurrency. You’ll learn the four ways to do data abstraction and discuss the trade-offs between objects and abstract data types. You’ll be exposed to deterministic dataflow, the most useful paradigm for concurrent programming, and learn how it avoids race conditions.

Standards also fuel compatibility and interoperability, reduce costs and risk, simplify product development, enable innovation, hasten time-to-market for new products – and can help determine a company’s global competitiveness. Standards play a vital role in helping consumers understand and compare competing products, and give confidence to investors.
This course will enable learners to better contribute to their organization and to advance their careers. By completing this course, learners will understand:
different types of standards
how they impact trade and innovation
how they evolve
why companies participate in standards development
how standards change to meet emerging needs
how to integrate related activities with other organizational functions
strategic implications
how standards apply to product design and planning.
We will also discuss conformity assessment, regulation and intellectual property.
This engineering course offers a practitioner’s view of technical standards and is geared to students and professionals in the fields of engineering, technology, computing, business, economics and law – particularly those working in all facets of product planning, development, and support.What technical standards are and why they matter globally
How standards develop through formal and informal processes and negotiation
How standards apply to product design and innovation
The connection between standards, strategic planning, and business success
Important intellectual property considerations related to standards and conformity requirements</description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>142</course_id><title>JuryX: Deliberations for Social Change</title><published_date>2016-08-01T10:24:42-04:00</published_date><course_length>7 weeks</course_length><effort>2-3 hours per week</effort><subject>Law</subject><price>FREE

What does it mean to be a citizen? It means to participate in your society, to connect with others, and to decide, with them, the issues that you face.
It starts with you.
We need to learn to talk civilly with each other about the issues of consequence, but are we capable of learning how to speak together, listen together, and decide together?
In JuryX: Deliberations for Social Change, an experiment in online civic discourse, you are invited to engage with Professor Nesson and others with an understanding that each of us starts from a place of anonymity. Through a series of asynchronous and synchronous online group activities, you will explore a deliberative system by which emotionally charged issues can be discussed.
Although you will learn a bit about the history of jury and even serve as a member of a virtual jury for a mock criminal case, this experiment is about active participation in the deliberative process and how you might use that framework to facilitate dialogue within your own affinity group or community.
The program consists of six modules. Each week, you will learn and apply a new step in a system designed to foster meaningful dialogue. Starting with an introduction to the course’s deliberative framework, you will move from a traditional jury-based application to a live social issue unfolding in real time: the Massachusetts referendum for the “Legalization, Regulation, and Taxation of Marijuana.” As citizens of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts deliberate on this issue, so will you and your JuryX peers. What arguments will shape this debate, and what will the final outcome be?
Can we, civilly, discuss an issue like marijuana regulation?
Two synchronous small-group online deliberations will be held using Google Hangout. Participation is optional, but highly recommended.
JuryX: Deliberations for Social Change is, ultimately, about the most fundamental of human interactions: communication. By listening, speaking, persuading, and being persuaded, you will learn about yourself and others.
If you have faith, faith will be given to you.

Relying on content learning and user engagement/satisfaction, this game will help identify the key areas that the students need to work on and actively improve on those weaknesses. The course element comes with a user guide and lesson planning tips for teachers. Don’t Endanger the Owls is a collaboration between the instructors of Rice University’s Responsible Conduct of Research Graduate Course and Rice’s Environmental Health and Safety and the Center for Technology in Teaching &amp; Learning staff.

This laboratory safety game may be used to reinforce laboratory safety concepts in various courses such as the Responsible Conduct of Research and various laboratory-based courses. On its own, this game does not fully satisfy the laboratory safety training required by federal agencies and therefore should be viewed as a supplemental resource to help bolster such training. </description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>144</course_id><title>Liderando el Desarrollo Sostenible de las Ciudades</title><published_date>2015-12-22T22:39:25-05:00</published_date><course_length>6 semanas</course_length><effort>6 horas por semana</effort><subject>Business &amp; Management</subject><price>FREE

ciento de la población en América Latina y el Caribe vive en zonas urbanas, y para el 2050 será casi el 90 por ciento. Esta creciente urbanización plantea desafíos importantes para los más de 15 mil municipios que existen en la región, exigiendo a los mismos hacer frente a las demandas de nuevos empleos, servicios urbanos, escuelas, transporte, viviendas y seguridad de forma consciente y planificada. Estas ciudades quieren avanzar hacia el desarrollo sostenible, buscando la manera de crecer económicamente, de forma inclusiva y respetando el medioambiente. ¿Pero cómo se avanza hacia el sueño de la sostenibilidad? ¿Cómo conseguimos crear actividad económica sin contaminar el aire y los ríos? ¿Cómo podemos crear riqueza y que los recursos lleguen a todas las personas? ¿Cómo hacer ciudades más seguras y participativas?
Para reflexionar sobre estas y otras preguntas, el BID ha creado un curso que busca fortalecer en los participantes las capacidades para gestionar el desarrollo sostenible de las ciudades, a través del dominio conceptual, procedimental y actitudinal de las principales áreas de competencia de la ciudad y de la herramienta de la Iniciativa de Ciudades Emergentes y Sostenibles del BID, permitiéndoles desarrollar habilidades y construir estrategias innovadoras y multisectoriales para dar respuesta a los desafíos de la sostenibilidad.
La preparación de este curso fue financiada por el Fondo de Fortalecimiento de la Capacidad Institucional (ICSF), gracias al aporte del Gobierno de la República Popular de China.Conocer el concepto de desarrollo sostenible y sus principales retos
Entender la importancia de la perspectiva multi/intersectorial en la gestión del desarrollo sostenible
Conocer la herramienta de la Iniciativa de Ciudades Emergentes y Sostenibles y su contribución al desarrollo sostenible de las ciudades
Identificar desafíos que enfrentan las ciudades de la Región en temáticas relacionadas con la sostenibilidad

América Latina passou de 41% a 79%. Caso esta tendência se mantenha, a taxa de urbanização em 2030 será de cerca de 90%, fazendo da região a mais urbanizada do planeta.
Essa tendência consolida a cidade como o centro do desenvolvimento econômico e humano da região. A cidade está criando trabalho, está inovando, está repensando seus sistemas de saúde e educação, transporte, está fazendo frente às mudanças do clima, está abrindo espaços para o debate e a socialização. Para que esse dinamismo possa traduzir-se em um fenômeno exitoso, a cidade deve aprender a planejar seu presente pensando em seu futuro, buscando o equilíbrio entre crescimento econômico, a inclusão social e o respeito ao meio ambiente. É, portanto, responsabilidade das cidades melhorar a qualidade de vida das gerações presentes sem comprometer o bem estar das gerações futuras.
Com o objetivo de responder a este desafio, o BID criou um curso que busca fortalecer os conhecimentos e capacidades dos participantes em gerir o desenvolvimento sustentável de suas cidades. E para isso, o curso parte da premissa que a sustentabilidade das cidades só será alcançada por meio de uma perspectiva integrada e intersetorial; uma perspectiva integral, onde se trabalhe de maneira conjunta os desafios econômicos, fiscais, urbanos, ambientais, institucionais e de governabilidade das cidades junto com uma perspectiva intersetorial, onde as diferentes áreas e níveis de governo se coordenem e que se articulem com o setor privado e com a sociedade civil.
Com o objetivo de entender melhor essa perspectiva, o curso analisa a situação, os desafios setoriais e intersetoriais que as cidades encontram na gestão das principais áreas de sua competência: finanças subnacionais, desenvolvimento produtivo, planejamento urbano, transporte, segurança cidadã, água, ar etc. Desta forma, com o objetivo de abordar o planejamento do desenvolvimento sustentável das cidades médias latino americanas, o curso apresenta a “Iniciativa Cidades Emergentes e Sustentáveis”, uma ferramenta de gestão que permite dar sentido ao trabalho analítico das dimensões/desafios de forma integrada.
Assim como na América Latina e no Caribe, o Brasil possui grandes desafios ambientais, urbanos e fiscais para a sustentabilidade de suas cidades. Dentre eles se destacam os altos índices de violência - 25,8 mortes violentas por 100 mil habitantes segundo o Fórum Brasileiro de Segurança Pública; a desigualdade urbana, uma vez que o país é o 4º mais desigual da América Latina e Caribe; e a vulnerabilidade diante de desastres naturais, onde se calcula, por exemplo, que a reconstrução das cidades cariocas devastadas pelas enchentes e pelos deslizamentos de 2011 custou 1,3% do PIB do estado do Rio de Janeiro; ou ainda, degradação ambiental, com um índice de 63% de esgoto sendo lançado nos corpos hídricos sem nenhum tratamento, segundo o MCidades.
Além de fornecer conceitos e uma visão abrangente da situação do Brasil em relação à sustentabilidade das cidades, neste curso serão abordados alguns desafios dos municípios, bem como exemplos práticos de como esses problemas estão sendo enfrentados.O desenvolvimento sustentável das cidades e a importância da abordagem multi/intersetorial para enfrentar os desafios da sustetabilidade

Virtually every day brings news about some “miracle food” that we should be consuming or some "poison" we should be avoiding. One day it's tomatoes to prevent cancer, then flaxseed against heart disease or soybeans for menopause. At the same time, we are warned about trans fats, genetically modified foods, aspartame and MSG. Dietary supplements are often touted as the key to health or a factor in morbidity. According to some, dairy products are indispensable while others urge us to avoid them. The same goes for meat, wheat and soy; the list goes on.
This course will shed light on the molecules that constitute our macro and micronutrients and will attempt to clarify a number of the food issues using the most relevant, up-to-date science available. Other topics to be presented will include the diet-cancer relationship, the link between diet and cardiovascular disease, food-borne illnesses, food additives and weight control.The foundations of a healthy diet

there where the soul of man is cleansed,
made worthy to ascend to Heaven.
-Purgatorio, Canto I, lines 4-6
While Hell is “black, confined, stinking, noisy, and suffocating, the great Mountain of Purgatory rises in pure sunlit solitude out of the windswept southern sea.” (Sayers, Purgatorio; Introduction)  Dante has undergone a conversion which has, literally, turned his world upside down.
Sadly, the majority of Dante’s readers do not accompany him beyond his escape from the Inferno, in part, perhaps, because of an instinctive anticipation that when the excitement of adventure is over, then the hard work of maturation must begin. Indeed, there is work aplenty on Mount Purgatorio, but there is also so much more. There is day and night, labor and rest, waking and dreaming, all the rhythms of diurnal living; but above all, there is the delight of hope. All that the penitent souls suffer here, they undergo in the eagerness of passionate yearning to be healed of the wounds of sin inflicted on them as part of the universal heritage of humanity. Purgatory is a “school of contemplation,” where the healing of wounds coincides with learning to suffer the weight of responsibility for one’s own identity as a person. For those willing to undertake the steep ascent of Dante’s seven-story Mountain, nowhere in the legacy of human culture is the process of becoming a “whole person” more closely observed or rendered with deeper psychological and social insight than in the cantos of Dante’s Purgatorio.
For us as modern readers, Mount Purgatorio is a steep ascent indeed, and if fewer of us accept this challenging invitation than do for the careen through Hell, then it should come as no surprise for us to learn of the untold years, centuries perhaps, that the souls whom Dante meets there require to complete their climb. A realistic willingness to suffer consciously and voluntarily, motivated by authentic hope, is hardly recognized as a possibility by most of us today for whom security and prosperity are accepted as the unqualified goals of our striving. Even to consider an alternative of the sort which Dante offers us in the Purgatorio is already a notable achievement, but one which the imaginative power of Dante’s poetry here places within our reach. Do not let the opportunity pass you by.
In this course, you will be asked to participate in learning activities on both edX and on MyDante, an innovative platform for deep reading that emphasizes mindfulness and contemplative reading habits as key to deriving lasting meaning from poetic texts. We begin on September 28 with an optional reading week. If you have not previously worked with the MyDante platform and are not familiar with the Contemplative Reading approach to the text which it is meant to support, the week offers a chance for you to become acquainted with MyDante and the practice of contemplative reading before we begin the course in earnest on October 5. Equally important, if you have not already read Inferno, we strongly suggest you do so before beginning Purgatorio. It is possible to read, understand and enjoy Purgatorio without having read the Inferno, but it is also true that familiarity with the first part of the journey will increase both your understanding and your enjoyment of the second. Finally, if you were with us for the Inferno, then we urge you to read through the Purgatorio in the reading mode of MyDante, or even as much as you can, during this week. The basic premise of contemplative reading is that re-reading is the best way to read. Try it; we are very sure you will agree.Gain familiarity with the theory and practice of “Contemplative Reading” that constitutes one of the principal structural dynamics of Liberal Arts education.
Apply the general practice of “Contemplative Reading” to Dante’s Divine Comedy.
Demonstrate in-depth and relatively advanced familiarity with and knowledge of an epic poem of the highest cultural significance; in specific, Dante’s Divine Comedy.
Begin to articulate for themselves their own personal convictions in response to reflection questions about human dignity, freedom and responsibility with which the Divine Comedy inevitably confronts its readers.
Engage with the most fundamental goal of Liberal education, promoting the universal dignity of personhood.

This environmental context molds the country’s objectives, defines the country’s strategy, programs and policies for achieving objectives, and significantly impacts companies.
The context is affected by historical events, and by the country’s leadership. Many stakeholders shape the environment and the institutions, or “rules of the game”, that affect business. Labor, students, farmers, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the military play a crucial role, making the analysis of country environments complex and fascinating.
We will study Japan in some depth, and catch brief glimpses of South Korea, Singapore, Chile, Turkey, India, South Africa and the former Soviet Union, to appreciate the forces that influence diverse country environments, and companies’ strategies.
The course will review aspects of global institutions, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), which set global rules that profoundly affect business strategy and human welfare. It will also explore opportunities and challenges at the bottom of the pyramid, the last frontier for value creation by companies and NGOs.How social, political, economic and institutional factors define the business environment of countries

We will address themes in your personal and professional life and show you how to counsel at all stages. We start with a positive approach by giving attention to people’s talents. We recognize that human existence involves constraints and difficulties, which is why this course is based on the idea of “existential” well-being.
This course will teach you how to live fully as a human being, in this body, on this planet, while at the same time being conscious that you are just a small part of a vast, incomprehensible, universe.
Our experiential approach focuses on the innate wisdom of the human organism and our tendency to evolve in a forward-moving direction. You will learn how to become aware of this deeply felt knowledge by giving attention to your body as felt from the inside and to your emotions.
Our person-centered approach encourages building optimal human relationships through empathy, respect and authenticity. These are complex skills, which we will bring within your reach by means of simple exercises.
Through examples, role-play and video-demonstrations we will illustrate how you can apply our existential well-being approach in a variety of helping contexts, including counseling and psychotherapy. You will develop skills to embody the existential well-being approach as a person and as a professional.
Your learning will be enriched through exchanging thoughts and experiences with a diverse group of international participants. You will learn to notice how people from different cultures have different ideas about what it means to live well and meaningfully. You will engage in discussions where divergent values can be respectfully acknowledged. Your personal view of well-being will expand and deepen to a more universal perspective on what it means to be human.
This course is taught by instructors with decades of experience in existential psychotherapy, focusing -oriented and emotion-focused therapy, person-centered counseling and positive psychology.
The instructors are also teachers and researchers in the fields of psychotherapy, positive psychology, meaning and spirituality at KU Leuven, a prestigious European University.
This course offers you a high degree of flexibility. You can follow the content in sequence or choose to complete sections in order of interest to you. Be aware that it would be realistic to spend 6 to 8 hours on each section. The course will be available from October until the end of June and you can follow your own rhythm in studying and practicing what is offered in each section.Live meaningfully and make the best of different life situations

Are you dealing with measurements or big data, but are you unsure about how to proceed? This is the course that teaches you how to find the best estimates of the unknown parameters from noisy observations. You will also learn how to assess the quality of your results.
TU Delft’s approach to observation theory is world leading and based on decades of experience in research and teaching in geodesy and the wider geosciences. The theory, however, can be applied to all the engineering sciences where measurements are used to estimate unknown parameters.
The course introduces a standardized approach for parameter estimation, using a functional model (relating the observations to the unknown parameters) and a stochastic model (describing the quality of the observations). Using the concepts of least squares and best linear unbiased estimation (BLUE), parameters are estimated and analyzed in terms of precision and significance.
The course ends with the concept of overall model test, to check the validity of the parameter estimation results using hypothesis testing. Emphasis is given to develop a standardized way to deal with estimation problems. Most of the course effort will be on examples and exercises from different engineering disciplines, especially in the domain of Earth Sciences.
This course is aimed towards Engineering and Earth Sciences students at Bachelor’s, Master’s and postgraduate level.

Are you eager to improve project performance and want to expand your knowledge?
This business and management course will focus on the necessary project management skills to successfully manage projects, distinguishing three areas:
The project manager and the team
The project process
The project context
The course focuses on the early project phases, including examples from technical projects within various sectors and industries (amongst others, but not limited to, infrastructure projects and construction projects).
At the end of this course, you will have created your own project execution plan, either in a team effort or on individual basis. Of course the team effort allows for a special learning experience and we appraise active team participation

Do you know why a surfing suit keeps you warm? Why iron feels cold, while wood feels warm at room temperature? Or how air is transferred into aqueous liquids in a water treatment plant? How can we sterilize milk with the least amount of energy? How does medicine spread in our tissue? Or how do we design a new cooling tower of a power plant? All these are phenomena that involve heat transfer, mass transfer or fluid flow. 
Transport Phenomena investigates such questions and many others, exploring a wide variety of applications ranging from industrial processes to environmental engineering, to transport processes in our own body and even simple daily life problems
 
In this course we will look into the underlying concepts of these processes, that often take place simultaneously, and will teach you how to apply them to a variety of real-life problems. You will learn how to model the processes and make quantitative statements.  
FAQ
Is there a book required for the course?
The course uses materials and software that are freely available online. A useful reference book is: Harry Van den Akker &amp; Robert F. Mudde, Transport Phenomena (Delft Academic Press, 2014, ISBN: 978-90-6562-3584).
I just want to learn the basics of Transport Phenomena (TP). Do I really need to spend 8 hours per week for 7 weeks?
We offer this course for everyone who wants to use TP in their education or professional life and for anyone who just has an interest in it. Each week we will give a short overview of the course elements and indicate how to take a ‘quick route’. You can decide how you want to go through this course, depending on the topic, your background and the time available. 
If I miss a week, does that affect my performance?
You can study at your own pace as long as you finish before the final deadline. However, some assignments and discussions are primarily active and monitored during the scheduled period.

However, today's infrastructure systems are drastically changing. They are becoming more and more web-based, interconnected and transnational, with increasingly fragmented public and private ownership, while new technologies are on their way. The capital need for investment in new infrastructures and upgrading of ageing infrastructures is tremendous.
During this infrastructure course you will learn to examine these challenges from a new, combined engineering and social sciences perspective. Subsequently we will focus on the challenges that complex adaptive infrastructure systems pose for governance, management and decision-making in a world full of uncertainties. In the last part of the course, we will introduce a selection of topics and tools (modeling &amp; simulation, value sensitive design, standards, ICT-architecture) which will help you to improve the adequacy of infrastructure systems and services, while dealing with the risks and vulnerabilities of infrastructure interdependencies.
In our case studies, we will focus on topical developments and policies, such as sustainable energy transition (including smart grids), urbanization and its impact on infrastructures, the challenges of climate change and water scarcity, and the phenomenon of inverse infrastructure development (self-organization).  
If you are interested or involved in the functioning of today's and tomorrow's infrastructures, this course is an exceptional learning opportunity, whether you are a student or a professional. You will be interacting with peers all over the world and we will present a large number of case studies.
The course is based on the results of an extensive and renowned international research programme titled 'Next Generation Infrastructures' (NGInfra).

Where diseases were clearly understood, and where treatments obviously worked on most patients, such as penicillin for pneumonia, there was no need to delve deeper into questions of effectiveness. But for most conditions, the treatment benefits were modest and there was a need for improved ways of telling whether a new intervention was better than the previous standard treatment. And so scientists introduced a testing procedure for new treatments - the randomized controlled trial.
As the cost of developing new treatments grew, it became very important to detect the slightest improvement that could be attributed to the new drug in order to get it licensed and marketed. So the usual randomized trial was answering the following question: does this treatment work (for otherwise well people with just this single disease, with perfect adherence, treated by the best doctors, under idealised conditions)? But most patients have multiple diseases, imperfect adherence, ordinary doctors and non-ideal circumstances. These patients want to know whether a new treatment is likely to reduce important harms for ordinary people like them, receiving usual care. This mismatch meant that most trials were overestimating the real world effectiveness of new interventions.
In this MOOC, we are going to study this mismatch, and see what its effect is on modern medical care. One example of the studies we will discuss is the VIGOR trial. This influential drug trial resulted in the widespread global overuse of this drug, at a cost of wasted billions of dollars. Ironically, this drug, intended to reduce a problem in individuals, ended up causing more of the same problem in the population!
After we understand the consequences of designing the wrong kinds of trials, we will also look at how best to design pragmatic randomized trials, which answer the important questions that ordinary patients and decision makers in the real world most often ask. We will also explore how these can be combined with economic evaluations and qualitative research – to answer important questions about how much these interventions cost, and how they are experienced by the recipients.The principles of pragmatic randomized controlled trials (pRCTs) in combination with economic and qualitative methods, and how to apply these to develop your own research proposal

Pero la realidad es que en las últimas décadas hemos sufrido crisis alimentarias muy importantes, tanto desde una perspectiva económica, con grandes pérdidas para productores y distribuidores, como sobre todo desde una perspectiva social, con un elevado número de fallecidos a lo largo de toda Europa. A través de este curso podrás conocer las respuestas adoptadas por la Unión Europea: la primacía del conocimiento científico sobre los criterios económicos; la colaboración de la industria alimentaria en la garantía de la seguridad; la adopción de procedimientos autorizatorios y de alerta ante situaciones de crisis; y la reparación de los daños generados por tales crisis.
Este curso se imparte en español, si bien alguno de los documentos de referencia pueden aparecer en ingles (aunque se incluirá una breve explicación en español). No se requiere conocimiento jurídico previo alguno.Los principios básicos de la seguridad alimentaria en la Unión Europea (precaución, trazabilidad)

la conception d’un produit
la fixation du prix auquel celui-ci sera vendu
la sélection des canaux de distribution pour la vente
le choix des moyens de communication par lesquels l’entreprise va informer ses clients.
Ces décisions s’appuient bien sûr sur des analyses mobilisant des concepts importants que nous vous présenterons. Tout au long du MOOC, vous aurez l’occasion d’appliquer la théorie à une étude de cas réel qui vous placera dans la peau d’un décideur marketing. Vous bénéficierez aussi d’interviews d’experts et d’échanges privilégiés et interactifs avec les professeurs lors de conférences en direct. 
 
Tous les jours, consommez-vous des biens ou des services ? Ce MOOC vous permettra de saisir la logique du marketing et de devenir un consommateur plus responsable.
Etes-vous un praticien non encore averti en marketing ? Ce MOOC vous permettra de comprendre le pourquoi des décisions du marketing opérationnel et de les mettre en œuvre dans un cas concret.
Etes-vous étudiant et curieux ? Ce MOOC vous permettra de vous familiariser avec les pratiques du marketing, dans les secteurs marchands et non marchands.
 
Etes-vous un étudiant en gestion ? Ce MOOC vous offrira un complément aux cours de stratégie et de marketing stratégique. Il vous permettra d’opérationnaliser les décisions dans quatre composantes classiques à savoir le produit, la distribution, le prix et la communication (les « 4 P »).
 
Que vous soyez consommateur, praticien ou étudiant, ce MOOC vous offrira un regard éclairé sur l’éthique du marketing.

Avec le partenariat des éditions Dunod pour l'ouvrage Lambin, J.-J., &amp; de Moerloose, C. (2012). Marketing stratégique et opérationnel. Du marketing à l'orientation-marché (8ème édition).
  This class will provide you with an overview of the various dimensions of operational marketing (marketing decisions). These decisions concern product development, setting of a price for this product, selecting one or several distribution channels and finally communication tools in order to promote this product. Of course, these decisions rest on conceptual concepts that we will also present. You will have the opportunity to concretely apply course content through weekly case studies for which you will play the role of a manager. This MOOC provides content through videos, quiz, expert interviews, a forum, discussion (hangouts) and additional readings.
 
To consumers, this class will offer you an understanding of the logic behind marketing and it will enable you to become a more aware and responsible consumer.
 
To practitioners with no marketing background, this MOOC will enable you to understand the reasoning behind marketing decisions and to apply this reasoning in real situations.
 
To students with no business background, this MOOC will help you to become familiar with marketing practices both in commercial and non-profit marketing and to understand and analyze important operational decisions in marketing.
 
To business students, this MOOC will be complementary to strategy and marketing strategy classes. It will enable you to operationalize decisions using the 4 ‘P’s’: Price, Product, Place and Promotion.
 
To everybody involved in this MOOC, the ethical issues in Marketing will be highlighted.

Desplegará las grandes cosmovisiones occidentales en base a sus ideas rectoras, operativas en los estadios científico, artístico y sociocultural, haciendo ver cómo la filosofía ha servido de sustrato o conexión de todas estas manifestaciones espirituales, estableciendo una sistemática efectiva, patente en la atmósfera cultural de las épocas-mundo. Cada uno de estos “mundos” (en el sentido de “ordenación global”) está configurado por un conjunto bien trabado de ideas-fuerza, en torno a una Idea fundamental.
El alumno obtendrá una visión general de la cohesión interna y organización de cada una de estas cosmovisiones, respecto a las cuales se pondrá el acento en su presencia activa en los problemas del presente.Dominar la terminología filosófica del idealismo

It is comprised of three parts, of which Part 1 introduces programming on the basis of familiar concepts, like calculators and games. This edition is an improved version of the course released in April 2015.
Powerful concepts such as functional abstraction, the object oriented programming (OOP) paradigm and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are progressively introduced throughout the five weeks. Examples and case studies are provided so that learners can implement simple programs on their own or collaborating with peers.
Part 2 will focus on how to write “good” programs, where “good” is to be understood from several perspectives: correctness, efficiency, software engineering techniques, and ethics.
Part 3 will deal with fundamental data structures, such as sequences, and algorithms on them, such as searching and sorting.
Emphasis is put on immediate feedback and on having a fun experience. Programming knowledge is not only useful to be able to program today’s devices such as computers and smartphones. It also opens the door to computational thinking, i.e. the application of computing techniques to every-day processes.Basic knowledge on algorithms and Java programming

Un espacio en el que su monarquía creó el primer imperio global de la Historia. Un tiempo, entre los siglos XVI y XVII, en el que su sociedad alcanzó la excelencia en las artes y las letras.

Aunque ese esplendor se dio en plenos aires de cambio. Pues España pasó de la hegemonía a la decadencia, de la expansión a la crisis.

Esta asignatura pretende trazar la historia de aquella época. Entre el Renacimiento y el Barroco su cultura marcó la pauta en Occidente. Las obras literarias -La Celestina, El Lazarillo, etc.- se tradujeron enseguida en las imprentas europeas y americanas. Las ropas marcaron la moda cortesana. La tendencia más fashion era “vestir a la española”. Los tratados militares y políticos fueron estudiados por los enemigos.

La acumulación de talentos en la Villa y Corte de Madrid (Cervantes, Lope, Velázquez, etc.), tuvo réplicas en las grandes ciudades de imperio. Pues en Sevilla, Lisboa, Barcelona, Nápoles, México o Lima se multiplicaron academias literarias, estrenos teatrales y fiestas. Una síntesis de pueblos unidos por la lealtad a la Corona y la fe católica.

En nuestro recorrido por esa España de El Quijote pasaremos de la campana al reloj y de la geografía fantástica a la real. La sociedad estuvo - Conocer la Historia de España en el Siglo de Oro a través de El Quijote como hilo conductor.
Adentrarnos en la vida cotidiana de los siglos XVI y XVII a través de la sociedad y la cultura.
Ofrecer al alumnado las fuentes escritas y visuales para que contemple el tiempo de El Quijote como si viviese en él.
Comparar los valores de la España de El Quijote con los actuales para comprender cómo han ido evolucionando a lo largo de la Historia polarizada entre los privilegiados -nobleza y clero- y los pobres y los picaros. El Humanismo fue cultivado en las universidades. La familia, la alimentación, la vivienda, los juegos y las fiestas, protagonizaron la vida cotidiana. 

En el tiempo de El Quijote las luces de los genios literarios y artísticos brillaron sobre las sombras de la Inquisición. Viajemos, pues, a esta excelsa cultura del Siglo de Oro.Conocer la Historia de España en el Siglo de Oro a través de El Quijote como hilo conductor

We will discuss where these beliefs, theories and practices originated from, how they were passed on over the ages and why some are still so central to large communities of believers across the world today, whether it be amongst Jews, Christians, Muslims, Buddhists or Shintoists.
We'll be dealing with everything from gods and spirits, to angels and demons, to afterlife and the netherworld, as well as the great cycles of the universe and the tremendous power of lunar and solar eclipses. The interpretation of dreams and all sorts of magic and miraculous deeds will also be covered during this course.
Students will have the opportunity to travel extensively in time and space. The comparative, critical and contextualized approach of this course will allow for a valuable and thought-provoking experience.

Mais négocier ce n’est pas se limiter à la recherche du bénéfice maximum. La négociation traverse toutes les dimensions de la vie humaine. Nous négocions tous les jours, dans toutes les sphères de notre existence : au travail, avec la famille, les amis… Dès qu’il s’agit de partager des biens matériels mais aussi de résoudre une divergence d’intérêts, de concilier différentes envies, rêves, goûts, couleurs…
 
Ce cours s’éloigne de l’approche classique des négociations et tente de rendre compte des phénomènes psychologiques à la base du comportement. L’approche poursuivie sera descriptive plutôt que prescriptive. Contrairement aux théoriciens du jeu qui « examinent ce que de super-hommes, ultra-intelligents et impeccablement rationnels devraient faire dans les situations compétitives », nous explorerons la façon dont « des êtres imparfaits se comportent dans la réalité » (Raïffa, 1982, p. 21). Ainsi, les êtres humains poursuivent des motivations, ont des attentes, des préjugés, des biais et des émotions. Ils analysent l’information qui leur est soumise et prennent des décisions à travers le spectre de leurs propres limites cognitives. Leurs actions fluctuent en fonction de la situation ou de leur personnalité. Toutes ces variables influencent non seulement le comportement des personnes mais, plus fondamentalement, elles modifient la dynamique même de résolution des divergences. Ce cours mettra en évidence ces variables multiples et offrira aux étudiants une compréhension fine et détaillée des processus psychologiques qui entrent en jeu avant, pendant et après toute négociation.
  Ce cours sera enseigné en français.
  Often confined to the study of techniques like selling a 24-volume encyclopedia to a recalcitrant octogenarian or to the art of haggling salary, negotiation is frequently approached from a purely utilitarian perspective. But motivations in negotiations are not limited to the pursuit of maximum profit. Negotiations concern all dimensions of human life. We negotiate every day, in all spheres of our lives: at work, with family, and with friends. We negotiate in attempts to share material goods, but also to solve divergence of interests, to reconcile different desires, dreams, tastes, and colors.
 
This course attempts to account for psychological phenomena at the basis of negotiation behaviors. Our approach will be descriptive rather than prescriptive. Unlike game theorists who “look at what ultra-smart and impeccably rational super-human beings should do in competitive situations,” we will explore how “imperfect beings behave in reality (Raïffa, 1982). Human beings pursue motivations, have expectations, show prejudice, display biases and emotions. They analyze information submitted to them and make decisions that are tainted by their cognitive limitations. Their actions fluctuate as a function of the situation they are embedded in, as well as their personality. All these variables influence not only the behavior of people, but more fundamentally, the very dynamic of negotiation instances. This course will highlight these multiple variables and offer students a detailed understanding of the psychological processes involved before, during, and after negotiation.

Desde que en 1954 se realizara el primer trasplante exitoso de un órgano, la cirugía de trasplantes se ha desarrollado espectacularmente brindando esperanza y calidad de vida a muchos enfermos. Mientras esas técnicas y posibilidades terapéuticas avanzan, persisten sin embargo muchos interrogantes sobre el modo en el que los órganos pueden obtenerse lícitamente. Algunos de esos dilemas nos acompañan desde siempre, otros son suscitados por la aparición de fenómenos novedosos como el turismo de trasplantes, las posibilidades que ofrece la donación tras la muerte cardiocirculatoria o los descubrimientos sobre las funciones fisiológicas remanentes en los pacientes diagnosticados en muerte cerebral. En la inmensa mayoría de los países no se pueden comprar y vender órganos. ¿Por qué? A pesar de que muchas personas siguen muriendo a la espera de recibir un órgano, en ningún país se confiscan los órganos de las personas fallecidas. ¿Por qué? ¿Pueden donar los menores? ¿Debemos prescindir de la conocida como “regla del donante cadáver” y permitir la eutanasia para la donación? ¿Con qué límites? ¿De qué manera influye la potencial condición de donante de un órgano en los cuidados que se proporcionan al final de la vida? ¿Cómo evitar el conflicto de intereses entre quienes velan por la vida de los futuros receptores de un órgano y quienes aún se afanan por cuidar a quien va a fallecer de manera irremisible e inminente?

En este curso nos adentraremos en el análisis de ésas y otras cuestiones, pero también introduciremos los nuevos desafíos que para la ética y el Derecho plantean trasplantes novedosos así como la discusión en torno a los criterios de justa distribución de los órganos
 
The first successful organ transplantation was performed in 1954. Since then, the technique has evolved tremendously, giving hope and increased quality of life to many patients around the world. While the technology and drugs advance, several controversies persist regarding the way in which organs may be obtained. Some of these dilemmas arose on the very first day in which organs’ transplantation originated; others have emerged as a result of new phenomena such as transplantation tourism, the new possibilities brought by donation after cardio-circulatory death, or increasing knowledge about the remaining physiological functions detected in patients pronounced as brain dead. Almost all countries in the world forbid the selling of organs. Why? Although many people die while on the waiting lists, in no country does the Government confiscate cadaveric organs. Why? May minors be organ donors? Should we abandon the so-called “dead donor rule” and allow “organ-donation euthanasia”? How does the potential condition of becoming a donor influence the administration of end-of-life care? How should we avoid the eventual conflict of interests between those who care for the life of future recipients of organs and those who are in charge of the dying patient-eventual-donor? In this course we will explore the answers to these questions, and we will also engage in the assessment of the more recent challenges posed by novel transplantation techniques, and, albeit briefly, in the discussion regarding the fair distribution of organs. Entender los desafíos jurídicos y éticos actuales que plantean los trasplantes de órganos / Understand the current ethical and legal challenges raised by organ transplantation.
Conocer las circunstancias clínicas que explican algunos dilemas morales / Grasp the clinical circumstances surrounding organ transplantation that explain those ethical and legal conundrums.

Is nuclear energy a good substitute for fossil fuels to reduce our CO2 emission or not?
Can nuclear reactors operate safely without any harm to the public and environment?
How much nuclear waste is produced and how long does it need to be stored safely?
How can we make nuclear energy clean and more sustainable?
How much are nuclear energy costs?
You will learn the physics behind nuclear science, how to gain energy from nuclear fission, how nuclear reactors operate safely, and the life cycle of nuclear fuel: from mining to disposal. In the last part of the course, we will focus on what matters most in the public debate: the economic and social impact of nuclear energy but also the future of energy systems.
Practically, we will:
Teach you about nuclear science and technology (radiation and radioactivity, nuclear reactions, nuclear reactors and fuel cycle, economics of nuclear energy, and the sociality aspects)
Show you short videos about the theory and practical implementation of nuclear energy
Stimulate discussion and debate about nuclear energy
Ask you to formulate your own opinion about nuclear energy and its role in society
The GENTLE consortium has sponsored and prepared this course. GENTLE is focused on maintaining the current high level of nuclear safety, and developing a highly skilled and well informed nuclear workforce, following the conclusion of the Council of the EU that it “it is essential to maintain in the European Union a high level of training in the nuclear field“ to deal with reactor fleet safely, decommission obsolete plants, be involved in new builds where policy dictates, and deal with the legacy and future radioactive wastes.

In the past, scientists often tried to understand them by examining each constituent part. However, this approach was unsuccessful in many cases because the parts of any complex biological system can “interact” with each other and understanding such interaction is critical.
In this biology and life sciences course you will learn about systems biology, a holistic approach to understanding biological complexity, focusing on how all of the parts of a system work together. This course will teach you the basic concepts of systems biology, including engineering principles and tools developed for dynamic systems (e.g., robots) to better model and understand biological dynamics.
You will learn how simple math operations, addition and multiplication, can be used to model and simulate dynamic biological behaviors. Different types of “gene circuits” will be modeled and simulated using Octave Online, a web-based programming tool.
This course is geared towards secondary/ high school STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) educators and students. Basic programming skills will be taught in a step-wise manner so no prior programming experience or knowledge is necessary.Key concepts of systems biology

But what makes a good learning game? Where do ideas come from and how do you create them? These are the questions that this course tries to answer.
The premise of learning games from some perspectives seems like a perfect and easy solution - get people to learn things they don’t want to by motivating them through game play. To others it seems like an oxymoron - if learning is hard then it can’t possibly be fun at the same time. The key to designing good learning games is to reconcile these perspectives by creating games that focus on creating environments based on “hard fun.” This idea will be a central tenet of this course.
Through six units comprising nine weeks, we will look at the evolution of educational video games and hear from experts working on many aspects of learning games from design to development to implementation. For the course project, participants will create their own learning game.

Proposing solutions to local problems requires grounding research in the local context and communicating clear solutions and calls for action that are understandable and relevant to local audiences.
Students will learn how to conduct research, write about a particular issue, and construct a call to action based upon their research.
This is a unique English course because students will directly learn about the power and pleasures of writing. By engaging with local questions and problems, students will have the opportunity to enter into important discussions and possibly create meaningful changes in the lives of those around them. Students will create a digital portfolio that enables them to publish and share their research and writing.
This course will interest individuals who want to learn more about how to create change in the world through research and writing. This class will also interest those who want to learn how to compose in a digital environment.
If you wish to earn university credit for the course, we will ask you to complete a portfolio in which you demonstrate what you have learned. Specifically, you will address what you have learned in the course and provide evidence that you have acquired the skills and knowledge taught during the course. Credit earned will count as ASU’s First-Year Composition course. However, it is strongly encouraged that you consult with your institution of choice to determine how these credits will be applied to their degree requirements prior to transferring the credit.Rhetorical Knowledge

How can you become an active user of this content, using, remixing and reinventing it for your research, lessons, and development?
Whether you are a student or teacher with an interest in cultural heritage, a GLAM professional, a developer or simply a cultural heritage enthusiast without prior technical knowledge, this MOOC is for you.
As the online availability of digital cultural heritage continues to grow, it becomes more and more important that users, from passive readers, learn to become active re-users. The mission of this course is to share the creative ways with which people use and re-use Europeana and digital cultural content, to demonstrate what Europeana can bring to the learning community, and to bring about the essential concept that cultural content is not just to contemplate, but to live and engage with.
The educational idea behind the E-Space MOOC is to lower barriers to the access and reuse of cultural heritage content on Europeana and similar sources, providing tutorials and trial versions of applications and tools alongside reading materials, useful tips and best practices gathered throughout the course of the project.
Every module (Photography, Open and Hybrid Publishing, TV, Dance, Museums, Intellectual Property for the Cultural Entrepreneur and Creative Marketing) is organized into three levels in order to satisfy the needs of all learners:
Level 1: Targets cultural heritage enthusiasts, students and teachers. The information provided here concerns digital cultural heritage in a broad sense; different kinds of content are presented and it is explained how to easily reuse them. No technical skills or understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the cultural sector are needed for this part.
Level 2: Targets GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives and museums) professionals. The information provided here requires a level of professional knowledge of the sector. The aim is to help GLAM professionals discover and understand the tools available - such as those on the E-Space platform and Europeana Labs - that can be used to enhance, remix, rethink, and play with collections in new and fascinating ways.
Level 3: Targets application developers. This is the most technical part of each module and it is intended as a way for developers to discover tools they can work with (e.g. the multiscreen toolkit, the Europeana APIs, etc.).
Digital cultural heritage is online and ready to be creatively reused by you. What are you waiting for? Click on enroll now and start learning!
This MOOC is based on the Europeana Space project, which has received funding from the European Union's ICT Policy Support Programme as part of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, under GA n° 621037 and aims to further the creative reuse of Europeana Content.How to become creative with digital cultural heritage

Es poco lo que se ha ganado en productividad y ha habido numerosos episodios de recesiones profundas, crisis bancarias, inflación desbordada y escasez de divisas. Todos estos factores afectan la calidad de vida en América Latina. En realidad, sólo con mayores niveles de crecimiento sostenido a través del tiempo, es posible pensar que América Latina supere la pobreza y mejore el nivel de vida de la región.
Este curso analiza los principales desafíos que la región enfrenta en cuanto a su crecimiento económico y estabilidad macroeconómica. Los contenidos serán presentados en un lenguaje simple y comprensible para no especialistas en el tema.
Este curso pretende abordar las siguientes preguntas: 
¿Cuáles son los desafíos que enfrentan los países en América Latina y el Caribe para incrementar sus niveles de inversión privada? 
¿Por qué la productividad en América Latina y el Caribe es más baja comparada con la de otras regiones? 
¿Cuáles son los principales desafíos que enfrenta la infraestructura, sea ésta la relacionada con agua y saneamiento básico, el transporte o la energía, para mencionar algunos sectores? 
¿Por qué los recursos naturales, que abundan en la región, no siempre han dado los resultados esperados para propiciar el desarrollo regional? 
¿Cómo se originan la inestabilidad económica y las crisis macroeconómicas? 
¿Cuál es el rol de las políticas monetarias, cambiarias y financieras para alcanzar estabilidad macroeconómica?

This course is the second of three in a series of mechanics courses from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at MIT. Taken together, these courses provide similar content to the MIT subject 3.032: Mechanical Behavior of Materials.
The 3.032x series provides an introduction to the mechanical behavior of materials, from both the continuum and atomistic points of view. At the continuum level, we learn how forces and displacements translate into stress and strain distributions within the material. At the atomistic level, we learn the mechanisms that control the mechanical properties of materials. Examples are drawn from metals, ceramics, glasses, polymers, biomaterials, composites and cellular materials.
Part 1 covers stress-strain behavior, topics in linear elasticity and the atomic basis for linear elasticity, and composite materials.
Part 2 covers stress transformations, beam bending, column buckling, and cellular materials.
Part 3 covers viscoelasticity (behavior intermediate to that of an elastic solid and that of a viscous fluid), plasticity (permanent deformation), creep in crystalline materials (time dependent behavior), brittle fracture (rapid crack propagation) and fatigue (failure due to repeated loading of a material).Concepts relating to stress transformation, including equivalent stresses, principal stresses, and maximum shear stress

Combinatorial mathematics is just the science to deal with combinations of discrete items. As an ancient field, the history of combinatorial mathematics can be traced back over 4000 years to the age of the Great Yu in ancient China. Today, combinatorial mathematics is regarded as the basis of computer science since the algorithms in programming heavily rely on the analysis of the discrete elements.
Instead of relying on the traditional mathematical "theorem - proof" format, this course demonstrates various principles in an intuitive manner with ancient stories, the scenes of movies and even a magic show. What you’ll learn:
The counting principles based on the basic operations “+”, “-”, “*”, “/”; 
Generating functions
Recurrent number serials such as Fibonacci number, Catalan number, and more
Pigeon hole principles
Inclusion and exclusion principles
Polya counting based on group theory
This course is based on a highly regarded on-campus Tsinghua class called Combinatorics, and is ideal for students who are interested in mathematics or computer science. Enroll today and learn the mathematical theory needed to solve the real-world problems!

Qu’appelle-t-on « familles » et comment se constituent-elles ? Quel regard et quels types d’analyse l’anthropologie propose-t-elle sur les systèmes de parenté, symboliques, politiques, religieux ?
L’anthropologie prospective nous aide à comprendre et à anticiper les phénomènes qui transforment nos modes de vie contemporains. Elle pose un regard transversal sur les actions, les pratiques et les dires des personnes avec lesquelles travaillent les chercheurs.
« Entrer en anthropologie », c’est accepter de changer son regard sur le monde et de se décentrer par rapport à ses habitudes. Si vous désirez comprendre un peu mieux le monde et ses changements contemporains, suivez ces chercheurs sur leur terrain et expérimentez d’autres repères culturels.
Durant ces quelques heures, vous serez amenés à débattre avec des professeurs et des étudiants autour de questions sur la famille, les migrations, les mondes virtuels ou encore les mondes des invisibles. Vous apprendrez les bases de l'approche anthropologique et ce qu'elle peut vous apporter en termes de réflexion sur votre propre société, sur votre vie et votre quotidienneté. Ce cours vous donne l’opportunité de comparer vos expériences et d’échanger vos points de vue avec des personnes d’autres horizons.
Les six semaines de cours aborderont une série de thématiques illustrées par des exemples concrets de modes d’existence divers et disséminés sur le globe. Des enseignants plongés au cœur des pratiques sociales et des enjeux politiques et économiques les plus variés partageront avec vous leur expérience après des années d'immersion sur les terrains de recherche qui les passionnent.
Si vous êtes curieux de tout et que comprendre votre propre société mais aussi des sociétés méconnues vous intéresse, ce cours s'adresse à vous !
How do human beings organize themselves in societies? What do we call “families” and how do they form? What type of analysis does anthropology propose about parenthood, and symbolic, political and religious systems?
Prospective anthropology helps us to understand and anticipate phenomena that transform our ways of life today. It gives a cross-cutting look at the actions, practices, and words of those people with whom anthropological researchers work.
To understand anthropology is to accept changing your view of the world, and to shift your perpsective of your own habits. If you want to understand the world and its contemporary changes more deeply, follow these researchers in their field, and experiment with other cultural references.
In this course, you will debate with professors and students about family, migrations, virtual worlds, and the world of « invisibles. » You will learn the basis of the anthropological approach and what it can bring you as a reflection tool about your own society and your everyday life. This course gives you the opportunity to compare your experiences and to exchange points of view with people from all around the world.
Professors immersed in the heart of various social practices, political and economic issues will share their experiences with you after years of research in fields that they are passionate about.
If you are curious about everything, and if you are interested in understanding your own society but also unknown societies, this course is for you!Expliquer les clés de l’approche anthropologique et les domaines auxquels elle s’attache

From the study of far distant astrophysical objects over diverse applications in industry, to the ultimate goal of sustainable electricity generation from nuclear fusion.
In the first part of this course, you will learn how nuclear fusion powers our Sun and the stars in the Universe. You will explore the cyclic variation of the Sun’s activity, how plasma flows can generate large-scale magnetic fields, and how these fields can reconnect to release large amounts of energy, manifested for instance by violent eruptions on the Sun.
The second part of this course discusses the key role plasma applications play today in industry and medicine. After a brief survey of the field, you will study in detail how plasmas are generated and sustained in strong electric fields and how this knowledge can be used to avoid undesired occurrence of plasmas in the form of electrical arcs. You will then, in detail, study the transition region between plasma and material surface, called the sheath, and you will learn why its properties are indispensable for the manufacturing of today’s integrated circuits.
Finally, in the third and most extensive part of this course, you will familiarize yourself with the different approaches to fusion energy, the current status, and the necessary steps from present-day experimental devices towards a fusion reactor providing electricity to the grid.
After deriving the general conditions for net energy gain from fusion, we will focus on magnetic confinement fusion. You will learn about the key ingredients of a magnetic fusion reactor, how to confine, heat, and control fusion plasmas at temperatures of 100 million degrees Kelvin, explore the relevant transport mechanisms, and explore the challenges of plasma wall interactions and structural materials.
To enjoy this course on plasma applications, it is recommended to first familiarize yourself with the plasma physics basics taught in Plasma Physics: Introduction.Different applications of plasmas
Understanding of the fusion energy challenge, and acquisition of the basis for developing an overall vision of the different R&amp;D elements

Its behavior is very different from the other states of matter we are usually familiar with. To understand it, a rigorous formalism is required. This is essential not only to explain important astrophysical phenomena, but also to optimize many industrial and medical applications and for achieving fusion energy on Earth.
This physics course, taught by world-renowned experts of the field, gives you the opportunity to acquire a basic knowledge of plasma physics. A rigorous introduction to the plasma state will be followed by a description of the models, from single particle, to kinetic and fluid, which can be applied to study its dynamics. You will learn about the waves that can exist in a plasma and how to mathematically describe them, how a plasma can be controlled by magnetic fields, and how its complex and fascinating behavior is simulated using today’s most powerful supercomputers.
This course is the first of two courses introducing plasma physics and its applications. After completing this course, you will have the prerequisites to enjoy Plasma Physics: Applications, which deals with plasma applications in astrophysics, industry, and nuclear fusion.Basic knowledge of plasma physics and the different models used to describe plasmas

You’ll learn the basics of statistical thinking – starting with an interesting question and some data. Then, we’ll apply the correct statistical tool to help answer our question of interest – using R and hands-on Labs. Finally, we’ll learn how to interpret our findings and develop a meaningful conclusion.
We will cover basic Inferential Statistics – integrating ideas of Part 1. If you have a basic knowledge of Descriptive Statistics, this course is for you. We will learn how to sample data, examine both quantitative and categorical data with statistical techniques such as t-tests, chi-square, ANOVA, and Regression.
Both parts of the course are intended to cover the same material as a typical introductory undergraduate statistics course, with an added twist of modeling. This course is also intentionally devised to be sequential, with each new piece building on the previous topics. Once completed, students should feel comfortable using basic statistical techniques to answer their own questions about their own data, using a widely available statistical software package (R).
This course will consist of:
Instructional videos for statistical concepts broken down into manageable topics
Guided questions to help your understanding of the topic
Weekly tutorial videos for using R
Scaffolded learning with Pre-Labs (using R), followed by Labs where we will answer specific questions using real-world datasets
Weekly wrap-up questions challenging both topic and application knowledge
With these new skills, learners will leave the course with the ability to use basic statistical techniques to answer their own questions about their own data, using a widely available statistical software package (R). Learners from all walks of life can use this course to better understand their data, to make valuable informed decisions.

El modelo de la sociedad industrial está dejando paso a un nuevo modelo de sociedad, aún difuso, en el que la capacidad de transformar la información en conocimiento es clave. Es fácil deducir que para esta nueva sociedad emergente se necesita un concepto de educación bien distinto al que requería la sociedad industrial. Sin este cambio educativo difícilmente se podrá conseguir satisfactoriamente el cambio y, consecuentemente, instalarse adecuadamente en un mundo que va a alterarse radicalmente.
El curso tiene dos objetivos. El primero es presentar el fenómeno de la transformación de la sociedad que estamos viviendo y los fundamentos para definir el mundo que está emergiendo como el de la sociedad del conocimiento.  La pretensión de la primera parte es disponer de un escenario suficientemente detallado y sólido de lo que está sucediendo y superar así la visión e interpretación triviales que pueda haber sobre un nuevo modelo de sociedad. Sin esta buena base es difícil fundamentar el siguiente objetivo del curso: el papel de la educación.
El objetivo de tratar la educación en este curso es para presentarla en estrecha relación con una intensa crisis cultural que inevitablemente tiene que sobrevenir para que no aumente el desajuste entre el mundo tecnológico -planetario, desigual y contradictorio- que hemos levantado y los valores culturales de otros tiempos con los que queremos mirar e interpretar el mundo de hoy y el que se avecina. Así que se tratará la estrecha relación que hay y debe haber entre educación y cultura. De igual modo se verá en el curso la relación entre tecnología y educación, no desde el punto de vista instrumental, sino cultural.
La pretensión del curso es que de esta observación del fenómeno actual de  cambio, y de la interpretación del papel de la educación para la orientación y control de ese cambio, surjan elementos inspiradores de acciones educativas precisas ajustadas a las múltiples realidades concretas desde las que se están sintiendo los desafíos de vivir en el siglo XXI.
El planteamiento didáctico del curso seguirá la estructura de un viaje por el tiempo, por lugares y también por conceptos que haga ameno el recorrido durante las siete semanas.

Delivered by four leading research teams, it will provide you with the economic concepts, measurement approaches and data analytics to make better security and IT decisions, as well as understand the forces that shape the security decisions of other actors in the ecosystem of information goods and services.
Systems often fail because the organizations that defend them do not bear the full costs of failure. In order to solve the problems of growing vulnerability to computer hackers and increasing crime, solutions must coherently allocate responsibilities and liabilities so that the parties in a position to fix problems have an incentive to do so. This requires a technical comprehension of security threats combined with an economic perspective to uncover the strategies employed by cyber hackers, attackers and defenders.
The course covers five main areas:
Introduction to key concepts in security economics. Here, we provide an overview of how information security is shaped by economic mechanisms, such as misaligned incentives, information asymmetry, and externalities.
Measuring cybersecurity. We introduce state of the art security and IT metrics and conceptualize the characteristics of a security metric, its challenges and advantages.
Economics of information security investment. We discuss and apply different economic models that help determine the costs and benefits of security investments in network security.
Security market failures. We discuss market failures that may lead to cybersecurity investment levels that are insufficient from society’s perspective and other forms of unsafe behaviour in cyber space.
Behavioural economics for information security, policy and regulation. We discuss available economic tools to better align the incentives for cybersecurity, including better security metrics, cyber insurance/risk transfer, information sharing, and liability assignment.
After finishing this course, you will be able to apply economic analysis and data analytics to cybersecurity. You will understand the role played by incentives on the adoption and effectiveness of security mechanisms, and on the design of technical, market-based, and regulatory solutions to different security threats.Sound understanding of the economics of cybersecurity as a systems discipline, from security policies (modelling what ought to be protected) to mechanisms (how to implement the protection goals)
How to design security metrics to capture information security issues
How the design of effective policies to enhance and maintain cybersecurity must take into account a complex set of incentives facing not only the providers and users of the Internet and computer software, but also those of potential attackers</description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>222</course_id><title>Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science</title><published_date>2016-08-09T20:14:46-04:00</published_date><course_length>10 weeks</course_length><effort>15 hours per week</effort><subject>Computer Science</subject><price>FREE

In the past decade astronomers have made incredible advances in the discovery of planets outside our solar system. Thirty years ago, we knew only of the planets in our own solar system. Now we know of thousands circling nearby stars.
Meanwhile, biologists have gained a strong understanding of how life evolved on our own planet, all the way back to the earliest cells. We can describe how simple molecules can assemble themselves into the building blocks of life, and how those building blocks might have become the cells that make up our bodies today.
Super-Earths And Life is all about how these two fields together - astronomy and biology - can answer one of our most powerful and primal questions: are we alone in the universe?

The challenge of linking people experiencing addiction to the right response is a serious one, and much depends on understanding addiction and recognising the role that we all play in the pathway to recovery.
This course is intended to help you meet this challenge by increasing your understanding of the biology of addiction and the available treatment options in the different stages of the recovery journey.
Key questions we will look at in this course include:
When do we call “excessive use” addiction?
Why is it so difficult to change addictive behaviour?
Who can play a role to get people on the track to recovery?
How do you respond to people with mild to moderate problems?
How can you assess and increase motivation to change?
What sort of interventions can support a person experiencing severe addiction?
What is my role as a professional, either within or outside of addiction care?
How can I identify the best of the many options available?
What are hurdles to get the right support to manage addiction around the world?
This course explores the “Recovery Pathway,” an easy-to-use framework for helping people with addiction move successfully from addiction to recovery. It helps plan a pathway through screening and assessment, to withdrawal and long-term relapse prevention. The course will examine a range of psychosocial interventions and medication-assisted treatments. You will review the biological basis of behaviour and treatment related to the stage of recovery, as well as evidence-based and service delivery considerations. This course is an ideal starting-point for healthcare professionals who want to get to grips with effective approaches to treating addiction.Framework for pathways to recovery

However, do you know why your food has this price and why it is different from the one that is has in other countries? Well, agricultural public policies are the ones that determine, among other factors, the price you have to pay for your food. In fact, did you know that these policies also impact in food security and climate change?
Do not miss the chance to learn how to analyze agricultural policies in Latin-America and the Caribbean, to learn their implications in food security and to understand their close connection with the environment and climate change. You will learn all this with ‘AGRIMONITOR’: a database created by IDB, that contains information about 18 countries in Latin-America and the Caribbean. AGRIMONITOR will be your ‘right-hand tool’ in the analysis of all these relevant topics.
In addition to the use of AGRIMONITOR, in the course you will find content videos in which Specialists from several organizations (IDB, FAO and OECD) will share their knowledge about the topics covered in the course, readings, IDB cases studies in which we promote public policy’ analysis, suggested readings, practical activities in order to apply the content you have learnt, and discussion forums where you and your classmates will discuss several topics starting with guiding questions.
Furthermore, if you obtain 90 points over 100 in the course, you will have the chance to participate in a competition, which will have two winners. Each winner will work on a research for the IDB Environment, Rural Development and Disaster Risk Management Division, under the conditions stipulated by the Bank!

Important themes to be discussed include the ideal of wu-wei or “effortless action,” the paradox of how one can consciously try not to try, mindfulness techniques and self-cultivation, models of the self and society, rationality versus emotions, trust and human cooperation, and the structure and impact of different spiritual and political ideals.
This period of Chinese history witnessed the formation of all of the major indigenous schools of Chinese thought (Confucianism, Daoism, Mohism and Legalism), which in turn had an impact on the development of East Asian cultural history that is still felt today. We will also explore parallels with Western philosophical and religious traditions, the relevance of early Chinese thought for contemporary debates in ethics, moral education, and political philosophy, and the manner in which early Chinese models of the self anticipate recent developments in the evolutionary and cognitive sciences.
This course provides a full university semester’s worth of material broken into two parts. Each part of the course will last five weeks with a week-long break in between. For each part, there will be four weeks worth of new material. The fifth week will be reserved for review and completion of the final exam.
Part 2 builds upon Part 1 by exploring late Warring States thinkers such as the Confucian Mencius, the Daoist Zhuangzi, and the return to externalism in the form of Xunzi—who believed Mencius betrayed the original Confucian vision—and his former student Hanfeizi, a “Legalist” thinker who helped lay the foundations for the autocratic system that unified the Warring States into China’s first empire. We will conclude with some reflections on what it means to study religious thought, and the thought of other cultures, in a modern, globalized world. Part 2 can be taken as a stand-alone course, but will be more comprehensible and rewarding with the background provided in Part 1.

Though there have been significant changes to the course, this course is not an entirely new edX offering.
People innovate, not organizations. This course is for anybody who wants to understand the innovation process - whether you want to foster innovation within your organization or whether you want to personally innovate.
As practicing innovators, we teach you the fundamentals of how to think like an innovator. Innovation is an iterative process, not a linear one. When innovating, there are thousands of sources of uncertainty in Technology, Implementation, and Markets. We teach you how to cycle through these sources of uncertainty until the right pieces come together in an innovation.
Throughout the course, we build up the innovation process model step by step with real examples and exercises. The goal of this course is to change and refine the way you view the innovation process, providing you with the foundation on which to build your future innovationThe iterative innovation process

However, the mind does not remain in fossil form like bones and teeth. Therefore, to better study and understand our minds their evolutionary origins we need to compare our cognitive features with those of different living primates. This approach is called "Comparative Cognitive Science (CCS)". CCS is a unique combination of Psychology and Primatology. CCS tries to give answers to the fundamental questions such as "what is uniquely human?", "where did it come from?”, "how did we get here?”, and "where do we go?" This intensive course focuses on chimpanzees, the closest relatives of humans.
This course covers selected areas of current research on CCS. We focus on behavioral studies of nonhuman animals, especially chimpanzees. Since the chimpanzee and the human share the latest common ancestor, only about five million years ago, this great ape provides the key to understanding our nature.The latest methodology of Comparative Cognitive Science

But how would this mysterious figure have been understood in Shakespeare’s world?
Harvard professor Stephen Greenblatt (John Cogan University Professor of the Humanities) guides learners through an exploration of the Ghost in Hamlet, considering both its uncanny theatrical power and the historical contexts from which it emerged. Learners will be introduced to the narrative sources of Hamlet, the religious convictions that shaped how people in Renaissance England understood the afterlife, and the ways that Shakespeare’s Ghost would have thrilled and challenged its original audience. Learners will also be invited to share their own theatrical interpretations of Hamlet and to consider how the themes of death, mourning, and memory shape Shakespeare’s play as well as their own lives.Appreciate Shakespearean dramaturgy and language

Companies worldwide invest millions per year on the development of new products and services that will ensure their economic sustainability. However, innovation is a challenging endeavor that requires strategic thinking, customer focus, the right organizational climate, and an effective management approach.
Designers, with their specific skills, can take a major part in driving innovation. This is already successfully happening in companies like SAP, Pepsi-Co and Philips, where design professionals play a leading role in steering innovation. Inspired by these cases, this design course is aimed at designers who would like to take a more active role in the innovative efforts of companies, and who want to go beyond executing new product/service design briefs.
This advanced course is aimed at strategic designers with an interest in acquiring a more senior position in the company or even becoming a Chief Design Officer (CDO). Designers with ambition to better understand and develop their strategic potential, become sparring partners in crafting briefs, and influence strategic decision-making within their organizations will also gain a lot from this course.
By using a three-step approach for leading and managing strategic innovation projects, this course will teach you how to harness your existing design practices – such as envisioning, orchestrating, inspiring, etc. - and transform them into powerful innovation drivers. You will learn how to use these practices to impact strategic decision-making, win stakeholders’ support, and identify relevant KPIs. You will also learn how to adapt your design practices and design-driven way of working to a particular company. Finally, you will practice some design methods to make your impact durable over time.
Through a combination of short lectures, given by design and innovation experts, practical exercises, webinar and individualized feedback, you will learn which design capabilities and practices are most valued by companies, and how to use them effectively for improving a company’s innovation performance. To help you gain a better understanding of innovation, you will:
learn how your strategic contributions can help companies create and capture value through innovation.
gain an in-depth understanding of the organization you are working in.
utilize this understanding to effectively interact with management and other stakeholders.
The lecturers instructing this course are experts in the field of Strategic Value of Design, with experience in teaching this course to Master students at TU Delft, as well as executives through masterclasses at TU Delft. The masterclass on this subject has been highly recommended by design professionals.
By the end of this course, you will know how to effectively communicate your value in a company and how to fulfill leadership positions within your organization. You will also be encouraged to interact with one another and other design professionals.

Or have you started a novel draft only to find your interest or confidence waning? In this course, the international best-selling authors and professors from The University of British Columbia’s renowned MFA program introduce the essential fiction craft toolbox for writers struggling with the common hurdles of first drafts. 
While ideas and inspiration are often enough to ignite interest in writing a novel, writers can quickly lose confidence, especially when their best efforts have inadvertently produced flat characters, waning conflicts, tangled plots and weak dialogue. Reaching your goal of writing (and perhaps, publishing) a novel requires an understanding of fiction’s deeper mechanics and a familiarity with the specific craft elements that will help translate your creativity and imagination into compelling paragraphs, scenes and chapters.
Through writing exercises aimed at developing new skills, concrete examples from published novels, feedback and discussion with fellow writers and opportunities to identify and strengthen weaknesses in their own projects, learners will broaden their knowledge of fiction craft as they explore creating memorable characters, the art of scene design, tactics for managing unwieldy plots and steps for writing layered and meaningful dialogue.
Whether you’re beginning your novel draft or nearing the end, this course is a unique opportunity to learn the essentials of strong fiction writing from award-winning authors sharing their proven methods and approaches.
The course is recommended for professional and aspiring writers, writing groups, those participating in NaNoWriMo, teachers and anyone who has a novel in progress.

This course is designed taking into account the subset and recommendations of the College Board in order to prepare learners for the Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science A exam. The course is divided in three parts of five weeks each.
Part 2 takes over from the first part, and aims to teach how to code good programs in Java, understanding “good” as both correct and efficient. Basic principles of software engineering will be introduced to make it easier for our future self and others to reuse code. Ethical issues and the intellectual property of our programs will also be addressed in the last part of this course. Examples and case studies will be provided, so that learners can implement simple but increasingly complex programs in Java.
Part 3 will deal with fundamental data structures, such as sequences, and algorithms on them, such as searching and sorting.
Emphasis is put on immediate feedback and on having a fun experience. Programming knowledge is not only useful to be able to program today’s devices such as computers and smartphones. It also opens the door to computational thinking, i.e. the application of computing techniques to every-day processes.Detect and correct common programming errors at compile time

Many different analytical methods and techniques are used by researchers and practitioners alike to better design and manage their supply chains. This business and management course introduces the primary methods and tools that you will encounter in your study and practice of supply chains. We focus on the application of these methods, not necessarily the theoretical underpinnings.
We will begin with an overview of introductory probability and decision analysis to ensure that students understand how uncertainty can be modeled. Next, we will move into basic statistics and regression. Finally, we will introduce optimization modeling from unconstrained to linear, non-linear, and mixed integer linear programming.
This is a hands-on course. Students will use spreadsheets extensively to apply these techniques and approaches in case studies drawn from actual supply chains.
This course is part of the MITx MicroMasters Credential in Supply Chain Management that is specifically designed to teach the critical skills needed to be successful in this exciting field. In order to qualify for the MicroMasters Credential you will need to earn a Verified Certificate in each of the five courses as well as pass a Capstone Exam. When you sign up for a Supply Chain Analytics Verified Certificate you will also be granted access to supplemental content such as additional practice problems and complementary videos.

We cover the three main programming paradigms: functional, object-oriented, and declarative dataflow.
The two courses are targeted toward people with a basic knowledge of programming. It will be most useful to beginning programming students, but the unconventional approach should be insightful even to seasoned professionals.
Louv1.1x (Fundamentals) covers functional programming, its techniques and its data structures. You’ll use simple formal semantics for all concepts, and see those concepts illustrated with practical code that runs on the accompanying open-source platform, the Mozart Programming System.
Louv1.2x (Abstraction and Concurrency) covers data abstraction, state, and concurrency. You’ll learn the four ways to do data abstraction and discuss the trade-offs between objects and abstract data types. You’ll be exposed to deterministic dataflow, the most useful paradigm for concurrent programming, and learn how it avoids race conditions.
To learn more about the practical organization of the two courses, watch the introductory video. How to specify problems, break them down into their basic steps, and design algorithms and abstractions to solve them

Both courses provide a solid foundation in the area of reliable distributed computing, including the main concepts, results, models and algorithms in the field.
In order to ensure that IT infrastructures - a key engine of operations for any organization - operate at full capacity and efficiency, it is vital to understand its core: distributed algorithms. To achieve this, the infrastructure itself must be reliable and resilient. This course continues on the foundations of distributed algorithms, introduced in ID2203.1x, and builds on these concepts at a higher level of complexity to develop the skills needed to build and maintain reliable and efficient distributed systems.
ID2203.2x covers specific advanced abstractions and algorithms including sequence consensus and multi-Paxos; atomic broadcast and replicated state machines. It also covers dynamic reconfiguration of services; the use of physical clocks in distributed systems; the CAP theorem, and weaker consistency models, including eventual consistency and conflict-free replicated data-types.

This introductory course seeks to enable you to understand the basic engineering tools used and tradeoffs encountered in the design of these communication systems.  
 
This course is divided into three parts. In Part 1, we examine the point-to-point link, which communicates information from a single transmitter to a single receiver. Part 2 examines how multiple transmitters can share the same physical channel. Part 3 discusses how information can be transmitted reliably from one station to another over a network that connects multiple stations. Online interactive exercises are included to help build your intuition.

This course was inspired by and built upon the course 6.02 Digital Communication Systems developed at MIT, which Prof Bertram Shi worked on during his sabbatical in 2009.Learn how multiple transmitters can share the same physical channel.
Gain a basic understanding of the engineering tools used and tradeoffs faced in designing digital communications systems.

This course is the third of three in a series of mechanics courses from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at MIT. Taken together, these courses provide similar content to the MIT subject 3.032: Mechanical Behavior of Materials.
The 3.032x series provides an introduction to the mechanical behavior of materials, from both the continuum and atomistic points of view. At the continuum level, we learn how forces and displacements translate into stress and strain distributions within the material. At the atomistic level, we learn the mechanisms that control the mechanical properties of materials.  Examples are drawn from metals, ceramics, glasses, polymers, biomaterials, composites and cellular materials.
Part 3 covers viscoelasticity (behavior intermediate to that of an elastic solid and that of a viscous fluid), plasticity (permanent deformation), creep in crystalline materials (time dependent behavior), brittle fracture (rapid crack propagation) and fatigue (failure due to repeated loading of a material).Concepts and problem solving skills relating to viscoelasticity, plasticity, and high temperature creep of crystalline solids

The first two parts cover topics in Descriptive Statistics, whereas the next two focus on Inferential Statistics.
Spreadsheets containing real data from diverse areas such as economics, finance and HR drive much of our discussions.  
In Part 2, we use the language of probability to examine the underlying distributions of random variables. We model real-life phenomena using known variables such as Binomial, Poisson and Normal. We learn how to simulate data that are distributed according to these variables.
We shall take up datasets that have over a million rows, which makes it difficult to analyze using a spreadsheet. This is a natural setting for R, an advanced statistical programming platform. We incorporate helpful tutorials to get learners acquainted with the platform. To use spreadsheets to analyze larger datasets

“If you look back, we've done sooooo much: assembly programming, stack crawling (detective work), building a 32-bit computer, for crying out loud, and also learnt about caches as the cherry on top (which really helped me because I always had trouble understanding how temporary memory worked). And to top it off, they're promising us more exciting courses in the future.” -- Previous StudentThe design of a processor instruction set architecture

(based on Scratch).
Computing has profoundly changed the world, opening up wonderful new ways for people to connect, design, research, play, create, and express themselves. However, just using a computer is only a small part of the picture. The real transformative and empowering experience comes when one learns how to program the computer, to translate ideas into code.
This course teaches students how to do exactly that, using Snap! (based on Scratch), one of the friendliest programming languages ever invented. It's purely graphical, which means programming involves simply dragging blocks around, and building bigger blocks out of smaller blocks. But this course is far more than just learning to program. We focus on seven big ideas (creativity, abstraction, data and information, algorithms, programming, the Internet, and global impact), and six computational thinking practices (connecting computing, creating computational artifacts, abstracting, analyzing problems and artifacts, communicating, and collaborating). Throughout the course, relevance is emphasized: relevance to the student and to society.
Topics include:
Data and Information
Complexity Theory
Recursion, Lambda and Higher Order Functions
Artificial Intelligence
Human Computer Interaction
Lab-based Topics: Algorithms and Data, Trees and Fractals, Recursion and Higher Order Functions

A supply chain is a complex environment with a multitude of forces and variables with various degrees of dependence. Unforeseen events are frequent and in order to achieve a competitive supply chain, constant supervision is needed.
In this business and management course, you will learn methods that are used to master control of supply chains, including how to forecast demand, how to determine the best order quantity for procurement, how to plan capacity and production and much more."
Many of the topics in the course will be illustrated using real companies and real logistics professionals as logistics is not a theoretical subject – it exists all around us – everywhere.
This MOOC is based on a widely popular university course that will give you a working knowledge on supply chain operations that can be applied in your organisation. By the end of this course, you will be able to better control and master your organisation’s system.
Regardless of your industry or organisation type, the concepts and methods from this course will help you become a logistics and supply chain professional. You will never look at a hotel breakfast buffet, a loading bay, a warehouse, a factory, an emergency room or even at a fast food restaurant the same way again…Basic forecasting methods

While we can easily recognize this in our everyday surroundings, an even more diverse world of life can be seen when we look under a microscope. This is the world of microorganisms. Microorganisms are everywhere, and although some are notorious for their roles in human disease, many play important roles in sustaining our global environment. Among the wide variety of microorganisms, here we will explore those that thrive in the most extreme environments, the extremophiles.
In this course, we will discover how diverse life is on our planet and consider the basic principles that govern evolution. We will also learn how we can classify organisms. Following this, we will have a look at several examples of extreme environments, and introduce the microorganisms that thrive under these harsh conditions. We will lay emphasis on the thermophiles, extremophiles that grow at high temperatures and will study how proteins from thermophiles can maintain their structure and function at high temperatures.Basic principles of evolution

However, to actually implement them across a real supply chain requires the use of technology across multiple systems. Supply chains have a long history of using technology to improve efficiency and effectiveness. The shear scale and scope of most supply chains require many distinct systems to interact with each other.
Unfortunately, technology is a moving target. It is constantly evolving and improving so that today’s technology is outdated within a few years or months. Rather than focusing on a specific software system, this business and management course will focus on three aspects: fundamental concepts, core systems, and data analysis.
We will start with the introduction of fundamental concepts that are used in all software tools. We will cover IT fundamentals, including project management and software processes, data modeling, UML, relational databases and SQL. We will also introduce Internet technologies, such as XML, web services, and service-oriented architectures. No prior programming experience required.
We will then provide an overview of the main types of supply chain software including ERP, WMS, and TMS systems. We will describe their main functionality, how they work, how they are used, their architecture, data flows, and how they are organized into modules. We will also cover the software selection process and how software upgrade and implementation projects should be organized and managed.
Finally, we will dive into data analysis that is core to all large supply chains. We will introduce visualization and big data analysis techniques that are used in practice today.
This course is part of the MITx MicroMasters Credential in Supply Chain Management that is specifically designed to teach the critical skills needed to be successful in this exciting field.

Can we know everything? Or are there fundamental limits to how much we can explain? If there are limits, to what extent can we explain the nature of physical reality? RealityX investigates the limits of knowledge and what we can and cannot know of the world and ourselves.
We will trace the evolution of ideas about the nature of reality in philosophy and the natural sciences through the ages. Starting with the philosophers of Ancient Greece and ending with cutting edge theories about the universe, quantum physics, and the nature of consciousness.
Learners who complete this course will be able to:
A. Communicate with others about the latest scientific discoveries in various disciplines including cosmology, quantum physics, mathematics, machine intelligence and cognitive science.
B. Identify key points in history where scientific advances changed humanity’s philosophy and understanding of the nature of reality and our place in the Universe.
C. Reflect on and examine their own worldview and identify if any changes occurred during this course.
D. Confidently argue about scientific evidence, philosophical viewpoints, and others’ interpretations of both.
E. Demonstrate how the scientific method works, its limitations, and how scientists use it to construct knowledge about physical reality.
Join world-renowned physicist and author Marcelo Gleiser and leading experts as we explore how philosophers and physicists from Plato to Einstein and many others have attempted to explain the nature of the world and of reality.
This course is a project of the Institute for Cross-Disciplinary Engagement at Dartmouth (ICE), dedicated to transforming the dialogue between the sciences and the humanities in academia and in the public sphere in order to explore fundamental questions where a cross-disciplinary exchange is essential. </description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>286</course_id><title>Anatomy: Human Neuroanatomy</title><published_date>2016-08-23T16:09:42-04:00</published_date><course_length>8 weeks</course_length><effort>3-4 hours per week</effort><subject>Biology &amp; Life Sciences</subject><price>FREE

Quel lien existe-t-il entre l’exploitation des ressources naturelles (terre, eau, ressources minières, forêts, ...) et le développement durable ? Ce cours vous permettra de comprendre les opportunités mais aussi les défis que la présence de ressources naturelles offre, tant au niveau local que global. En analysant les effets socio-économiques et écologiques de la ruée actuelle vers ces ressources naturelles, vous comprendrez mieux les liens entre crise agraire, crise alimentaire et crise environnementale. A partir d’études de cas spécifiques, c’est votre regard sur les dynamiques globales contemporaines qui en sera modifié.

A la fin du cours, par rapport à des problématiques liées à la gestion des ressources naturelles (ruée sur la terre, le sous-sol, l’eau et/ou la forêt), vous serez capables de:
comprendre, comparer et analyser des modèles théoriques qui permettent de décoder de telles problématiques
décomposer ces problématiques en causes, conséquences, solutions et points de vue divergents sur ces trois elements
repérer, dans votre environnement, des cas d'étude qui illustrent ces problématiques et leur appliquer le processus de décomposition vu dans le cours.
Vous serez invités à choisir deux ressources naturelles parmi les quatre proposées. Vous développerez les apprentissages annoncés au travers de présentations vidéo par la professeur et par des experts, de QCM, d’un jeu de plateau à jouer avec vos proches (Land Rush), de débats et de cas d’étude proposés par vous, que vous schématiserez et présenterez aux autres via une activité d’évaluation par les pairs.

Economic outcomes are the result of our complex interactions with other people, businesses, the government, as well as with people and businesses globally. In this economics course, you will learn the basic stylized framework that economists use to think about, account for, measure and explain these complex interactions and outcomes.
In the first half of the course, we consider how households decide how much to work and how to spend and save money. We will also look at how businesses make economic decisions such as how many workers to hire and how many machines and buildings to use to produce their products.
In the second half of the course, we consider how different policies can potentially enhance or distort market outcomes by offsetting, alleviating, or amplifying these inefficiencies. Our focus will be on five aspects of economic policy:
labor market policies and unemployment
R&amp;D and innovation policies
fiscal policies and taxation
monetary policy and inflation 
free-trade policies
This course satisfies the Social-Behavioral Sciences (SB) general studies requirement at Arizona State University. This course may satisfy a general education requirement at other institutions; however, it is strongly encouraged that you consult with your institution of choice to determine how these credits will be applied to their degree requirements prior to transferring the credit.Basic principles of the theory of household and business decisions
How these decisions drive macroeconomic outcomes, namely growth and fluctuations

What is the religious and political context into which they emerged? How were they first interpreted? How and why do they make such an enormous impact in Christian communities and in politics today?
Archaeological materials and ancient writings will help you to enter the ancient Mediterranean world and to think about religious groups, power, poverty, health, and the lives of elites and slaves in the Roman Empire. We’ll explore how immediately controversial these letters were, and how these letters are used today to debate relations between Christians and Jews; issues such as love, law, and grace; and topics such as charismatic Christianity, homosexuality, and women’s religious leadership.
 
Whether you’ve been studying Paul’s letters for years or are merely curious about what Christian scriptures are, this course will provide you with information to deepen your understanding of the ancient contexts and present-day controversies about these texts.

You may have heard of actuarial science, or you might even know an actuary, but do you know what an actuary does? During the course you’ll hear from a wide variety of actuaries about their careers.
And don’t be scared that the course will be “just a whole lot of mathematics”. Together, we will go beyond the math to learn how actuaries approach problems relating to risk, using examples from:
Finance
Investments
Banking
Insurance
You will learn how actuarial science applies mathematical and statistical methods to assess risk in these industries and other professions.
You’ll experience “hands-on” learning using Excel (or an equivalent spreadsheet tool) to project and investigate the financial condition of a company choosing appropriate strategies for the company through the use of simulations.
The course has been carefully designed for students from a wide variety of backgrounds, with secondary/high school level being the only assumption of mathematical background. Even if you don’t have any background in, for example, calculus, the course has been designed so you can skip over these sections without affecting your understanding of the rest of the course. You also do not need to have any Excel or other spreadsheet background to take the course.
For those with stronger mathematical backgrounds, extension questions are provided to test you further. You’ll learn a huge amount about actuarial science no matter what your background is!

FAQ
Is Financial Aid Available?
We are pursuing options to make financial aid available, but at this time it is not available to GFA students.
Can I receive university credit for courses via GFA even if I have not received my high school diploma or passed the high school equivalency exam?
Anyone can take these courses for ASU credit. However, if you’d like to apply them toward a university degree, you will most likely need your high school diploma or proof that you’ve passed the high school equivalency exam. This will also depend on the policies of the particular university to which you are applying.
Is GFA for Freshman only?
No. While GFA is perfect for incoming Freshman who want to enjoy a flexible, economically-viable model for taking Freshman-level courses, ambitious high school students who want a jump-start for their college career, or adult-learners returning to Freshman year after a hiatus, these introductory-level courses can be taken by anyone who wants to continue lifelong learning or by educators who want to share resources with students.
Will GFA be extended to full college degrees?
At this time, edX and ASU are focused on breaking down the barriers to successfully completing Freshman year.
Will I get a letter grade on my Verified Certificate? 
No. Your Verified Certificate is provided by edX to any student who completes an ID Verified course with a passing score (which varies, but will be clearly communicated via course materials) and will not feature a letter grade. Additionally, your Verified Certificate does not equal credit earned by ASU and you will still need to complete the steps required for credit conversion after you have earned the Verified Certificate.
Will I get a letter grade on my Arizona State University transcript?
Yes students who pursue the ID Verified track will receive a letter grade from ASU for the course and an official Arizona State University transcript if they pay the credit fee.
Why is the estimated effort (18 hours per week) for these courses so high? 
As a tier-1 public research university, ASU courses reflect the rigorous standards faculty members expect of their students. Given this, ASU recommends that for a 7.5 week course, students should be prepared to spend 6 hours a week on coursework for every 1 course credit. So for a 3 credit course, you should expect to spend approximately 18 hours of coursework per week.
To what extent can I use credits earned via GFA to apply for a university degree?
Arizona State University is an accredited university. Credits you earn via Global Freshman Academy will appear on an Arizona State University transcript and can be used as transfer credits anywhere ASU credits are accepted. We recommend that you check with your university to see whether ASU credits are accepted. While having earned ASU credits before you apply to a university will not guarantee your admittance, we believe many universities will value the hard work you have already completed.
Will Arizona State University credits be accepted at international universities?
University credits are typically recognized globally when they come from accredited institutions. Please check with your local university to see Arizona State University credits are accepted.
After having taken a class and passed, what is the maximum allotted time to pay for the credit through ASU?
You will be able to upgrade from a standard Verified Certificate to credit for one year after you successfully complete and pass the course.
How will exam proctoring work?
Students who have chosen the Verified track in the course will be asked to re-verify their ID upon launching any proctored exam in a GFA course. During a proctored exam, students will be monitored for the duration of the exam, and suspect behavior will be flagged and reviewed within 3-5 days of exam submission. A webcam will be required for proctored exams.
Will GFA courses be offering any accommodations for people with learning disabilities? Especially during proctored exams?
edX is committed to achieving full accessibility (WCAG 2.0 compliant or better) in the platform. We are continuously making accessibility improvements as we build out new capabilities and programs in order to meet this stringent standard. In terms of our proctoring solution, we are working with the software vendor and our university partners to ensure anyone taking courses for credit eligibility has an equitable experience. Accessibility is a key requirement for Arizona State University, as well. All Global Freshman Academy courses delivered through the edX platform will be ADA compliant and transcripts for hearing impaired students will be available for each video.
What is the full list of courses offered via Global Freshman Academy?
To see the most up-to-date list of courses offered by Global Freshman Academy, visit the Future GFA Courses section of the Welcome to Global Freshman Academy Course.
If I fail a class in GFA, will it be reflected on my transcript? 
If you do not pass the course, you will not be eligible for the upgrade to credit. The failure will not appear anywhere on your ASU transcript.
If I fail a GFA course, will I have the option to retake it at no additional cost? 
With the Global Freshman Academy, you only pay for the course credit once you receive a passing grade. If you need to retake a course, you can do so at anytime but will be required to again pay the $45 ID Verification fee.
If I already know the material of a course offered via GFA, would I have the option to test-out and receive ASU credit? 
At this time, we do not offer an option to test out of the material offered in a GFA course. You will need to complete and pass all course material in order to be eligible for credit.
Will you have courses in other subject areas? e.g., Education, Management, Psychics, Computer Science, etc.
The Global Freshman Academy is a collection of freshman level courses that fulfill a specific set of general education requirements. The general studies focus areas will include Mathematical Studies, English, Humanities, Arts and Design, Social-Behavioral Sciences and Natural Sciences. To see the most up-to-date list of courses offered by Global Freshman Academy, visit the Future GFA Courses section of the Welcome to Global Freshman Academy Course.
How do I transfer the credits that I might earn through GFA?
Once you complete your course(s) and are ready to transfer the credit earned, you will simply request your official transcript from ASU and submit to the the university to which you are applying.
I have previously earned credits from other universities. Can I still take courses through GFA?
We would first recommend checking with the university of your choice, whether that is ASU or elsewhere, to see which of the credits you already have would transfer in and what freshman year classes you may still need to take. This will give you a better idea of what GFA courses you would find beneficial.What Global Freshman Academy (GFA) is

Or learn to understand the world through data analysis? Start by learning R Statistics!
Skilled professionals who can process and analyze data are in great demand today. In this course you will explore concepts in statistics to make sense out of data. You will learn the practical skills necessary to find, import, analyze and visualize data. We will take a look under the hood of statistics and equip you with broad tools for understanding statistical inference and statistical methods. You will also perform some really complicated calculations and visualizations, following in the footsteps of Karolinska Institute’s researchers.
Statistical programming is an essential skill in our golden age of data abundance. Health science has become a field of big data, just like so many other fields of study. New techniques make it possible and affordable to generate massive data sets in biology. Researchers and clinicians can measure the activity for each of 30000 genes of a patient. They can read the complete genome sequence of a patient. Thanks to another trend of the decade, open access publishing, the results of such large scale health science are very often published for you to read free of charge. You can even access the raw data from open databases such as the gene expression database of the NCBI, National Center for Biotechnology Information.
We will dive into this data together. Learn how to use R, a powerful open source statistical programming language, and see why it has become the tool of choice in many industries in this introductory R statistics course. How to use R to perform basic statistical analyses

Students can expect to cover the material of a traditional first circuits course with a project-based approach. We start with essential theory and develop an understanding of the building blocks of electronics as we analyze, design, and build different parts of a robot from scratch around a microcontroller. This course uses the Texas Instruments MSP430G2 LaunchPad, but you are welcome to bring whichever development board or microcontroller you like!
Useful mathematics will be discussed where appropriate, but only a working knowledge of high school algebra is required to follow along for most of the course. The philosophy of the course is to learn by doing, so every lecture features a substantial lab component. Students are invited to work together in small groups to build their own robots along with the instructors. There will also be individual circuit analysis and design exercises to reinforce the theories presented in the course. Those who successfully complete each theory assignment and earn a passing grade will get an Honor Code certificate from BerkeleyX.
Additionally, a kit of electronic components will be available from Newark element14 starting June 12. The kit is not necessary to obtain a certificate for this run of the course, but it will greatly enhance your learning experience. Some mechanical components are required to complete the robot as presented in the course. Also, the lab experience will be most effective if you have access to a digital multimeter.
Creativity is encouraged! Students who are willing to work outside the bounds of the class to develop their own inventions will get the most out of this guided learning experience.
MyDAQ Information
Those who do not have access to an oscilloscope or a digital multimeter might consider purchasing a MyDAQ to enable measurements. The video modules use the MyDAQ and the MyProtoBoard as measurement equipment to debug circuits. National Instruments has made available the MyDAQ for students in this course. If you are interested, take a look at the MyDAQ ordering page: http://www.studica.com/us/en/BerkeleyMOOC.html

Parts Kit Information
The parts included in the construction of the robot can be purchased at Newark's landing page, which can be found here: http://www.element14.com/community/community/learning-center/online-learning/moocs/edxucb-bridging

A detailed bill of materials with more information can be found here: courses.edx.org/asset-v1:BerkeleyX+EE40LX+2T2015+type@asset+block@EE40LX_PartsList_Summer15.pdf
What is the format of the class?
The class consists of eight modules. Every module consists of a combination of theory-based lectures and lab-based discussions where we apply that module’s theory to building a part of a robot. Quiz exercises are sprinkled throughout the videos to reinforce your knowledge and every module ends with a problem set that reinforces the design and analysis aspects of the class.
Is this class taught at UC Berkeley?
This class is part of the laboratory component of "EE40: Introduction to Microelectronic Systems," the first circuit analysis course at UC Berkeley. It was specifically designed for the online course format.
What will the robot do?
The bare-bones robot that we build will be capable of bouncing around, responding to light or touch inputs, and responding to a loud audio signal.
What supplies and equipment will I need to get the most out of this course?
In order to download programs to the MSP430 microcontroller, you will need access to a modern operating system (Apple, Windows, or Linux) with the Energia environment (http://energia.nu/download) installed. Additionally, access to some wire cutters and pliers would be useful. Also, the lab experience will be most effective if you have access to a digital multimeter. An oscilloscope would be useful, but not necessary.
The NI MyDAQ has been made available for students who would like to follow along with the course. The robot project as presented also requires a few wooden craft sticks and two springs which can be found at a local hardware store.
How much does the kit cost?
The parts kit will cost around $50 USD for most parts. You are welcome to purchase a kit with another student and to work together on labs to split costs. We will also demonstrate other parts not in the kit for those interested in extending their projects.
Will I need to know how to program?
Sample programs are provided in each module that will allow you to test your own circuits with an MSP430 LaunchPad controller. These programs will be explained in optional videos for interested students. If you already know how to code, you can tweak these programs to add additional functionality to your project.
Will this course cover microcontroller programming?
No. Sample programs written in Energia, a high-level language, will be provided, but programming will not be explicitly covered. Students interested in learning microcontroller programming should refer to UT Austinx’s Embedded Systems course.
What if I already have a microcontroller?
Since analog electronics are the emphasis of the course, you should feel free to use any microcontroller you feel comfortable with. However, the use of any other microcontrollers would require you to write your own programs.
Is there a required textbook?
No textbook is required for this course. Handouts are provided for the concepts presented in the class; material for some of these handouts is taken from the 2nd edition of the book Circuits by Fawwaz Ulaby and Michel Maharbiz and we recommend the book as way to delve deeper into basic circuit concepts. We also occasionally provide links to web content that we find useful or informative.Fundamentals for engineering electronic interfaces between the physical world and digital devices

The concept of blended learning provides a framework to help educators integrate online educational technologies into face-to-face classes purposefully. When done effectively, blended learning has been shown to enhance student engagement and improve students’ learning outcomes.
In this self-paced course, we introduce you to principles and practices of blended learning. We cover the benefits and challenges of creating blended learning experiences, discuss how to design and deliver a successful blended course, and provide specific strategies and examples for using edX content in your classroom. This course is rich with case examples of institutions who have adopted blended learning, with stories shared from faculty around the world. The course also references research on blended learning models, and its impact.How to understand the challenges and benefits of blended learning

Are you curious about how the mass-produced modern book emerged in the first place?  Come behind the scenes in Harvard’s libraries to explore the look, feel and even smell of nineteenth-century British and American books in this module of The Book: Histories Across Time and Space.
In 19th-century Britain and America, schooling expanded, paper cheapened, and new technologies allowed print to reach wider audiences than ever before.  After the rare and beautiful manuscripts and books showcased by earlier modules, the mass-produced, disposable objects that survive from the nineteenth century bear witness to the rise of the reading public.
This module investigates what scholars know about nineteenth-century reading, as well as how they know it.
This module’s six sections guide you through underlined, inscribed, defaced and repaired books in Harvard’s collections:
1. Name That Book
Find out what you can tell about a book when you’re blindfolded.
2. Handheld Books and Mobile Readers
What book did one soldier carry to Civil War battlefields in his pocket? (Hint: it’s not what you think.)
3. The Pen and the Needle
Did 19th-century girls have to choose between sewing and reading?  The holes pricked in one book suggest they did both at once.
4. Leaving your Mark
Luckily for future historians, these children didn’t listen when people told them not to write in their books.
5. Detective Work
Try out some tools that build on what you’ve learned about books at Harvard to discover the stories hidden in your local library.
6. Over to You

Medieval liturgy, however, took up many hours of every day, filled the city's largest meeting halls, and even spilled onto the streets. At the center of the medieval liturgy were the books we will study in this course.
In this module of The Book: Histories Across Time and Space, we’ll explore and explain the beautiful service books of the medieval church. No prior knowledge of liturgy or Latin is required, but there will be a lot of both, along with music.
The medieval services consisted of a complex system of cycles, and the liturgical books correspond to the various functions of the people who used them: Laypersons, nuns and monks, readers, singers, priests, and bishops.
We will explore and examine these precious objects using materials from Harvard’s collections. Close examination of various types of books will help to explain the complex and collaborative nature of medieval worship. Ultimately, we will learn how these beautifully adorned books  represent the importance of liturgy as an essential function of society in the Middle Ages.

However, we should also consider what is lost as texts transition to a digital sphere.
This module of The Book: Histories Across Time and Space seeks to re-introduce learners to the codex – a handwritten and hand-constructed book - as a three-dimensional object whose characteristics produce meaning in the experience of the reader.
This module is designed to walk you through the process of making a medieval manuscript. Using a wide variety of examples from the collections of Harvard’s Houghton Library, it will familiarize you with basic terms and concepts and give you a “feel” for the shapes, sizes, formats, materials and considerations of craft that went into the making of the book as we know it.
Throughout the Middle Ages there existed an intimate relationship between making and meaning. Codices were tactile as well as visual objects designed to engage multiple senses. In the illuminated manuscript, it is often impossible to distinguish neatly between text and image; rather, letters assume imagistic forms and images take the form of letters.
Bookmakers were sensitive to the interplay of materials, from the parchment of the pages to the wooden boards, designed to protect the contents. Each of these elements conditioned a reader’s interaction with the book. Bookmaking required a significant material investment. The production process was laborious and lengthy, involving many separate stages and craftsmen.
Books participated in a wide range of ritual, liturgical, devotional, educational and practical contexts, each of which in turn conditioned the presentation and reception of both their form and content.

However, only a tiny percentage of these texts have been edited and published. To gain access to the rest, you need to learn the art and science of reading medieval handwriting,
This module of The Book: Histories Across Time and Space introduces students to the world of medieval paleography, the science of reading old handwriting. This particular module focuses on notarial handwriting from the city of Marseille in the 14th and 15th centuries. The module features household inventories, which identify some of the fascinating objects found in people’s houses. Assessments and quizzes will allow you to track your progress as you move from letter-group to letter-group. In addition to learning the handwriting, we will take special care to explore some of the many abbreviations and other elements of the secular registers of the later Middle Ages.
Some knowledge of Latin or another Romance Language will be very helpful for understanding the texts you will read, but students without these language skills will still enjoy this chance to explore medieval handiwork.

But the technology takes more than one form and originated in more than one historical context.
In this module of The Book: Histories Across Space and Time, you will learn how early printed books in mid-fifteenth century Europe were first modeled on medieval manuscripts, but soon developed new conventions that remain familiar to us today. This module also explores printing in East Asia, by wood block and movable type, and the late dominance of manuscript production in the Islamic world. 
In the first units of this module we compare and contrast manuscripts and printed books produced mainly in Europe from 1470-1700, looking at continuities and differences in layout, format, and the methods, materials, and economics of production. We also discuss examples of illustrated books and of handwritten annotations in books, including marginal annotations by readers and the marks of censors.
Two shorter units in this module focus on printing in East Asia, especially China, to highlight the features of woodblock printing which was common there, and on the Middle East, especially the Ottoman context, where a vibrant manuscript culture remained dominant until 1800. Taken together, this module gives an overview of three different contexts and technologies of book production before 1800.
Each unit features rare manuscripts and printed books in the Harvard Libraries, which viewers can investigate in more depth within the courseware and on their own.

The codex, with its portability and instant access to any place in the text, became the dominant container for writing after the 4th century BCE, but scrolls continued to be made. Why and how did the scroll format remain popular and relevant in the age of the codex? This course proposes four main reasons, which 
account for essentially every kind of scroll that still exists today. We will see and examine in detail a number of beautiful objects, and come to understand the thinking of those who chose the scroll format for their texts.
This module features four main units, each of which is based on one of the reasons for scroll-making:
Scrolls of indeterminate length
Scrolls in long format
Ceremonial and archaizing scrolls
Portable scrolls
Scrolls in the Age of the Book also features a guided tour of an exhibition on Harvard University’s collection of medieval scrolls, held at Houghton Library, Harvard’s special collections library, in Spring 2014. Each scroll featured in the exhibit has been fully digitized by Harvard’s Preservation Services division, and participants will have the opportunity to interact with them in unprecedented fashion using Mirador, a state-of-the-art web application developed by Harvard and Stanford Universities.

We will focus on the importance of books as physical objects and the raw material of literature--namely, paper.  By considering the nature of paper and how it was made during the early modern period--from Gutenberg's time to the early nineteenth century--we can begin to understand the character of books and the way they worked.
This module also examines how books fit into the legal and political system of France under the Old Regime during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when the French set standards imitated throughout Europe.  Before modern copyright, legal books had privileges, granted by the king, which provided a guarantee of quality as well as certification of   orthodoxy.  To qualify for a privilege, books had to be approved by censors.  Uncensored books, including most of the works of the Enlightenment, were usually produced outside France and circulated in the kingdom through a vast underground distribution system. 
In addition, this module addresses the emergence of literature as a modern form of culture, which can be studied best in eighteenth-century England.  The first copyright law (1710), a high rate of literacy, a booming consumer market, a precocious periodical industry, and entrepreneurial publishing concentrated in London led to the development of a new kind of author--the independent writer. Samuel Johnson epitomized this new phenomenon. This module will allow you to get a close look at him and everything he represented by providing access to the Hyde Collection of Johnson's books and papers in Houghton Library at Harvard.

Although its contents were of monastic origin, literate lay readers were the most likely to use books of hours, as served not only as a prayer book, but also as a way of keeping track of the calendar, often doubling as a family chronicle.
Books of hours provide insight into broad patterns of piety marking the High and later Middle Ages, and through their choice of texts, images and added materials, inform us about the interior life and aspirations of everyone from kings and queens and lords and ladies to monks and nuns and, ordinary members of the patrician class, merchants and others.
In this course, we will explore how books of hours provide the closest thing we have to a comprehensive and continuous record of the development of painting across most of western Europe from the later thirteenth through the early sixteenth century.
“The Book of Hours” is one module of a series of courses called “The Book: Histories Across Time and Space.” You may take this course on its own, or with the other courses of the series.

Exploring that question, we identify the personalities and historical forces—the progressives, racial desegregation, legalization and collective bargaining—that shaped and re-shaped U.S. school politics and policy. We visit the places where new ideas and practices were spawned, and we look at some of their unanticipated consequences.
In the three subsequent mini-courses, we seek answers to a second question: What are the best ways of lifting the performance of American schools to a higher level? To explore these questions, we look at ideas and proposals of those who want to save our schools—be it by reforming the teaching profession, holding schools accountable, or giving families more school choices. In interviews with reform proponents and independent experts, we capture the intensity of the current debate. In the end, we do not find any silver bullets that can magically lift schools to a new level of performance, but we do pinpoint the pluses and minuses of many new approaches. These three subsequent mini-courses will launch later in the fall and continue into 2016.
Each mini-course contains five to eight lectures, with each lecture containing approximately three videos. The mini-courses also include assigned readings, discussion forums, and assessment opportunities.

The teacher is the most important person in our schools. How do we recruit and retain the very best teachers? What are our current methods for recruiting teachers? How well do we compensate them?  What are the effects of adjusting teacher salaries to be based on their performance in the classroom? When should teachers be given tenure? Do current policies encourage or discourage effective teachers from entering the profession?
Many questions come down to budgetary constraints. Should you hire more teachers so you have smaller classes? Should it be a priority to balance how much is spent between wealthy and poor districts?
Throughout this mini-course, we will be focused on using empirical evidence to answer these questions.
This mini-course contains six lectures, with most lectures divided into three videos. The mini-courses also include assigned readings, discussion forums, and assessments.

Who is accountable for student outcomes? Should we blame the schools or hold the students themselves accountable? Who determines the standards for accountability – the federal government or the individual states?
The demand for accountability in U.S. education resulted in No Child Left Behind and has shaped the Common Core debate. Throughout this mini-course, we will trace the origins of the accountability movement, the increased role of the federal government, the design of accountability interventions, and the impact of accountability programs on student performance.

There has been a rapid expansion of school choice in U.S. education. Charter schools now serve over five percent of the public school population, voucher programs have been introduced in many states, and digital education has captured the attention of educators across the country. What is the theoretical basis for these innovations? How effective are the early initiatives? How do parents decide what is best for their children? And how do all of these options affect the students who remain in traditional public schools?
With the help of several scholars and participants in these new ventures, we will discuss the ways in which these school choice initiatives are re-shaping U. S. education.

Handel’s Messiah premiered in Dublin on April 13, 1742, and remains popular to this day. Harvard’s Thomas Forrest Kelly (Morton B. Knafel Professor of Music) guides learners through Messiah’s musical highlights, while detailing Handel’s composition process, the preparations and rehearsals, and the premiere performance.
Learners in this module of First Nights need not have any prior musical experience. In this unit, you will learn the basics of musical form and analysis, the genres and styles used in Messiah, the circumstances of its first performance, and its subsequent history.

The monumental symphony’s size and complexity stretches traditional instrumental forms to the breaking point, and its famous choral finale changed our view of orchestral music forever.
Harvard’s Thomas Forrest Kelly (Morton B. Knafel Professor of Music) guides learners through all four movements of Beethoven’s 9th Symphony, highlighting aspects of symphonic form, describing Beethoven’s composition process, the rehearsals and premiere performance, and the work’s continued relevance today.
You will learn the basics of musical form and analysis, the genres and styles used and the circumstances of this symphony’s first performance and subsequent history. Learners in this course need not have any prior musical experience.

Achieving this requires a deep understanding of current social problems and how policy is formulated, alongside the ability to tell that story in a manner that drives an otherwise apathetic public into action.
The goal of this online course is two-fold: 1) to teach people from all walks of life how to use journalism and media as an implement of social change; and 2) have those students become effective change agents themselves. This class is not theoretical – students should be prepared to dig in deep and make meaningful contributions to policy change on a global level.
This course equips students with the knowledge and skills they need to produce solution-based journalism – stories that give equal weight to problems and solutions. Throughout the course, students will view examples of outstanding solution-based journalism. The majority of these stories focus on vulnerable children. The umbrella of children allows us to explore the broad, but deeply interwoven policy areas concerning: communities, poverty, child protection, child maltreatment prevention, foster care, and the courts.
At the same time, this course provides students with a platform to research, report on, and write about the policy and justice issues that fuel their own interests and passions, whether that involves immigration crises or poverty. Early on, students will share their interest areas with their classmates and start to share information and ideas. Students will then produce Final Stories on their topics of interest.
Student work will be published throughout the semester and have a direct, immediate impact. Through precise, rigorous reporting and policy analysis, students will substantively contribute to public discourse, and by virtue of that contribution drive political will toward positive policy solutions to the myriad social issues that vulnerable peoples across this globe face.
With that experience, students will be better prepared to use journalism and media for social change in whatever field they explore beyond the class.Ways to use journalism and media as an implement of social change

American Icons – from the Star Spangled Banner to the Statue of Liberty – how have these become iconic symbols for Americans?  What do these icons represent in a global context?
Rights and Liberties – from the Declaration of Independence to the Greensboro Lunch Counter, how have Americans defined, and continue to define, their rights and governance?
America the Beautiful – From evidence of the continent’s first inhabitants to the conservation efforts of the Smithsonian’s scientists, how have the American people – both native and settler – envisioned, explored, worked and protected the land and its resources?
Spirit of Invention – from the Model T to the space program, how have America’s pioneering inventions changed the world?
In this course you will gain a unique perspective on American history and culture by learning the stories behind objects that were, and continue to be, an essential part of U.S. history. Most importantly, you will reflect on what objects have personal meaning to you, and the role that symbolic objects play in your own histories.
This course is adapted from the video lecture series produced by Smithsonian and The Great Courses, Experiencing America: A Smithsonian Tour Through History.You will learn why specific objects, from our nation’s distant past to its near present, are essential parts of U.S. History and critical elements of the Smithsonian's collection
You will discover the unusual and surprising stories behind these objects
You will identify themes in American history that unite these objects across time up to the present day
You will create your own original exhibit that applies the core themes of the course, from Rights and Liberties to the Spirit of Innovation, to the objects of today’s world

The key is showing a potential employer what you can offer BEYOND your credentials.
This is not a standard business course on writing job applications and practicing interview techniques.
We’ve thought deeply about what actually matters to employers and how you can develop the skills and qualities they value.
This course will show you how to take your experiences, extract what you’ve learned from them and present them in a way that would be attractive to an employer. 
We’ll help you develop your employability, which is the set of achievements, skills, and personal attributes that make you attractive to an employer, so that you can successfully navigate the recruitment process and be effective in your job.
You’ll hear from:
Employers discussing what they value when hiring new graduates
Current students who have maximized their university experience
Graduates who have transitioned successfully into the workplace
We’ll also share our knowledge and the perspectives of other experts in this area.Understand what employability is and why it is important.
Recognise opportunities for employability development.
Apply self-reflective methods to interpret your experiences and connect them to your employability.
Develop your communication skills to convey your potential to employers in the recruitment context.
Convey your unique qualities and skills to potential employers in various employment contexts.
Define professionalism and understand how to conduct yourself appropriately in the work environment.
Prepare for the transition from university to your first job.
Determine how to develop your employability throughout your career and understand the benefits of lifelong learning.

In this course on Behavioral Medicine, you will learn about basic behavioral medicine concepts and explore how they can be applied to help people who need to change specific lifestyle behaviors to attain better health. Working with virtual patient interactions will give you a chance to test behavioral medicine interventions. You will also learn self¬-help tools based on behavioral medicine, for whatever you need to change in your own life.
To help people who need to improve their health by changing their behaviors, we will learn about Motivational Interviewing (MI), a counseling style that stimulates behavior change. You will have an opportunity to test basic techniques in MI with a “virtual bartender” who has sleep problems that he is trying to solve by drinking alcohol. The following sections will focus on coping with stress, improving sleep, increasing physical activity and everyday behaviors like hand washing, safer sex and minimizing risky alcohol use.
To complete this course, you will need to spend a total of about 30-40 hours. This time covers course videos, follow-up questions to help you remember what you have learned, course reading (mostly open access scientific articles) and homework tasks. Part of the work is for you to do on your own, and part will be together with other participants in the course community.To understand how unhealthy behaviors are maintained and how to change them for better health.
To use behavioral medicine concepts to better interpret what you see in your own individual and societal health contexts.
To describe and apply interventions for healthy behavior changes, including treating stress and sleep problems, increasing physical activity, and reducing behaviors that contribute to the risk of infection.</description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>373</course_id><title>Circular Economy: An Introduction</title><published_date>2016-01-11T17:19:41-05:00</published_date><course_length>7 weeks</course_length><effort>3 - 6 hours/week</effort><subject>Design</subject><price>FREE

We all know about the challenges we’re facing: waste, climate change, resource scarcity, loss of biodiversity. At the same time, we want to sustain our economies and offer opportunities for a growing world population. This course is about providing solutions we really believe in: a Circular Economy.
In this course we explore the Circular Economy: how businesses can create value by reusing and recycling products, how designers can come up with amazingly clever solutions, and how you can contribute to make the Circular Economy happen. 
You will learn to re-think the economic system you’re experiencing every day, and act upon it. Be a leader in this major paradigm shift! Shape a more circular future together with our global network.

The practical applications of this principle are quite profound, and already within the last eight years they have lead to prediction and discovery of a vast range of new materials with exotic properties that were considered to be impossible before.

FAQs
Are there any books that are required for the course?
No, the course will only rely on materials and software freely available online.
Is it possible to get credit for this course at my university?
Not by default, but we invite anyone to use the course materials as a basis for a graduate course, with course materials studied as preparation and followed by a classroom discussion. Such courses are planned at universities of Copenhagen, Delft, Leiden, and University of Maryland. Following such a course will obviously give you credit points.
Would it not be better to take a more formal approach, and to describe the math in a more rigorous and systematic way?
While advanced math is certainly relevant for some researchers, in our experience it is the simple things that are the most confusing. We aim for the course to stay accessible and relevant to advanced undergraduate/beginner graduate students, both the theorists and experimentalists.
I do not know enough about condensed matter physics, but I have attended an exciting talk/read a cool article, and I'd like to learn more. Would the course be useful for me?
We are not sure. On the one hand, we will aim the course at people familiar with basic condensed matter physics and the necessary math, hence we will always assume that we don't need to explain e.g. band structures from scratch. However, a good share of the course materials are just discussions which would give you some sort of overview and understanding what this is all about.
Why didn't you discuss my favorite topic, which is certainly relevant and exciting?
Hey, that's a great idea! We aim to start from covering the basic questions, and then let the course evolve together with the field. So if you want, please help us by preparing the materials that would be helpful for the course, and they will become a bonus topic. By the way, same holds if you spot an error, or know how to improve the course: everything about this course is open, so don't hesitate to contribute.

How would you disprove the stance that man-made global warming is just an “opinion”? How would you explain your opinion on school tests, budget cuts, crime, immigration, safety and security issues?  No doubt that your persuasiveness relies on your arguments. But your ability to influence and convince critically depends on the way you frame your message.
In today’s world, you often need to reduce a complex reality to a concise and convincing message. Framing is an approach that deals with the way we convey our message: our words, images, and metaphors. To take one basic characteristic, a good frame engages the listeners’ values and emotions – it is easy to remember and it is something that people will usually agree with intuitively.
When you enter into a debate, you might be faced with frames of your opponents – and you will have to reframe the debate. This game of framing and reframing makes the debate to look like a chessboard made out of words. Of course, politicians play this game, trying to pull the debate towards their own words and metaphors in order to win their audience. But the game can be found everywhere: in the world of business, science, media – even at home.
We invite you to join our journey of learning the game of framing and reframing. You will discover how this game is played, and how you can play it yourself. 
This course suits people who are engaged with and interested in public and political debates. Not only people from the public sector will find it useful, but also engineers, consultants, managers and anyone who wants to make an impact in discussions and debates.

Nous allons aborder tout d'abord les propriétés physiques des fluides : les états de la matière et la notion de viscosité. Un chapitre sera dédié à la tension de surface et à la capillarité. Nous introduirons ensuite le concept de similitude et l’utilisation des nombres adimensionnels. Nous allons alors considérer la statique des fluides à travers la loi de l'hydrostatique. La dynamique des fluides sera abordée en premier lieu par la cinématique. Ensuite, nous traiterons des équations de bilan avec notamment une application du théorème de conservation de l’énergie cinétique : le théorème de Bernoulli. Dans le dernier, nous montrerons que ce théorème relativement simple permet d’expliquer et de calculer des écoulements tels que ceux observés dans les rivières. Les vidéos du cours seront enrichies de vidéos d’expériences qui illustreront les concepts clés et par des quiz pour tester votre intuition et vos connaissances. Le dernier module vous permettra de piloter à distance une expérience d'hydraulique qui a lieu dans les laboratoires de l'EPFL.

This means that the flow speed is more than five times the speed of sound. In air at room temperature, the speed of sound is around 340 m/s, so a Mach 5 flow would have a flow speed of 1.7 km/s or just over 6,000 km/h. When a rocket launches a satellite into earth orbit, when a probe enters the atmosphere of another planet or when an aircraft is propelled by a supersonic combustion ramjet engine (a scramjet), hypersonic flows are encountered. Hypersonics – from Shock Waves to Scramjets introduces the basic concepts associated with flight at speeds greater than Mach 5 and takes students to the stage where they can analyse the performance of a scramjet engine that might be used in a future access-to-space system.When compressible flow occurs, how it behaves and when a flow becomes hypersonic

On traite ces circuits avec les lois élémentaires de l'électricité puis on développe une série de méthodes de combinaisons des éléments et de transformations du circuit qui mènent à leur simplification et permettent une analyse aisée des courants, tensions et puissances présents. Quelques circuits particuliers classiques sont présentés. 
Toutes ces méthodes sont premièrement développées en régime continu puis elles sont généralisées au régime alternatif, faisant intervenir le calcul complexe. L'importance du régime alternatif réside dans le fait qu'il est omniprésent au niveau de la distribution électrique domestique et industrielle.

Twenty years ago, we had no idea whether any of the countless stars out there beyond our solar system had planets or not.
Today, things are totally different. Over 1,000 planetary systems have been discovered. The universe is teeming with planets. And what strange planets they are - hot Jupiter-like planets skimming the surfaces of their stars, cold and lonely free-floating planets far from any star, planets made of diamond, planets with rain made of glass, super-Earths and even planets orbiting neutron stars. In this course, we’ll bring you up-to-date with the latest research on exoplanets, and how this research has revolutionised our understanding of the formation of solar systems like our own.
This course is designed for people who would like to get a deeper understanding of these mysteries than that offered by popular science articles and shows. You will need reasonable high-school level mathematics and physics to get the most out of this course.

The function of the brain is to govern behavior, and the aim of this course is to causally link biophysical mechanisms with simple behaviors studied in mice. The brain processes information through the concerted activity of many neurons, which communicate with each other through synapses organised in highly dynamic networks. The first goal of the course is to gain a detailed understanding of the structure and function of the fundamental building blocks of the mammalian brain, its synapses and neurons. The second goal is to understand neuronal networks, with specific emphasis on the interactions of excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic neurons. The third goal is to place neuronal network function in the context of sensory processing ultimately leading to behavioral decisions and motor output.Fundamental aspects of neuroscience related to mammalian brain function

In this course, you will learn how to interpret the often contradictory ideas about how, why, where and when dogs arose.
Geneticists, archaeologists, anthropologists and behavioral scientists offer a variety of often opposing ideas about how dogs—the first domesticated species—arose. Some place the origin of dogs over 100,000 years ago; others place the start of dogs just 12,000 years ago. Claims for the location of the origin of dogs range from China to Europe and many places in between. Diverse scholars have suggested dogs arose as trash scavengers or as hunters’ helpers.
This course will provide you with the tools you need to find your own way through the confusing claims about the origin of dogs.
This course is part of the Dog Behavior and Cognition XSeries. 
No previous knowledge of any of the sciences contributing to the origins of dogs is assumed. Form your own assessment of the mysterious origins of “man’s best friend.”

You will design animations and games in which a number of objects move around the screen. You will also design programs that operate on family trees and other hierarchical structures.
But even as your programs get more complex, you will find that the design method makes them easy to write; and that the resulting code is well-structured, well-tested and easy to maintain.

Then we focus on the two main measurement technologies: next generation sequencing and microarrays. We then move on to describing how raw data and experimental information are imported into R and how we use Bioconductor classes to organize these data, whether generated locally, or harvested from public repositories or institutional archives. Genomic features are generally identified using intervals in genomic coordinates, and highly efficient algorithms for computing with genomic intervals will be examined in detail. Statistical methods for testing gene-centric or pathway-centric hypotheses with genome-scale data are found in packages such as limma, some of these techniques will be illustrated in lectures and labs.
Given the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you. If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology lectures. Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty relatively quickly across the first three courses. By the third course will be teaching advanced statistical concepts such as hierarchical models and by the fourth advanced software engineering skills, such as parallel computing and reproducible research concepts.

Enhanced throughput: Almost all recently manufactured laptops and desktops include multiple core CPUs. With R, it is very easy to obtain faster turnaround times for analyses by distributing tasks among the cores for concurrent execution. We will discuss how to use Bioconductor to simplify parallel computing for efficient, fault-tolerant, and reproducible high-performance analyses. This will be illustrated with common multicore architectures and Amazon’s EC2 infrastructure.  
Enhanced interactivity: New approaches to programming with R and Bioconductor allow researchers to use the web browser as a highly dynamic interface for data interrogation and visualization. We will discuss how to create interactive reports that enable us to move beyond static tables and one-off graphics so that our analysis outputs can be transformed and explored in real time.
Enhanced reproducibility: New methods of virtualization of software environments, exemplified by the Docker ecosystem, are useful for achieving reproducible distributed analyses. The Docker Hub includes a considerable number of container images useful for important Bioconductor-based workflows, and we will illustrate how to use and extend these for sharable and reproducible analysis.

Throughout the case studies, we will make use of exploratory plots to get a general overview of the shape of the data and the result of the experiment. We start with RNA-seq data analysis covering basic concepts of RNA-seq and a first look at FASTQ files. We will also go over quality control of FASTQ files; aligning RNA-seq reads; visualizing alignments and move on to analyzing RNA-seq at the gene-level: counting reads in genes; Exploratory Data Analysis and variance stabilization for counts; count-based differential expression; normalization and batch effects. Finally, we cover RNA-seq at the transcript-level: inferring expression of transcripts (i.e. alternative isoforms); differential exon usage. We will learn the basic steps in analyzing DNA methylation data, including reading the raw data, normalization, and finding regions of differential methylation across multiple samples. The course will end with a brief description of the basic steps for analyzing ChIP-seq datasets, from read alignment, to peak calling, and assessing differential binding patterns across multiple samples.

Contracts are promises that the law will enforce. But when will the law refuse to honor a promise? What happens when one party does not hold to their part of the deal?

We are exposed to contracts in all areas of our life — agreeing to terms when downloading a new computer program, hiring a contractor to repair a leaking roof, and even ordering a meal at a restaurant. Knowing the principles of contracts is not just a skill needed by lawyers, it illuminates for everyone a crucial institution that we use all the time and generally take for granted.

This contract law course, with new materials and updated case examples, is designed to introduce the range of issues that arise when entering and enforcing contracts. It will provide an introduction to what a contract is and also analyze the purpose and significance of contracts. Then, it will discuss the intent to create legal relations, legality and morality, and the distinction between gifts and bargains. The course also investigates common pitfalls: one-sided promises, mistake, fraud, and frustration. With the knowledge of what makes contracts and how they can go wrong, Professor Fried will discuss remedies and specific performance. Finally, Professor Fried will introduce how contracts can create rights for third parties. 

The course’s instructor, Charles Fried, has been teaching at Harvard Law School for more than 50 years and has written extensively on contracts. Not only is Professor Fried a leading authority on contract law, but he also utilizes a story-telling approach to explaining the topic, which creates a unique and interesting class experience.

Xamarin.Forms lets you build mobile applications using C# and then run them on the most popular mobile platforms today. If you are not familiar with the C# programming language, it is recommended that you visit this Programming with C# course to learn the fundamentals of the language before proceeding through this course.
Xamarin.Forms takes code sharing to the next level by allowing you to share not just your application logic in a cross-platform fashion, but also the UI definition. Unlike other technologies, applications that rely on the Xamarin.Forms framework are 100% completely native applications that look and feel natural on each platform.
With Xamarin.Forms, you can write your application code once, and then build a native application that utilizes that code to run on almost any iOS, Android or Windows device including Windows 10. Your business logic can be written in C# (or any other .NET capable language) and your UI can either be defined in code, or in the XAML markup language.What is Xamarin and how does it work?

While the development of cities in different parts of the world is moving in diverse directions, all estimations show that cities worldwide will change and grow strongly in the coming years. Especially in the tropics over the next 3 decades, it is expected that the number of new urban residents will increase by 3 times the population of Europe today. Yet already now, there is an extreme shortage of designers and urban planners able to understand the functioning of a city as a system, and to plan a sustainable and resilient city. To answer questions like: Which methods can contribute to the sustainable performance of a city, and how can we teach this to the next generations, the ETH Future Cities Laboratory in Singapore has produced over the last 3 years many necessary research results. “Future Cities” aims to bring these latest results to the places where they are needed most.
The only way to better understand the city is by going beyond the physical appearance and by focusing on different representations, properties and impact factors of the urban system. For that reason, in this course we will explore the city as the most complex human-made “organism” with a metabolism that can be modeled in terms of stocks and flows. We will open a holistic view on existing and new cities, with a focus on Asia. Data-driven approaches for the development of the future city will be studied, based on crowdsourcing and sensing. At first, we will give an overview of the components and dynamics of the future cities, and we will show the importance of information and information architecture for the cities of the future. The course will cover the origins, state-of-the-art and applications of information architecture and simulation. “Future Cities” will provide the basis to understand, shape, plan, design, build, manage and continually adapt a city. You will learn to see the consequences of citizen science and the merging of Architecture and information space. You will be up-to-date on the latest research and development on how to better understand, create and manage the future cities for a more resilient urban world.Explore the city as the most complex human-made “organism” with a metabolism that can be modeled in terms of stocks and flows

There has been a lot written about the fact that human beings do not process information and make decisions in an optimal fashion. This course builds on much of the fascinating work in the area of behavioral economics and allows learners to develop a hands-on approach by understanding its methods and more importantly, how it can be harnessed by suitably designing contexts to “nudge” choice.
In three modules, learners will be able to a). explain and interpret the principles underlying decision-making and compare the nudging approach to other methods of behavior change, b). learn how to critique, design and interpret the results of experiments; and c). design nudges and decision-tools to help people make better decisions.
Understanding experimental design and interpretation is central to your ability to truly use behavioral economics and will set you apart from people who merely know about the behavioral research. After the first two weeks learning the basic principles, we will devote two weeks to studying experimental design and analysis, and the final two weeks to understanding processes for designing nudges and for helping people make better decisions.
You will also witness and participate in weekly topical debates on various topics like “does irrationality impact welfare?” or “what strategy is better for improving welfare – nudging or education?” If you’ve been fascinated with the buzz surrounding behavioral economics but are not sure how to actually use it, this course is for you.
Several leading scholars, policy makers, business people, authors and commentators will briefly join our debate and discussion sections. These guest lecturers include Professor Sendhil Mullainathan (Harvard University), Professor John Lynch (University of Colorado), Rory Sutherland (Ogilvy Group), Owain Service (Behavioural Insights Team, UK Cabinet Office), Shankar Vedantam (NPR Columnist and Author – The Hidden Brain), Professors Andrew Ching, Avi Goldfarb, Nina Mazar, and Claire Tsai, Min Zhao (University of Toronto) and many others!Develop an understanding of the philosophy and the principles underlying the field of behavioral economics
Understand the differences between choice architecture / nudging and other approaches to behaviour change.
Understand the key elements of an experiment, differentiate between three basic types of experimental designs, and gain insight into ANOVA and regression techniques for analyzing data.
Use a prescribed process for designing your own nudges, and identify specific resources and tools you will need to execute a nudging strategy.
Apply some of the learnings and ideas to policy and business.</description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>424</course_id><title>Health Professional Teaching Skills – Level 2 – Strategies</title><published_date>2016-02-04T10:16:58-05:00</published_date><course_length>4 weeks</course_length><effort>1-2 hours per week</effort><subject>Education &amp; Teacher Training</subject><price>FREE

From modest beginnings 2,000 years ago, it has grown to encompass nearly a third of the human population. Diverse in languages, cultures, histories and creeds, Christians nonetheless share a common collection of sacred scripture called the Bible.
This religion course introduces you to the Bible and its scripture and asks the questions:
What are the contents, languages, and forms of Bibles in various times and places?
How have Christians lived out their stories and teachings?
How does Christian history reflect the contested and varied uses of scripture—in the ancient Roman world where Christianity began, in its spread through European and American colonialism, in the diverse forms it takes in varied locations around the globe?
You will begin to explore these questions and others while learning about the content and interpretations of these sacred texts.
No previous knowledge of Christianity or the Bible required.
This course is part of the World Religions Through Their Scriptures XSeries Program. What’s in the Bible, the book containing the sacred scriptures of Christians.
An overview of contents with a focus on diverse interpretations of well-known passages.
Exploration of select themes, such as how Christians approach diversity, attitudes toward non-Christian traditions, existential questions of suffering and violence, the encounter with modern science, the roles of women, liturgical time and pilgrimage.</description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>427</course_id><title>Fundamentos de Comunicaciones Ópticas</title><published_date>2016-02-16T16:10:38-05:00</published_date><course_length>8 weeks</course_length><effort>4 horas/semana</effort><subject>Engineering</subject><price>FREE

El tipo de enlace condiciona la interacción entre las moléculas de un compuesto. El estudio del enlace típico de un compuesto y de las interacciones entre sus moléculas es competencia de la Química, una materia básica que se estudia en muchas titulaciones universitarias. Este curso va dirigido a los alumnos que acceden a la Universidad, especialmente aquellos que no han cursado Química y que requieren de los conocimientos básicos en estos aspectos.
 
En este curso aprenderás a identificar los tipos de enlace que pueden presentarse en los diferentes compuestos químicos y a predecir qué tipo de enlace predomina en un compuesto en base a las características de los elementos que lo constituyen. Así mismo, podrás deducir qué enlace presenta un compuesto observando sus características y comportamiento. Profundizarás en el estudio del enlace covalente y entenderás la relación entre las interacciones moleculares y las propiedades físicas de los compuestos. En definitiva, adquirirás las habilidades necesarias para reconocer todo tipo de enlaces y relacionar la estructura de un compuesto con las propiedades físicas que manifiesta.

Apollo 11 landed on the moon in 1969, just eleven years after the first successful satellite launch (Sputnik in 1957) and forty-three years after Robert Goddard’s launch of the world’s first liquid fueled rocket. But the history of rocket development actually can be traced back more than 2,000 years to the experiments of Archytas, an ancient Greek Philosopher.
This aerospace history course will take you back in time and trace the many developments in technology that transformed rockets from celebratory accouterments to weapons and finally to launchpads for human space travel. It is a story of technology, but ultimately the emphasis on this course is about people. Some are very well-known, but others not so.
You will learn how the Chinese introduced rockets as weapons, how early experimenters succeeded through trial and error, how scientific advancement provided the foundation for rocket development and space travel, and how rocket use spread throughout the world prior to the modern era. Finally, you will be introduced to the contributions of rocket pioneers such as Tsiolkovsky, Oberth and Goddard who dreamed of and paved the way for space travel. The course culminates with an introduction of German rocket development in the early 1930s and the emergence the genius rocket engineer Wehner von Braun.

Unfortunately, lending money is a risky business - there is no 100% guarantee that you will get all your money back. If the borrower defaults, you will face losses in your portfolio. Or, in a bit less extreme scenario, if the credit quality of your counterparty deteriorates according to some rating system, the loan will become more risky. These are typical situations in which credit risk manifests itself.
According to the Basel Accord, a global regulation framework for financial institutions, credit risk is one of the three fundamental risks a bank or any other regulated financial institution has to face when operating in the markets (the two other risks being market risk and operational risk). As the 2008 financial crisis has shown us, a correct understanding of credit risk and the ability to manage it are fundamental in today’s world.
This course offers you an introduction to credit risk modelling and hedging. We will approach credit risk from the point of view of banks, but most of the tools and models we will overview can be beneficial at the corporate level as well.
At the end of the course, you will be able to understand and correctly use the basic tools of credit risk management, both from a theoretical and, most of all, a practical point of view. This will be a quite unconventional course. For each methodology, we will analyse its strengths as well as its weaknesses. We will do this in a rigorous way, but also with fun: there is no need to be boring.
Thanks to the wonderful feedback of last year’s students, the course has been further improved.

In this first module we’ll look at how individual neurons use electricity to transmit information.  We’ll invite you to build up a neuron, piece by piece, using interactive simulations, and we’ll take you on field trips in and around Harvard and Boston, bring you into the lab, and show you how to conduct DIY neuroscience experiments on your own.
Lessons will include video content, interactive content, forum spaces associated with the lessons, and in Lessons 3, labs and lab content.
You can move around within the lessons at your own pace. The only 'graded' part of the course is your final exam. You don't have to get everything correct to 'complete' lessons, you just have to engage with the content!

This course introduces the two primary methods used to determine the geometrical structure of molecules: molecular spectroscopy and gas electron diffraction.
In molecular spectroscopy, molecules are irradiated with light or electric waves to reveal rich information, including:
Motions of electrons within a molecule (Week 1),
Vibrational motions of the nuclei within a molecule (Week 2), and
Rotational motions of a molecule (Week 3).
In the gas electron diffraction method, molecules are irradiated with an accelerated electron beam. As the beam is scattered by the nuclei within the molecule, the scattered waves interfere with each other to generate a diffraction pattern. In week 4, we study the fundamental mechanism of electron scattering and how the resulting diffraction images reveal the geometrical structure of molecules.
By the end of the course, you will be able to understand molecular vibration plays an important role in determining the geometrical structure of molecules and gain a fuller understanding of molecular structure from the information obtained by the two methodologies.

많은 사람들이 훌륭한 아이디어와 기술을 가지고 있습니다. 하지만 "당신의 고객은 누구입니까?"라는 단순하지만 피해갈 수 없는 질문 하나로 갈피를 못 잡고 무너지곤 합니다. 
MIT공대는 수년간 이 질문을 기업가 학생들에게 던지면서 아주 성공적인 결과를 이루어냈습니다. MIT동문들이 세운 2만5천6백개의 기업들은 2조 달러 규모의 수익을 창출해냈으며 330만여개의 일자리를 만들어냈습니다. MIT가 국가였다면 세계에서 11번째로 큰 경제강국이 됐을 것입니다. 
여러분도 이 MIT 국가의 국민이 되어보세요. 여러분의 스타트업 여정을 MIT와 함께하시면서 성공의 핵심이 될 고객에 대해서 발견하는 시간을 가져보세요. 
이 강의는 기업가정신에 대한 수업으로  딱딱한 대학강의와는 거리가 멉니다. 매 수업시간마다 모바일 애플리케이션, 3D 프린팅, 전기전자, 국제개발, 손목시계 개발 등 다양한 분야의 MIT 출신 기업가들에 대한 심층적이고 전문적인 사례연구가 준비되어 있습니다. 
이러한 사례연구를 통해 여러분의 아이디어나 기술이 제품 단계로 넘어갔을 때 누가, 또 왜, 제품 구매의향을 가지게 되는지에 대한 공부를 할 것입니다. 과제물은 실제상황에 기반한 예제로 구성되어 있습니다. 구체적이고 실용적이며 효율적인 과정단계를 통해 예제를 풀면서, 이를 여러분 아이디어의 실체를 찾는 데 적용한다면 큰 도움이 될 것입니다. 
그럼 즐거운 수업 되시길 바랍니다!

Este curso está actualmente en modo autónomo o “self-paced”. ¿Qué significa esto? Que puedes empezarlo cuando quieras y seguirlo a tu ritmo ya que no hay fecha prevista de cierre y cada 6-8 semanas se generarán certificados a aquellos que lo hayan superado. Por otro lado los profesores participarán algo menos en los foros, seguirás teniendo soporte por su parte pero es posible que tarde algo más en contestar tus dudas.

   To understand fundamental changes in government, the economy, and society that took place between the late eighth and eleventh century. In this period, the state aristocracy gave way to new literati elite, educated men who sought to enter government through competitive examinations. A new kind of Confucianism took shape, which prized the moral autonomy of individuals. With this, the later imperial period of China’s history begins.

This course teaches the basics of computer graphics that apply to all of these domains.

Students will learn to create computer-generated images of 3D scenes, including flybys of objects, make a real-time scene viewer, and create very realistic images with raytracing.  We will start with a simple example of viewing a teapot from anywhere in space, understanding the basic mathematics of virtual camera placement.  Next, you will learn how to use real-time graphics programming languages like OpenGL and GLSL to create your own scene viewer, enabling you to fly around and manipulate 3D scenes.  Finally, we will teach you to create highly realistic images with reflections and shadows using raytracing.CSE167x teaches the foundations of computer graphics. 
This course runs for 6 weeks and consists of four segments. Each segment includes an individual programming assignment:
Overview and Basic Math (Homework 0: 10% of grade)
Transformations (Homework 1: 20% of grade)
OpenGL and Lighting (Homework 2: 35% of grade)
Raytracing (Homework 3: 35% of grade)
This term, students who earn a total score of 50% or greater will have passed the course and may obtain a certificate from UC San DiegoX.
FAQ
What is the format of the class?
The class will consist of lecture videos, brief exercises, and homework assignments. Each of the four segments of the course will have 2-3 lectures. Each lecture includes 3-5 lecture videos, which last between 10 and 20 minutes. There will be a brief exercise after each lecture video to help you test your understanding of the material. 
Your score will be determined entirely by programming assignments for which you will receive immediate autograder feedback. You may submit your assignment to the autograder multiple times; only your last submission will count.
Programming projects are to be implemented individually without copying code from other students, largely identical online resources, or previous instances of the class. However, short of posting or sharing actual explicit code, you are encouraged to collaborate and discuss problems in the discussion forums.
Will the text of the lectures be available?
Yes. All of our lectures will have transcripts synced to the videos.
Do I need to watch the lectures live?
No. You can watch the lectures at your leisure. You can "work ahead" if you want to move faster than the due dates. Conversely, you can progress at a slower pace. Please note that certificates will only be awarded to students who obtain the requisite score by turning in assignments by the established deadlines.
How much does it cost to take the course?
Nothing: the course is free. If you expect to be doing a lot of graphics programming in the future, we would recommend the OpenGL and GLSL programming guides, but it is by no means required to purchase them. There are many free online resources for these topics, and we will be posting links to them.
What computer system do I need for the course?
The course material involves C++/OpenGL/GLSL programming that is portable. We provide skeleton code for all major platforms (Windows, Mac OS, Linux). This is a modern course involving programmable shaders, but any machine built in the last few years should be adequate. We provide many compilation hints and tips, and Homework 0 is to ensure you can compile and work with the autograder. You do need some kind of C++ development environment; we provide several resources to get you started for Homework 0. In the highly unlikely event you cannot get your machine to work, you will hopefully have adequate time to find another system.
Will I learn Maya/DirectX/3D Studio Max etc.?
This is a course on the foundations of computer graphics and covers concepts, not the intricacies of a particular software package. That said, you will be able to write complex interactive and offline 3D graphics programs at the end of the course in C++, OpenGL and GLSL.
Can I contact the Instructor or Teaching Assistants?
Yes, but not directly. The discussion forums are the appropriate venue for questions about the course. The instructors will monitor the discussion forums and try to respond to the most important questions; in many cases response from other students and peers will be adequate and faster.
I have a disability (visual/hearing etc.) Can I take the course?
In most cases, yes. We provide transcripts for all lectures. Many leading computer graphics researchers have had visual impairments like color-blindness. However, this being a computer graphics course that relies on visual image comparisons, we probably cannot provide adequate support for those who are legally blind.
I have a busy schedule this fall. Can I still take the course?
The course does require about 12 hours per week of work, and the assignments (where you are given two weeks) require the time. Certificates of achievement require a passing score. Of course, you are welcome to just go through the lectures or attempt some of the assignments if you are not interested in a certificate; we hope to provide something for everyone.

Learn more about nutrition and how our diet profoundly impacts our current and future health.This introductory nutrition course addresses the relationship between nutrition and human health with a focus on health problems related to overnutrition.
In this course, Professor Sander Kersten from Wageningen University will introduce you to the chemistry of the three macronutrients fat, carbohydrate and protein. You will learn how macronutrients are absorbed, stored, and metabolized for energy, and you will gain a contemporary view of how different types of fats, carbohydrates and proteins affect human health. Moreover, NUTR101x will cover energy homeostasis and the regulation of bodyweight, and provides ample coverage of the topic of obesity. Finally, the course will make you familiar with nutritional research and research methodologies.
No previous knowledge needed. By completing this course, you will have the necessary tools to better weigh and interpret the information overload about nutrition and health.
NUTR101x is part of the Nutrition - Food for Health XSeries of Wageningen University. To continue learning, check out Nutrition and Health Part 2, which focuses on malnutrition. Broad view into the field of  nutrition

We start by learning the mathematical definition of distance and use this to motivate the use of the singular value decomposition (SVD) for dimension reduction and multi-dimensional scaling and its connection to principle component analysis. We will learn about the batch effect: the most challenging data analytical problem in genomics today and describe how the techniques can be used to detect and adjust for batch effects. Specifically, we will describe the principal component analysis and factor analysis and demonstrate how these concepts are applied to data visualization and data analysis of high-throughput experimental data.
Finally, we give a brief introduction to machine learning and apply it to high-throughput data. We describe the general idea behind clustering analysis and descript K-means and hierarchical clustering and demonstrate how these are used in genomics and describe prediction algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors along with the concepts of training sets, test sets, error rates and cross-validation.

고객이 나를 위해 무엇을 해줄 것인지 생각하지 말고, 내가 고객을 위해 무엇을 해줄 것인지 생각해라.
기업가정신 101 에서는 고객의 관점에서 세상을 바라보는 방법을 배웠습니다. 세상을 바라보는 참 멋진 관점이었죠?
그러나 아이디어를 구체화하는 여정은 여기서 멈추지않습니다. 물론 끝에 어느정도 가까이 왔지만 정말 끝에 다다르기 까지는 아직도 배워야할 것이 많이 남았습니다.
고객을 찾는 것과 동등하게 중요한 것이 바로 고객의 문제점을 해결해줄 수 있는 제품을 만드는 것입니다. 이를 위해 많은 질문을 해봐야합니다. 고객이 어떻게 제품을 획득하는가? 제품이 고객의 문제점을 어떻게 해결해줄 것인가? 제품이 어떤 가치를 지니고 있나? 나만의 '비밀소스'는 무엇인가? 나는 경쟁상대에 비해 어디에 위치하나?

During this process of change, the capital of a military empire that once invaded East Asia experienced occupation by the U.S. armed forces, hosted the Olympic Games, and transformed into a consumer hub where young people could enjoy economic “wealth.” It is important to know that this process was recorded in countless photographs, documentary films, TV programs, and so on. We will retrieve many of these archived pictures and videos and analyze what happened in postwar Tokyo from different perspectives. In Part 1, you will look at the changes that occurred in postwar Tokyo over a quarter of a century from four different perspectives: 1) occupation and Americanism; 2) imperial gaze and royal wedding; 3) The Olympic city; and 4) economic-cultural clash in Shinjuku. This examination of urban history will provide you with the insights necessary when considering changes in other large cities in Asia, such as Seoul, Beijing, and Bangkok, at the end of the twentieth century.Noteworthy factors which promoted the development and change of Tokyo in the postwar period
The impact of the U.S. occupation on the people and city of Tokyo
The change of “gazing” relationship between the emperor and people in Japan
The impact of Tokyo Olympic Games on the landscape of Tokyo

In postwar Tokyo, countless gazes fell upon others; gazes from and upon Americans and the Emperor, gazes going up skyscrapers or rushing aggressively through the cityscape, and gazes twining and wriggling among classes, genders, and ethnic groups in downtown Tokyo. In Part 2, we will focus on the geopolitics of these gazes in modern Tokyo. What kinds of gazes fell upon the war orphans, the poor, and the marginalized groups in Tokyo? How did students themselves, who represented the vast accumulation of knowledge in Tokyo, perform in front of these gazes? Moreover, how did cinema or television shows, as media for these gazes, implicate the whole city? In answering these questions, we will identify the geopolitics historically involved in the practice of “visualizing postwar Tokyo.”
 The way of the dynamic exchange of gazes in postwar Tokyo from different perspectives
How technologies for visualizing were developed and accepted by people in Tokyo
The research on the poor and the margins of urban society with the sociological theories behind them

In the smart city, the innovative use of data helps provide better and more inventive services to improve people’s lives and make the entire city run more smoothly. But the data our cities collect nowadays is more massive and varied, and is accessed at higher speeds than ever before. This is Big Data. New technologies are constantly being developed to better manage Big Data. This computer science course, from the IEEE Smart Cities initiative and the University of Trento, helps students understand and use these new technologies to help improve a city.
Our international team of instructors and content experts discuss the fundamental concepts of Big Data and how it has changed Data Management. They provide a vision for managing Big Data today, and how we can make Big Data work for the smart city.

First, the basic concepts of systems, dynamics, structure and control are introduced. Then, looking at many examples in Nature and human made devices, we will realize that the dynamic behavior of most systems can be modified by adding a control system. Later we will see how knowing how to evaluate the dynamic behavior of a system and measure its performance will provide the tools to design new controlled systems fulfilling some requirements.

By considering which are the benefits of control and the challenges for the future we will open the mind to tackle new applications and develop new scenarios from the micro-systems level to the common systems and the whole universe. An overview of the techniques available for a deeper introduction to the subject will be presented at the end.

Control technology is said to be a hidden technology. We do not notice it under normal operation, but it appears if a failure happens. Looking around in Nature and at human made devices, we realize that their behavior presents analogies and that we can manipulate their temporal evolution.

Characterizing the dynamic behavior of systems and the possibility to change it by introducing control devices is the main aim of the course. You will learn to analyze the dynamic properties of a system and the options to change its behavior according to some requirements.You will learn the basic concepts to undertake further studies in control engineering and its use in a variety of disciplines, from human and social sciences to any engineering field. learn to analyze the dynamic properties of a system and the options to change its behavior according to some requirements.

Ce questionnement d’ordre général peut trouver une première réponse dans l’étude historique de la confrontation entre christianisme et philosophie dans l’Antiquité. Cette confrontation a joué un rôle très important dans la constitution de la doctrine chrétienne. Elle prend la forme d’une polémique entre les chrétiens et les philosophes, mais également d’un rapprochement, les chrétiens reprenant à la philosophie un grand nombre de concepts et de modes de raisonnement pour penser, exprimer et défendre leur foi. On verra ce qui oppose le christianisme et la philosophie comme deux voies d’accès concurrentes à la vérité, avant d’envisager différents aspects de la dette du christianisme à l’égard de la philosophie antique. On se demandera pour finir quel a été le rôle du christianisme dans l’histoire de la philosophie en tant que telle.
Ce cours constitue une introduction au christianisme des origines ainsi qu’au monde intellectuel de l’Empire romain. Il permettra de comprendre comment se sont constitués les aspects centraux de la doctrine chrétienne. On évoquera aussi dans ce cadre les modalités pratiques de la production et de la transmission des idées dans l’Antiquité (papyrus, manuscrits) avec l’intervention de plusieurs spécialistes.

Where did the universe come from? How will it end? What is the nature of space and time?  For the first time in human history, we can give precise, reliable answers to many cosmological questions, thanks to a spectacular series of recent breakthroughs.  But many of the most fundamental mysteries remain unsolved. In this course we will cover the latest advances and the unsolved mysteries. We will explain the recent observations, and with the help of guest speakers Lawrence Krauss and Brian Cox, we will explore the theories behind modern cosmology.
This course is designed for people who would like to get a deeper understanding of astronomy than that offered by popular science articles and shows. You will need reasonable high-school level Maths and Physics to get the most out of this course.

Alrededor del 80% de estos teléfonos llevaban en su interior el sistema operativo Android. No cabe duda, por lo tanto, de que formarse en Android es una de las mejores inversiones que puede hacer un programador en la actualidad.
Como cabría esperar, escribir aplicaciones para dispositivos móviles no es lo mismo que hacerlo para ordenadores de sobremesa. Las aplicaciones móviles deben ser capaces de ejecutarse en un rango enorme de dispositivos, no solo teléfonos, sino también relojes, pulseras, coches y televisores. Android da una respuesta satisfactoria a estos desafíos en código abierto y recientemente ha añadido plataformas como Android Wear, Android TV y Android Auto, que abren una nueva frontera de desarrollo.
El objetivo de este curso es que los estudiantes aprendan los fundamentos de la programación en Android mediante el desarrollo paso a paso de una aplicación. Al finalizar el curso cada estudiante habrá completado un pequeño juego casi sin darse cuenta, adquiriendo los conocimientos necesarios para utilizar los principales elementos de Android como son las actividades, los ficheros de diseño, las intenciones, los fragmentos, los menús, los diálogos, las preferencias, etc.

Professor Y. Tzvi Langermann presents a case study that builds from a unique 15th-century volume in which three important medical manuscripts in Hebrew and Judeo-Arabic (Arabic in Hebrew characters) are sewn together. He will not only walk the student through the basics of medical knowledge training and practice in the Jewish Middle Ages and beyond, but he will also show how clues gleaned from the particular elements of a manuscript (such as marginal notes, mistakes, and handwriting) allow us to learn a great deal that we could not have gleaned from a pristine printed version. The course is made up of eight short video lectures (5-7 minutes each) that explore the fascinating highlights of an extraordinary manuscript.
While no previous knowledge is required, this course will be of most interest to advanced students of Jewish and medieval medicine studies in that it introduces a rare and fascinating medical text from the University of Pennsylvania’s manuscript collections.What manuscripts can teach us that other printed works cannot

Together, these tools are called the “MEAN stack.”
This is an advanced course for experienced web developers. In this course, we will introduce the essential concepts of the MEAN stack using a fast-paced, learn-by- doing approach. As a concrete example, we will walk through building a retail application. This online store will enable users to search for products, add them to their cart, and check out using Stripe, an online payment processor. You’ll build your own REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) server from scratch using MongoDB schema design principles, as well as a web application using AngularJS and a hybrid mobile application using the Ionic framework.

But what is CSR? What does it mean, and what does it involve? Do stakeholders really care, and if they do, how should companies communicate with them? In uncertain modern climates, CSR is a crucial driving force of a (r)evolution in business.
If you are interested in the relationship between business and society, this course is for you! It is especially relevant for industry, public policy, and academic professionals working on CSR, as well as students following a traditional business curriculum who are interested in key value questions. The content is also accessible for consumers who are curious about how to make informed decisions while pursuing their own well-defined, long-term, responsible consumption goals.
This course addresses CSR in two ways:
As a reflection of corporate self-awareness
As a source of innovation and a means to deal with heightened competitiveness, demands for sustainable development, and shifts in international governance
By presenting insights from CSR experts, from both academia and practice, this course provides a way for managers, consumers, and citizens to acquire in-depth insights and critical perspectives on companies’ CSR activities and communications. The multi-industry case study structure of this course enables participants to confront the challenges facing today’s managers as they seek to develop and communicate their own CSR initiatives. Dedicated discussion forums also are available for participants to present personalized CSR cases.
To help participants manage and communicate about CSR with various internal and external stakeholders, this course seeks to:  
Support current and future business leaders in their efforts to make responsible leadership, sustainable production, and consumption central to their corporate vision.  
Help citizens to function more effectively as informed watchdogs and responsible consumers. Understand the multidimensional nature and content of corporate social responsibility
Adopt a critical perspective on managerial practices related to societal issues
Stimulate and manage impactful changes in organizations, toward more responsible postures

Introduction to Project Management is an ideal starting point if you need to manage projects at work or at home, while not necessarily being a formally trained project manager. It is also suitable if you are considering undertaking a project in the near future and are seeking to learn and apply essential project management knowledge and skills.
To deliver a project successfully, it’s important to start by clearly identifying what the project is, and what its outcomes will be. In the course, we will show you practical ways to explore and understand your goals from the outset of your project, and to consider all the factors that may affect its execution. Step by step you will learn how to plan, scope, schedule, cost and manage your project from beginning to end. Since every project relies on the people who are delivering it, the course also enables you to explore how you can effectively communicate, manage people and employ leadership skills to successfully deliver your own project.
In Introduction to Project Management, you will learn practical ways to use project management skills, whether your project is large or small. Join us to explore how you can benefit from using project management techniques in your own projects.Core knowledge and applied skills in project management

For instance, how innovative energy technologies merge into the existing energy system, or how new transport possibilities impact current processes. Armed with this information, learn to decide whether they should be further developed, consider possible negative results and weigh associated costs.
There are multiple ways to make decisions, but one way proven to be very useful is the analytical approach - a methodology for making the problem explicit and rationalising the different potential solutions. In short: analysis based support of decision making, design and implementation of solutions.
Creative Problem Solving and Decision Making as a course teaches you this method.
This course explores and evaluates tools and problem solving methods such as:
Actor analysis
Causal modeling
Goal trees and means-end diagrams
Problem diagrams
Uncertainty
Decision support
Score cards
This course introduces each technique and applies each technique to a case. Ultimately, the combination of these techniques provides a coherent analysis of the problem.

This environmental studies course will examine the principles of production ecology and the ‘availability pillar’ of global food security that lie at the heart of food production, which can be applied to both crops and animal production. This course will discuss why yields in some parts of the world are lagging behind and identify the agro-ecological drivers that shape the wide diversity of production systems.
Furthermore, key issues relating to the closing of yield gaps and the difference in visions of sustainability will be explored.
This online course will be of great interest to international students and those with varied educational backgrounds, both professionally and culturally, to enrich their views and action perspectives related to global food security and food systems. Professor Ken E. Giller will introduce learners to crop production and underlying bio-physical principles in order to identify constraining factors in yield formation. He will explain how to assess yield gaps at the level of fields and production systems around the world, contributing to efficient resource management. Wageningen University and Research, through its unique systems-based approach to food systems, adds the phase of primary production to the broad context of global food security.Value the main issues related to global food production and consumption
Regional differences between developed and developing countries

This urban planning course will focus on four areas that directly affect livability in a city: Urban energy, urban climate, urban ecology and urban mobility. The course begins by presenting measurable criteria for the assessment of livability, and how to positively influence the design of cities towards greater livability. We will focus on this basic topic of the human habitat in a holistic way, and introduce possibilities of participatory urban design by citizens, leading towards the development of a citizen design science.
You will be able to share your experiences with the other participants in the course and also with the experts from the teaching team. In completing this course, you will better understand how to make a city more livable by going beyond the physical appearance and by focusing on different properties and impact factors of the urban system.
Livability in Future Cities is the second course in a series of MOOCs under the title “Future Cities.” This series aims to bring the latest research on planning, managing and transforming cities to places where this knowledge has the highest benefit for its citizens. “Future Cities” provided an overview, and this course will focus on livability in existing and new cities.  </description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>552</course_id><title>Aplicaciones de la Teoría de Grafos a la vida real II</title><published_date>2016-03-03T17:24:08-05:00</published_date><course_length>4 weeks</course_length><effort>3 horas a la semana</effort><subject>Computer Science</subject><price>FREE

Most organizations require lots of storage because users and applications are constantly working with and creating data.
As a Microsoft Windows Server System Administrator you must be able to:  
Identify and decide on the type of storage your organization needs
Manage disks, volumes, and file systems
Use BitLocker to secure volumes
Encrypt data with Encrypted File System (EFS)
Furthermore, optimizing Microsoft Windows Server storage is key to keeping pace with your organization’s ever increasing data needs. Once you have initially configured your Microsoft Windows Server storage you will want to take advantage of three key features: iSCSI Storage, Storage Spaces and Data Deduplication.
iSCSI is a protocol that supports remote access to SCSI-based storage devices over a TCP/IP network. It provides and easy to use alternative to Storage Area Networks (SANs) and can use existing infrastructure.
Storage Spaces lets you group physical disks together and present them as a single logical disk. This makes it easy to manage and dynamically allocate storage.
Data Deduplication is a service that identifies and removes duplications within data. The goal of Data Deduplication is to maximize the use of disk space.
Go beyond simple storage strategies and take control of your organization’s storage needs!

Calculus is an elementary Mathematical course in any Science and Engineering Bachelor. Pre-university Calculus will prepare you for the Introductory Calculus courses by revising four important mathematical subjects that are assumed to be mastered by beginning Bachelor students: functions, equations, differentiation and integration. After this course you will be well prepared to start your university calculus course. You will learn to understand the necessary definitions and mathematical concepts needed and you will be trained to apply those and solve mathematical problems. You will feel confident in using basic mathematical techniques for your first calculus course at university-level, building on high-school level mathematics. We aim to teach you the skills, but also to show you how mathematics will be used in different engineering and science disciplines.

Entenderás el comportamiento de los gases y las disoluciones y aplicarás las leyes que regulan su comportamiento en los procesos químicos en los que participan.
 
La ecuación química representa lo que sucede cuando tiene lugar un proceso en el que unas sustancias se convierten en otras mediante una “reacción química”.

En las reacciones se cumple la ley de la conservación de la masa y es posible calcular las cantidades de reactivos que reaccionan y de productos que se obtienen.
 
El estudio de las reacciones químicas y de los aspectos cuantitativos de las mismas, es decir su “estequiometría”, es competencia de la Química, una materia básica que se estudia en muchas titulaciones Universitarias.
 
Este curso va dirigido a los alumnos que acceden a la Universidad, especialmente aquellos que no han cursado Química y que requieren de los conocimientos básicos en estos aspectos.
 
Las unidades que trataremos:
Conceptos básicos: masa, mol y fórmula química
Gases. Ecuación de los gases ideales
Disoluciones y formas de expresar la concentración
Ecuaciones y reacciones químicas
Estequiometría y cálculos en reacciones completas
Reacciones reversibles y cálculos estequiométricos en el equilibrioAprenderás los conceptos básicos relacionados con las reacciones químicas

How can you motivate students to ask probing questions and seek complex answers? How can you bridge their historical knowledge with a lifelong commitment to civic action?
With this course, middle and high school teachers will find new ways to engage students in and out of the classroom. Co-taught by Dr. Kathy Swan, Professor of Education at the University of Kentucky, and Naomi Coquillon, Manager of Youth and Teacher Programs at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History, this course will offer teachers useful and readily applicable strategies and tactics to incorporate inquiry-based learning methods into their existing history lessons.
The course brings together the new College, Career and Civic Life (C3) Framework for Social Studies with the Smithsonian’s hands-on, museum-based educational techniques that bring historical artifacts to life for millions of visitors each year. Through explanation, demonstration, and dynamic examples, the course offers teachers practical ideas for how to entice students to craft complex and incisive questions; think critically about primary and secondary historical sources; form and support their opinions with evidence; and communicate their conclusions in ways that will prepare them to be engaged citizens of the world. Demonstrations will feature the Smithsonian National Museum of American History’s exhibitions and vast collection of historical artifacts and will offer ideas and resources to help teachers everywhere incorporate object- and inquiry-based teaching techniques and Smithsonian online resources into their own classrooms.
Students who complete the course will have a portfolio comprised of three lesson seeds and one completed lesson plan that has been reviewed by the course instructors. Work for the course including completion of the portfolio will constitute 30 learning hours. Students who successfully complete this course will have the option of receiving grade reports as well as a letter of verification of completion from Smithsonian that they can present when applying for continuing education credit with their districts.How to use and apply the inquiry arc of the C3 Framework for Social Studies, engaging students in a deeper process of historical inquiry

Dans quel contexte ces décisions sont-elles adoptées ? Au 21ème siècle, de nombreux paradoxes brouillent la vision que nous pouvons en avoir. Qu’est-ce que le pouvoir dans la société actuelle ? Quels acteurs en détiennent ? L’État demeure-t-il un acteur politique majeur s’il est concurrencé par des organisations internationales et régionales ? Comment la démocratie prônée par la communauté internationale se différencie-t-elle des régimes autoritaires voire totalitaires ? Quelle est la place des idéologies dans le monde actuel ? Le cours vise à comprendre et à expliquer des phénomènes politiques à partir d’une posture d’analyse critique.
Politics impact all of us: everyday political decisions impact many areas of our lives. In which context are these decisions made? In the 21st century, many paradoxes blur our vision of these decisions. What is power in a multi-level society? Does the state remain the main political actor, if it is in competition with international and regional organizations? Can democracy – pushed forward by the international community – coexist with authoritarian, or even totalitarian, regimes? What is the role of ideologies in contemporary politics? The course aims at understanding and explaining political phenomena from a critical standpoint. Définir et expliquer des concepts en science politique.

"¿Quién es tu cliente?"
 
MIT ha hecho esta pregunta por muchos años a sus estudiantes emprendedores – y con gran éxito.  Las 25,600 compañías fundadas por alumnos de MIT generan ingresos de US $2 trillones y han creado 3.3 millones de empleos. Si MIT fuese un país, sería la 11va economía más grande del mundo. 
 
¡Conviértete en un ciudadano de esta 11va economía más grande del mundo!  Únete a MIT en tu trayectoria empresarial a medida que descubres el recurso más esencial de tu startup - el cliente.

Esto es emprendimiento – así que no esperes una conferencia. Cada sesión de clase será un profundo y enfocado estudio de caso de emprendedores del MIT de diversas áreas como los son las aplicaciones móviles, impresión 3D, electrónica, desarrollo internacional y relojería.

Aprenderás, a través de historias de emprendedores del MIT, cómo pasar de la idea o la tecnología hacia la comprensión necesaria de quién y por qué querrá comprar tu producto. Específicamente, aprenderás cómo:
Identificar clientes prospectos
Entrevistarlos
Finalmente, elegir los clientes adecuados para tu negocio. 
Las asignaturas del curso serán ejercicios de la vida real que te guiarán a través de una concreta y práctica serie de pasos efectivos que te ayudarán en hacer tu idea muy real.

El viaje no para ahí. Ya que el santo grial de la especificidad  -  mientras aun al alcance – aún hay mucho que aprender antes de obtenerlo.

Así de importante que es encontrar a tu cliente, es el de crear un gran producto que resolverá el problema del cliente. ¿Cómo va a adquirir tu producto el cliente?   ¿Cómo resolverá el problema del cliente? ¿Qué valor traerá tu producto?  ¿Cuál es la salsa secreta?  ¿Cómo enfrentas a la competencia?

A partir de campos tan diversos como la inmortalidad virtual, la comercialización de la pequeña empresa, el diseño urbano, la enseñanza de idiomas, la asistencia de salud y los servicios de apoyo emprendedor, usamos casos de estudio de profundidad de los emprendedores para examinar la forma en como desarrollaron sus conceptos de productos, resolvieron el problema de su cliente, establecimos una clara propuesta de valor, refinaron su salsa secreta, y comprendieron a su competencia.
El viaje continúa. ¿Estás con nosotros? El cliente está esperando.

“Müşteriniz kim?”
MIT kendi öğrenci girişimcilerine bu soruyu yıllardır başarıyla soruyor.
MIT mezunları tarafından kurulan 25,600 şirket toplam 2 trilyon dolarlık gelir elde ediyor ve 3,3 milyon kişilik istihdam sağlıyor. MIT bir ülke olsaydı, dünyanın en büyük 11. ekonomisine sahip olurdu.
Siz de bu en büyük 11. ekonominin bir vatandaşı olun! Girişim yolculuğunuzda MIT’ye katılın ve yeni kurduğunuz şirketin en önemli kaynağı olan müşteriyi keşfedin. Girişimcilikten bahsediyoruz. 9 Ocak 2015'te başlayacak olan ve yaklaşık 3 ay boyunca tüm dünya ile aynı zamanda devam edecek Girişimcilik MBA programıyla Girişimciliğin temellerini öğreneceksiniz. Haftada yaklaşık 4 saatlik çalışmanız yeterli olacak. Uluslararası kalkınmadan saat üretimine kadar bircok farklı alanda çalışan MIT girişimcilerinin geniş kapsamlı vaka analizlerinden oluşan 12 haftalık program sayesinde bir fikir ya da teknolojiden yola çıkarak ürününüzü kimin neden almak isteyeceğine dair gerekli bilgilere sahip olacaksınız. Özellikle şunları öğreneceksiniz:
Muhtemel müşterileri tanımlamak
Onlarla görüşmek
Son olarak işiniz için uygun olan müşterileri seçmek.
Derste verilen ödevler gerçek hayata dayalı egzersizlerden oluşacak. Bu egzersizler, size fikrinizi gerçekleştirmenizi sağlayacak somut, pratik ve etkili adımlarla yol gösterecek.
Biraz eğlenmeye de hazırlıklı olun! Derse kaydolduktan sonra göreceksiniz ;-)
Bu derse tahminen ne kadar zaman ayırmalıyım?
Haftada yaklaşık 4 saat.
Derslerin metin hallerine erişebilecek miyim?
Evet. Bütün derslerin videolara uyumlu yazılı kayıtları olacak.

Girişimcilik 101 dersinde dünyaya müşteri gözünden bakmayı öğrendiniz, bu da sizin için mükemmel bir bakış açısı oldu!
Ama yolculuğumuz henüz bitmedi. Ufukta görünen kesinliğe ulaşmamız için daha öğrenmemiz gereken çok şey var.
Müşterilerin sorunlarını çözecek harika bir ürün yaratmak en az müşteri bulmak kadar önemli olan bir unsur. Müşteriniz ürününüzü nasıl edinecek? Bu ürün müşterinin sorununu nasıl çözecek? Ürününüz ne gibi bir değer getirecek? Başarınızın sırrı nedir? Rekabet noktasında nasıl davranıyorsunuz?
Sanal ölümsüzlük, küçük işletme pazarlaması, kentsel tasarım, dil eğitimi, sağlık ve girişimci destek hizmetleri gibi birçok konudan yola çıkarak, girişimcilerin geniş kapsamlı vaka analizlerini kullanıyoruz. Girişimcilerin ürün kavramını nasıl geliştirdiklerini, müşterilerin sorunlarını nasıl çözdüklerini, nasıl net bir değer önermesi kurduklarını, başarı sırlarını ne şekilde geliştirdiklerini ve rekabeti nasıl anladıklarını inceleyebileceksiniz.
Yolculuk devam ediyor. Bizimle misiniz? Müşteriniz sizi bekliyor.

You see them every day: on clocks, in the stock market, in sports, and all over the news. Algebra is all about figuring out the numbers you don't see. You might know how fast you can throw a ball, but can you use this number to determine how far you can throw it? You might keep track of stock prices, but how can you figure out how much money you've made (or lost) in the market? And you may already know how to tell time, but can you calculate at what times a clock's hour and minute hands are exactly aligned? With algebra, you can answer all of these questions, using the numbers you already know to solve for the unknown. Algebra is an essential tool for all of high school and college-level math, science, and engineering. So if you're starting out in one of these fields and you haven't yet mastered algebra, then this is the course for you!
 
In this course, you'll be able to choose your own path within each lesson, and you can jump between lessons to quickly review earlier material. AlgebraX covers a standard curriculum in high school Algebra I, and CCSS (common core) alignment is indicated where applicable.

This course will start at the very beginnings of geometry, answering questions like "How big is an angle?" and "What are parallel lines?" and proceed up through advanced theorems and proofs about 2D and 3D shapes. Along the way, you'll learn a few different ways to find the area of a triangle, you'll discover a shortcut for counting the number of stones in the Great Pyramid of Giza, and you'll even come up with your own estimate for the size of the Earth.

Çoğunlukla yeniliği kendileri için önemli bir sorunu çözmek isteyen sıradan insanlar yaratıyor. Bunu siz de yapabilirsiniz.
Önce neye ihtiyacınız olduğunu düşünün. Sonra başkalarının da bunu isteyip istemediğini öğrenin. Eğer istiyorlarsa, önce kendiniz için geliştirdiğiniz bu yeni ürün veya hizmeti diğerlerine sunmak için kâr amaçlı veya kâr amaçlı olmayan bir girişim oluşturabilirsiniz.
Sonsuz sayıda kullanıcı yeniliği örneği var. Bir sörfçü, sörf yaparken selfie çekebilmek için GoPro'yu yarattı. Bir öğrenci flaş belleğini unuttuktan sonra Dropbox'ı buldu. İki parasız girişimci kirayı ödeyebilmek için salonlarını kiraya verince Airbnb ortaya çıktı. Girişimlerinin nasıl başarılı olduğunu bizimle paylaşacaklar.
Kullanıcı yeniliğini ortaya çıkaran profesör Eric von Hippel'ın verdiği bu derste hangi sorunları çözmeyi seçebileceğinizi ve yeniliklerinizi başkalarıyla nasıl paylaşabileceğinizi öğreneceksiniz.

What is the purpose of our lungs? What is the link between oxygen and life ? These questions open a vast field of discovery to help us understand respiration. This course is for anyone who wants to understand human respiratory physiology, the operation of respiration and the lungs.
Immersed in the heart of the university and hospital practice, you’ll learn from professors, health professionals, interns and medical students. Together we’ll discuss topics that are close to the world surrounding us: respiration during exercise, at high altitude, the role of air pollutants, asthma, and other important respiratory issues.
During the course experts will discuss specific and practical topics such as how to comprehend oxygenation of a patient, why and when to administer oxygen, and what hyperventilation means.
This course will also discuss in depth human anatomy, physical volumes and pressures of gasses, blood, oxygen, CO₂, lungs, tissues, smoking and chronic bronchitis.Explain and describe the principles of oxygenation, ventilation, transport and consumption of oxygen and gas diffusion between air and blood

Innovation isn’t confined inside the walls of research labs swarming with PhDs. More often than not, innovation is about ordinary people solving problems that matter to them personally. This could be you.
First, think about what you need. Next, find out whether others want the same thing. If they do, you can start a venture – for profit or non-profit - to supply others with the novel product or service you first developed for yourself.
The examples of user innovation are infinite. A surfer created the GoPro to take “selfies” while surfing. A student came up with Dropbox after forgetting his flash drive. Two broke entrepreneurs rented out their living room to help pay rent, and Airbnb was born. They’ll share their paths to startup success.
Taught by Eric von Hippel, the founding scholar of user innovation, this course will help you think about what problems you should choose to solve and how to share your innovations with others.
You can innovate.Identify a problem that you face
Solve your problem
Determine the best way to share your solution</description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>581</course_id><title>Data Science Orientation</title><published_date>2016-06-28T11:09:26-04:00</published_date><course_length>6 weeks</course_length><effort>2-4 hours per week</effort><subject>Data Analysis &amp; Statistics</subject><price>FREE

Finance for Everyone will showcase the beauty and power of finance. This introductory finance course will be a gateway into the world of finance and will examine multiple applications to apply to your everyday life. Join us to better understand how to apply frameworks and tools to make smart financial choices.
You will be able to value the impact of different choices available to you: from renting or buying, evaluating car, home and student loans, or deciding whether to go to college versus pursuing a new idea to simply understanding how the financial world works.
Starting with time value of money, the course will help you develop a full appreciation for the many applications of finance. Using real world examples, the course will enable you to understand and analyze many personal and professional decisions we confront on a daily basis. You will understand stocks and bonds, learn to allocate scarce resources in a value-add way, and adopt smart tools for making every day decisions.
Finance is simultaneously a way of thinking and a set of tools. Finance is everywhere. There are no prerequisites for this course except for a sense of curiosity and a positive attitude. However, a comfort level with algebra and numbers and an understanding of accounting (the language of business) will clearly help. We will, however, try to cover everything starting with fundamentals and highlight when there is a need to do some further work in specific subjects.Why finance is everywhere and how it affects all of us

Video lectures will be in Korean, with English subtitles. Discussions, quizzes, and other course content will be in English. This course is the first part of International Politics in the Korean Peninsula; the second part will start this Fall.
The course is introduced with two cases where politics brought tragedies: the hyper-inflation in Zimbabwe and the political idolization in North Korea. These two cases provide a good answer to why we study politics.
The central content of the course is organized into two modules. First, it will start with several chapters from Records of the Grand Historian (Chinese: 史記), Plutarch's Lives, and History of the Three Kingdoms (한국어: 삼국사기; Chinese: 三國史記) to find out four archetypes of politics: value creation/distribution in a political entity, conflict and cooperation among political entities, development and maintenance of an identity in a political entity, and leadership selection in an entity.
The second module of the course will link the four archetypes of politics with contemporary issues of inter-Korean politics and political events in North Korea. These issues will include the Korean Crisis in 2012, the arms race between the two Koreas, the power succession and the simultaneous (nuclear and economic) build-up strategy in North Korea, and upcoming political events.
Course videos are presented in Korean with English subtitles.

Are you interested in robotics, and have heard of, or tried, “line-following" or “PID control” and want to understand more?
Feedback control is a remarkably pervasive engineering principle. Feedback control uses sensor data (e.g. brightness, temperature, or velocity) to adjust or correct actuation (e.g. steering angle, motor acceleration, or heater output), and you use it all the time, like when you steer a bicycle, catch a ball, or stand upright. But even though applications of feedback are very common, the subject is an uncommonly compelling example of mathematical theory guiding practical design. In this engineering course we will introduce you to the theory and practice of feedback control and provide a glimpse into this rich and beautiful subject.
Each week we will begin with a mathematical description of a fundamental feedback concept, combined with on-line exercises to test your understanding, and will finish with you designing, implementing, measuring, and analyzing a hardware system, that you build, for controlling a propeller-levitated-arm feedback system.
You will not need a background in calculus or software engineering to succeed in this class but you should be familiar with algebra and mechanical forces, have some exposure to complex numbers, and be comfortable with modifying mathematical formulas in short computer programs.
This is a lab course, and in order to complete the weekly assignments, you will need to purchase/acquire a list of parts. To make sure you receive your parts before the class begins, you should register promptly, so that you can access the lists of parts and international vendors.How to set up a control system and understand and optimize its performance (the Arduino-controlled propeller-levitated arm)

This education and teacher training course is intended to give a brief introduction for academic or clinical-based educators who desire to learn the simulation pedagogy unique to healthcare environments.
Unfortunately, being a great clinical educator does not always translate into being a great simulation educator. In this course, you will learn best practices for simulation in healthcare education and why it’s so important. Faculty experts will show you how developing simulation curricular tools can be used to train and evaluate providers. While many educators use simulation, not all are utilizing it to its full potential. Simulation in healthcare is only growing and experience in this educational tool is beneficial to all that educate or have aspirations to have a positive affect on patient outcomes.

If the system also requires high performance (e.g. an industrial robot, a car, or an aircraft), the usual approach is to use a state-space feedback controller derived from a physics-based model. And when performance is less critical (e.g. for toys and appliances), the traditional choice has been to tune a low-cost proportional-derivative-integral (PID) controller.
Over the last few years, much has changed. The dramatic decline in the cost of accurate sensors and fast microcontrollers have made state-space controllers practical even for inexpensive toys. In addition, modeling approaches have become far more reliant on measurement and computation rather than physics and analysis. In this course, we examine the theory and application of this arc of alternatives to control, starting with PID, then moving to physical-modeling and state-space, and ending with state-space using measurement-based modeling. In each case, you will design and test controllers with your own copter-levitated arm, to solidify your understanding and to gain insight in to the practical issues.
PLEASE NOTE: This is intended to be an advanced course and students should have a background in linear algebra and differential equations, as well as some experience with control systems. IN ADDITION: THIS IS A BETA COURSE, THINGS WILL GO WRONG. We are testing a new type of on-line class, one where students use advanced concepts to design and then examine performance results on their own hardware. There will be difficulties, and we will be updating content and focus in response to student input.State Space Methodology

Together we’ll explore how structures work, why they were designed the way they were designed, how they support loads, and where forces flow through them.
More specifically we’ll:
Learn about funicular forms and how ropes and cables resist tension.
Discuss how columns, arches, and anti-funicular forms resist compression.
Discover how trusses, beams and walls resist loads. • Sketch the flow of forces through structures.
Compare and contrast different structural forms and systems to answer a range of questions such as: Why might an engineer choose a beam over a truss? How do the dimensions of a structure affect its response? How do engineers choose forms and systems to create structures that are both elegant and functional?
Join us in exploring the engineering of structures around us.

¿Consumen más, menos, o justo lo que necesitan?
¿Les gusta botar dinero cuando compran y consumen algo o estarían interesados en que no tuvieran que desperdiciarlo?
¿Por qué a veces consumen productos que no necesitan realmente?
¿Quieren seguir consumiendo los productos que compran actualmente sin sentirse culpables por los discursos ambientales sobre la protección del ambiente?
Si te has hecho alguna de estas preguntas antes o, por el contrario, nunca te las habías planteado, ¡Seguro disfrutarás este curso!
No existen los productos perfectamente sostenibles hoy en día. Por esto como compradores y consumidores debemos volvernos expertos en tomar las mejores decisiones posibles, con la mejor información disponible (e, incluso, exigir nueva información que no exista aún), sobre el valor que realmente queremos obtener de un bien o servicio, identificando las mejores oportunidades que nos ofrezcan las empresas para cuidar al ambiente y a la sociedad (al mencionar el cuidado del ambiente y de la sociedad, se incluyen ustedes mismos como compradores y consumidores)
Entonces, ¿de quién es la responsabilidad de que se sigan escuchando denuncias sobre la contaminación del ambiente por ejemplo? Todos los que estamos involucrados en el ciclo de vida de los bienes y servicios que compramos, tenemos la oportunidad de presionar para que los sistemas de producción y de consumo mejoren hacia un estado más sostenible que antes.Aprenderá a consumir de manera más consciente y solidaria los productos que compra

This biology and life sciences course provides an introduction to the complexities of wild animal behaviour, and how it is studied.
Over six weeks, learners will explore the various behaviours animals adopt in order to meet the challenges of their daily lives. We begin with how animals learn and communicate with each other, then move on to discuss how they find food, avoid predators, choose their mates, and rear their offspring.
This course is aimed at anyone looking to broaden their understanding of animal behaviour beyond nature documentaries or a typical high school education. No previous knowledge is required, only curiosity and enthusiasm for the subject.Key concepts to understand animal behaviour
The fascinating range and complexity of behaviour in animals
How scientific hypotheses are developed and tested
How animals learn and communicate

However, in the scientific community, there is little controversy with 97% of climate scientists concluding humans are causing global warming.
Why the gap between the public and scientists?
What are the psychological and social drivers of the rejection of the scientific consensus?
How has climate denial influenced public perceptions and attitudes towards climate change?
This course examines the science of climate science denial.
We will look at the most common climate myths from “global warming stopped in 1998” to “global warming is caused by the sun” to “climate impacts are nothing to worry about.”
We’ll find out what lessons are to be learnt from past climate change as well as better understand how climate models predict future climate impacts. You’ll learn both the science of climate change and the techniques used to distort the science.
With every myth we debunk, you’ll learn the critical thinking needed to identify the fallacies associated with the myth. Finally, armed with all this knowledge, you’ll learn the psychology of misinformation. This will equip you to effectively respond to climate misinformation and debunk myths.
This isn’t just a climate MOOC; it’s a MOOC about how people think about climate change.How to recognise the social and psychological drivers of climate science denial
How to better understand climate change: the evidence that it is happening, that humans are causing it and the potential impacts

Did you know that transposable elements, the genetic information that can move from location to location, make up roughly 50 % of the human genome? Did you know that scientists have linked their movement into specific genes to the causes of certain diseases? You’ll also learn how these “jumping genes” work and how scientists study them in Molecular Biology: Transcription and Transposition.
Are you ready to go beyond the “what" of scientific information presented in textbooks and explore how scientists deduce the details of these molecular models?
Take a behind-the-scenes look at modern molecular genetics, from the classic experimental events that identified the proteins and elements involved in transcription and transposition to cutting-edge assays that apply the power of genome sequencing. We've designed the problems in this course to build your experimental design and data analysis skills.
Let’s explore the limits of our current knowledge about the transcription machinery and mechanisms of transposition. If you are up for the challenge, join us in 7.28.2x Molecular Biology: Transcription and Transposition.
FAQ
Who can register for this course?
Unfortunately, learners from Iran, Sudan and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time. While edX has received a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to offer courses to learners from Iran and Sudan our license does not cover this course.
Separately, EdX has applied for a license to offer courses to learners in the Crimea region of Ukraine, but we are awaiting a determination from OFAC on that application. We are deeply sorry the U.S. government has determined that we have to block these learners, and we are working diligently to rectify this situation as soon as possible.How to compare and contrast transcription in prokaryotes and eukaryotes

The collection of skills required by organizations to support these functions has been grouped under the term ‘data science’.
This statistics and data analysis course will attempt to articulate the expected output of data scientists and then teach students how to use PySpark (part of Spark) to deliver against these expectations. The course assignments include log mining, textual entity recognition, and collaborative filtering exercises that teach students how to manipulate data sets using parallel processing with PySpark.
This course covers advanced undergraduate-level material. It requires a programming background and experience with Python (or the ability to learn it quickly). All exercises will use PySpark (the Python API for Spark), and previous experience with Spark equivalent to Introduction to Apache Spark, is required.How to use Apache Spark to perform data analysis

Each individual is unique and idiosyncratic. Yet, when we come together for a common purpose, we try to conduct ourselves in a manner that will achieve mutually desired outcomes. Sometimes we manage to achieve this; sometimes we don’t. Sociology is about that process. By understanding sociology and how we interact with each other, you can yield more personal and professional success.
In this sociology course, you will learn about the social processes groups of all sizes follow to form, function and evolve over time. You will also learn about the ongoing dynamic individuals actively create in their social environment and how they are shaped by it. This course provides an understanding of how the formation and longevity of a society is possible when its members are diverse in their values, beliefs, preferences and agendas.
You will learn about group dynamics, skills for effective interaction in groups and organizations, and obtain a deeper understanding of how sociology applies to everyday life and current events.

In this introduction to ancient Greek culture and literature, learners will experience, in English translation, some of the most beautiful works of ancient Greek literature and song-making spanning over a thousand years from the eighth century BCE through the third century CE: the Homeric Iliad and Odyssey; tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides; songs of Sappho and Pindar; dialogues of Plato, and On Heroes by Philostratus. All of the resources are free and designed to be equally accessible and transformative for a wide audience.

You will gain access to a supportive learning community led by Professor Gregory Nagy and his Board of Readers, who model techniques for “reading out” of ancient texts. This approach allows readers with little or even no experience in the subject matter to begin seeing this literature as an exquisite, perfected system of communication.
No previous knowledge of Greek history, literature, or language is required. This is a project for students of any age, culture, and geographic location, and its profoundly humanistic message can be easily received without previous acquaintance with Western Classical literature.

Imagine the brilliance of its colour in the glass, the ripe fruit aromas on the nose, a hint of toasty oak and lingering tannins on the back palate. Perhaps you like a specific wine, but can’t pinpoint the reason why. The attributes that make wine so enjoyable are achieved through the expertise of viticulturists and winemakers, whose decision-making in the vineyard and winery is underpinned by science – to be precise, viticulture and oenology.
The finer details can take years to learn, but in a matter of weeks this course will give you a broad understanding of the principles and practices used to grow grapes and make wine, and their impact on wine appearance, aroma, flavour and taste. You’ll also gain an appreciation for how cutting-edge research is helping to secure the future sustainability of the global wine industry. Whether you’re a wine novice or a seasoned oenophile,, this course is for anyone who loves wine and wine tasting. You’ll even get to make your own wine-- virtually at least!

Tout individu est un jour ou l’autre amené à épargner ou emprunter. La sélection des projets d’investissements et leur financement sont des questions cruciales pour les entrepreneurs ou managers. D’une manière plus large, les décisions prises par le monde politique en matières financières influencent directement ou indirectement le quotidien des citoyens. Les récentes crises financières ont pu nous montrer à quel point il peut être primordial de comprendre les fondamentaux de la finance. Sans un minimum d’éducation financière, il est difficile d’appréhender le fonctionnement du monde dans lequel nous évoluons. Ce cours introductif vous propose un cadre conceptuel et des outils pour vous aider à prendre des décisions financières judicieuses, avec un focus particulier sur les opérations financières courantes.   
 
Au terme de ce cours, vous serez capable de :
Décrire les principes fondamentaux du raisonnement financier : absence d’opportunités d’arbitrage dans un marché concurrentiel, intégration de la dimension temporelle et du risque dans la décision financière ;
Calculer des valeurs actuelles ou futures, de flux ou de séquence de flux ;
Appliquer les techniques de l’évaluation actuarielle aux opérations financières courantes (de type épargne ou emprunt) et aux principaux actifs financiers (actions et obligations) ;

Financial decisions impact all of us. As individuals we earn money, spend it, borrow it and at times save and invest it. At work, for managers or entrepreneurs, financial decisions are crucial. In the public sector , financial decisions made by politicians affect us every day. Without minimal financial literacy, it is very difficult to succeed, especially in light of the recent financial crises. This introductory course provides a framework and tools to help you make sound financial decisions, with a particular focus on common financial operations.
At the end of this course, you will be able to:
Describe the basics of financial reasoning: absence of arbitrage opportunity in a competitive market, decision-making based on both time and risk ;
Calculate present or future values of cash-flows or sequences of cash-flows ;
Apply the principles of valuation to value common financial operations (savings or loans) and main financial assets (stocks and bonds);
Use different criteria to select investment projects in firms ; 
Analyze capital budgeting problems, involving the relationship between expected return and risk ;
Determine the return a firm should use when facing an investment decision, and use this return to compute the value generated by a project ; 
Take more advanced courses in finance (corporate finance, portfolio management, financial markets, international finance, derivative securities, etc.).

Additionally, there are external forces and trends that can impact (positively or negatively) a supply chain’s efficiency and effectiveness.  Understanding the dynamics and risks within supply chains, both large and small, is key to being a successful supply chain professional. 
This course builds on the fundamental models introduced in SC1x and the design trade-offs covered in SC2x.  It is essentially a capstone in understanding how to successfully model, design, and manage a supply chain in any industry.  We will divide the course into three sections. 
First, we will introduce the field of System Dynamics.  Developed at MIT, system dynamics is an approach that examines and models complex systems that feature interacting, non-linear, and dynamic elements.  The objective is to better understand the underlying features of a complex system and to recommend policies and other actions to improve overall performance. 
Second, we will explore the concepts of supply chain risk.  Supply chains are subject to a wide number of potential disruptions – from both within and outside of the supply chain.  Students will understand how supply chains can be better designed and managed to not only mitigate the downside of supply chain disruption but also to leverage and capture any upside. 
Finally, the students will engage in a series of more extended case studies and simulations that demonstrate these complex relationships.  Actual case studies and examples from companies will be used to help students better prepare for actual situations.
This course is part of the MITx MicroMasters Credential in Supply Chain Management that is specifically designed to teach the critical skills needed to be successful in this exciting field. In order to qualify for the MicroMasters Credential you will need to earn a Verified Certificate in each of the five courses as well as pass a Capstone Exam. When you sign up for a CTL.SC3x Verified Certificate you will also be granted access to supplemental content such as additional practice problems and complementary videos.
MITx requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code. MITx will take appropriate corrective action in response to violations of the edX honor code, which may include dismissal from the MITx course; revocation of any certificates received for the MITx course; or other remedies as circumstances warrant.

The ecosystem of banks and financial markets (including Central Banks) has deepened in size, sophistication and complexity over the years. However, in recent times they have also been the subject of abuse, failures and economic distress in several countries resulting in a ‘contagion’ that has concurrently affected several countries around the world!
More recently, and perhaps more importantly, thanks to the liberalization of most economies, the world has witnessed an exponential increase in the free flow of capital across countries. Banking institutions and financial markets, being the predominant conduit for such free flow of capital across countries, have therefore become even more "globally interconnected." Such a globally interconnected financial system, combined with regulatory systems that are country-specific and hence varying considerably in rigor and implementation, has further compounded the risks and the consequent contagion, as witnessed in the global financial meltdown that was triggered in 2008.
This course on ‘Banking and Financial Markets’ comprises two parts:
In an earlier course, which was introductory in nature, we had looked at the theory and concepts underlying banking and financial markets, the products and instruments offered and the associated market mechanisms.
In this more advance course, we will look at Banking and Financial Markets from a Risk Management Perspective:
The embedded risks in any financial system: credit risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, operational risk, off-balance sheet risk, etc.
The contagion effect of these risks, as witnessed in the 2008 global financial meltdown
How are these risks identified, measured and managed, using several risk mitigation techniques and sound regulatory oversight.How to measure and manage credit risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, operational risk, off-balance sheet risk, etc. in any financial system.
How these risks have become ‘omnipresent’ and significantly more complex as a result of globalization and interconnectedness of banking and financial markets across countries.
Liquidity and solvency issues in financial institutions and markets and how they could be managed.
The structure of asset securitization and credit derivatives and their role in managing (sometimes augmenting) risks in any financial system.
How to measure, quantify and analyze the level and degree of financial risk over a stipulated time frame using different tools and techniques such as Value at Risk (VaR), Stress Test, etc.
The role of regulation and monetary policy to: (a) ensure the stability and longevity of any financial system and (b) minimize the impact of possible adverse outcomes and contagion effects implicit in any financial crisis, particularly when the financial systems are globally interconnected.</description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>653</course_id><title>AP® Computer Science Principles</title><published_date>2016-08-08T16:30:26-04:00</published_date><course_length>null</course_length><effort>5+ hours per week</effort><subject>Computer Science</subject><price>FREE

The first goal is to introduce you to the things that philosophers think about. We will look at some perennial philosophical problems:
Is there a God?
What is knowledge, and how do we get it?
What is the place of our consciousness in the physical world?
Do we have free will?
How do we persist over time, as our bodily and psychological traits change?
The second goal is to get you thinking philosophically yourself. This will help you develop your critical reasoning and argumentative skills more generally. Along the way we will draw from late, great classical authors and influential contemporary figures.
To help enhance your learning experience, this course offers instructor grading. If you choose to pursue a verified certificate, a professional philosopher will carefully read, grade and comment upon your work. Though all residential philosophy courses at MIT, and other major universities, offer instructor grading, this is an innovation in the world of MOOCs. Students will test their ideas against, and receive individual advice from, professional philosophers. We believe that this is the best way to learn philosophy.
NOTE: Enrollment for instructor grading will be capped.How to construct and analyze philosophical arguments

6.341x is designed to provide both an in-depth and an intuitive understanding of the theory behind modern discrete-time signal processing systems and applications. The course begins with a review and extension of the basics of signal processing including a discussion of group delay and minimum-phase systems, and the use of discrete-time (DT) systems for processing of continuous-time (CT) signals. The course develops flow-graph and block diagram structures including lattice filters for implementing DT systems, and techniques for the design of DT filters. Parametric signal modeling and the efficient implementation of DT multirate and sampling rate conversion systems are discussed and developed. An in-depth development of the DFT and its computation as well as its use for spectral analysis and for filtering is presented. This component of the course includes a careful and insightful development of the relationship between the time-dependent Fourier transform and the use of filter banks for both spectral analysis and signal coding.
6.341x is organized around eleven units each typically consisting of a set of two to four topics. The source material for learning each topic includes suggested reading in the course text, clarifying notes, other related reading, and video excerpts and will include an interactive on-line discussion forum. The course text is the widely used text by Oppenheim and Schafer (third edition). The video segments are adapted from live video recordings of the MIT residential course. 

Each topic includes a set of automatically-graded exercises for self-assessment and to help in digesting and understanding the basics of the topic, and in some cases to preview topics. A typical unit in the course concludes with a set of more extensive problems to help in integrating the topics and developing a deeper understanding. Automatic grading of your answers to these problems as well as solutions will be provided.
6.341x and this freely-available version were developed through the support and encouragement of the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, the MIT Office of Digital Learning, and the MIT Research Laboratory of Electronics.

This literature course will explore A Study in Scarlet, an 1887 detective mystery novel by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. This novel introduced the iconic Sherlock Holmes and his friend Dr. John Watson. The book's title comes from a speech Holmes gives to Doctor Watson about his work, saying: "There's the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it."

The story received little very public interest when it first appeared. In fact, only eleven complete copies of Beeton's Christmas Annual 1887 are known to exist. Many adaptations of Sherlock Holmes exist, however, and he continues to fascinate readers as an enigmatic detective.

Participants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion. Course materials will include background information for understanding the text, as well as vocabulary and language support. Assessment will include quizzes and short writing assignments.Read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence

How do we deal with the challenges and threats to vernacular architecture and make sure that it is sustained in this modern urbanized world? This is the key question we will try to answer in this course.
This architecture course takes you on a journey of understanding and appreciating the value of our everyday built environment. In the first two modules, we will explore the deeper socio-cultural meaning of rural vernacular architecture and look at the urban vernacular and challenges of people migrating from villages to live in cities; in module 3, we will focus on what we call ‘informal settlements’ in Asian cities; and in the final two modules, we will explore answers to a few questions that are very relevant to the current status and future development of vernacular architecture, such as:
How can we conserve and sustain our vernacular cultural heritage?
How can we reconcile tradition with modernity and originality?
We will also cast our eyes into the future, and discuss how the field of vernacular architecture might evolve and develop in the years to come.
Ultimately, the goal of this 5-week course is to help you establish your own viewpoints about the more complex or even contradictory issues in vernacular architecture, so you can make informed decisions regarding the protection and conservation of your local vernacular environments.
Special note: This course can be taken independently from The Search of Vernacular Architecture of Asia, Part 1.Deepen your appreciation of the values and meanings of vernacular architecture in your local environments
Establish your personal perspectives on the more complex issues in vernacular architecture, such as self-conscious or un-self-conscious way of building, informal settlements, and cultural sustainability

Descripción del curso
***Este curso será impartido en español***
La evidencia científica documenta que los efectos de la adversidad durante la primera infancia perduran en el tiempo y tienen consecuencias sobre el aprendizaje, la trayectoria escolar, los comportamientos de riesgo, el empleo, la salud y otras variables claves para la acumulación de capital humano y el bienestar de las personas.
En la última década los países de América Latina y el Caribe han demostrado un compromiso político y financiero para fortalecer las políticas de desarrollo infantil. Sin embargo, a pesar de estos esfuerzos, todavía existen retos significativos. Por ejemplo, hay muchos niños y familias de los estratos más pobres que no reciben servicios de desarrollo infantil. Además, se sabe que la calidad de estos servicios en la región es baja.
Este curso pretende fortalecer las capacidades de quienes diseñan, implementan y evalúan programas y políticas de desarrollo infantil, con énfasis en aspectos relacionados a la calidad.
Está comprobado que la calidad es indispensable para que los programas de desarrollo infantil resulten en cambios en la trayectoria de desarrollo sostenible en el tiempo.Qué es el desarrollo infantil y por qué la primera infancia es crucial para el desarrollo del capital humano
Por qué la familia y la comunidad son importantes en el proceso de desarrollo infantil

This course provides a practical overview for selecting, implementing, and evaluating educational technology initiatives.
Schools are recognizing the potential for technology to transform teaching and learning. However, bringing technology into the classroom in a productive way is easier said than done. How do educators and others decide what kind and type of educational technology to use in the classroom? Which stakeholders influence that decision? What factors determine the success or failure of educational technology initiatives? How do we determine if these implementations are successful? 
This course provides a practical overview for selecting, integrating, implementing, and evaluating educational technology initiatives in formal educational settings, primarily in the US. It will include the perspectives of stakeholders that make such initiatives possible, and consider how to evaluate for efficacy. The audience for this course includes current and future teachers, entrepreneurs, developers, practitioners, and leaders in educational technology. 
Through four units over seven weeks, participants will develop an awareness and understanding of the “ecosystem” surrounding the implementation of educational technology in a formal educational setting. Participants will work towards creating a final project that synthesizes the main ideas from the course. Describe factors that influence the integration, implementation, and evaluation of educational technology in a learning environment.
Set and define criteria, inspired by frameworks, for using educational technologies and match those criteria to potential resources.

***Este curso será impartido en español***
En las próximas décadas, las pensiones se convertirán en uno de los ejes centrales de las políticas económicas y sociales en América Latina y el Caribe (ALC).
¿La razón? En 2050 habrá en la región el triple de adultos mayores que ahora, con una mayor esperanza de vida y, por lo tanto mayores necesidades de atención.
Esos adultos mayores del futuro están hoy en un mercado de trabajo donde sólo 4 de cada 10 trabajadores contribuyen a un sistema de pensiones. Esto significa que en la actualidad 130 millones de personas están trabajando sin ahorrar para su pensión en ALC.
En ausencia de reformas, incluso con un crecimiento sostenido en la región, 1 de cada 2 jubilados no tendrá una pensión o esta no será adecuada, dejando entre 66 y 83 millones de adultos mayores dependiendo de las familias o del Estado para su manutención, lo que será económica, fiscal y socialmente insostenible.
Por otra parte, aquellos sistemas que prometen beneficios más generosos tienen baja cobertura y eventuales problemas de equidad y sustentabilidad. Lo que genera un importante desafío, ya que el aumentar la cobertura bajo el mismo diseño puede mejorar la situación financiera en el corto plazo, pero acrecentar los problemas de sustentabilidad en el largo plazo.
En este curso comprenderemos las complejidades que afronta el mercado de trabajo en ALC y, por ende, su sistema de pensiones. Vamos a esclarecer las políticas que se pueden formular en los diferentes contextos de la Región que podrían llevar a un funcionamiento de sistemas de pensiones más eficientes, financieramente sostenibles y equitativos y así ofrecer “mejores pensiones” a todos los adultos mayores, no solo a unos pocos.

Machine learning aims to extract knowledge from data, relying on fundamental concepts in computer science, statistics, probability and optimization. Learning algorithms enable a wide range of applications, from everyday tasks such as product recommendations and spam filtering to bleeding edge applications like self-driving cars and personalized medicine. In the age of ‘big data’, with datasets rapidly growing in size and complexity and cloud computing becoming more pervasive, machine learning techniques are fast becoming a core component of large-scale data processing pipelines.
This statistics and data analysis course introduces the underlying statistical and algorithmic principles required to develop scalable real-world machine learning pipelines. We present an integrated view of data processing by highlighting the various components of these pipelines, including exploratory data analysis, feature extraction, supervised learning, and model evaluation. You will gain hands-on experience applying these principles using Spark, a cluster computing system well-suited for large-scale machine learning tasks, and its packages spark.ml and spark.mllib. You will implement distributed algorithms for fundamental statistical models (linear regression, logistic regression, principal component analysis) while tackling key problems from domains such as online advertising and cognitive neuroscience.The underlying statistical and algorithmic principles required to develop scalable real-world machine learning pipelines

This literature course will examine James Joyce’s collection of fifteen short stories called simply Dubliners. This volume was first published in 1914, but not without a struggle. Joyce first submitted these stories to a publisher in 1905, and had it rejected 17 times before it was finally published in 1914. It has become one of the classics of English language literature, despite its rocky beginnings.

Dubliners depicts middle class Irish life in the early part of the 20th century. The first stories are narrated by protagonists who are children. As the stories continue, they examine the lives of characters in increasingly older stages of life. Interestingly, many of the characters who appear in these short stories appear later in minor roles in Joyce’s famous novel Ulysses.
 
Participants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion. Course materials will include background information for understanding the text, as well as vocabulary and language support. Assessment will include quizzes and short writing assignments.

Everyone involved in higher education has questions. Students want to know how they’re doing and which classes they should take. Faculty members want to understand their students’ backgrounds and to learn whether their teaching techniques are effective. Staff members want to be sure the advice they provide is appropriate and find out whether college requirements accomplish their goals. Administrators want to explore how all of their students and faculty are doing and to anticipate emerging changes. The public wants to know what happens in college and why.
Everyone has questions. We have the chance to help them find answers.
Practical Learning Analytics has a specific goal: to help us collectively ponder learning analytics in a concrete way. To keep it practical, we will focus on using traditional student record data, the kinds of data every campus already has. To make it interesting, we will address questions raised by an array of different stakeholders, including campus leaders, faculty, staff, and especially students. To provide analytic teeth, each analysis we discuss will be supported by both realistic data and sample code.About the landscape of learning analytics in higher education

A successful manager makes good decisions. To make good decisions, you need to understand the market forces that impact your business and personal life. This is true for managers in large multinationals or small businesses, in non-profit organizations or in the government. Individuals and households also make decisions. They decide on what to learn, where to work, how much to save, where to invest, and what goods to buy, among others. Most modern societies depend on markets to organize economic activity: they are market economies. A large number of decisions you make as individuals or as managers relate to markets. So it is important for you to know how markets work and how to make good decisions as a manager or as an individual operating in a market environment. This is what this course will teach you.
Most business schools have a course on Managerial Economics as part of the MBA curriculum. Exposure to Economics is essential for all students of management. This course will provide a simple introduction to Managerial Economics and use minimum mathematics.How markets work; supply, demand and market equilibrium
Elasticity of supply and demand, taxes and subsidies

Phenomena as diverse as the motion of the planets, the spread of a disease, and the oscillations of a suspension bridge are governed by differential equations. MATH226x is an introduction to the mathematical theory of ordinary differential equations. This course follows a modern dynamical systems approach to the subject. In particular, equations are analyzed using qualitative, numerical, and if possible, symbolic techniques.
MATH226 is essentially the edX equivalent of MA226, a one-semester course in ordinary differential equations taken by more than 500 students per year at Boston University. It is divided into three parts. MATH226.3x is the last part.

Are you ready to leave the sandbox and go for the real deal? Have you followed EX101x Data Analysis: Take It to the MAX() and EX102x Data Analysis: Visualization and Dashboard Design and are ready to carry out more robust data analysis?
In this project-based course you will engage in a real data analysis project that simulates the complexity and challenges of data analysts at work. Testing, data wrangling, Pivot Tables, sparklines? Now that you have mastered them you are ready to apply them all and carry out an independent data analysis.
For your project, you firstly get one raw dataset, which you will turn into a dashboard, step by step. You will begin with a business question, and then touch upon different business domains, such as revenue management, planning, scheduling, management, investment, etc.
The progress of the project will be gradual – in the first weeks you will be guided by quizzes to make sure that you are on track. You will engage with creating first drafts of your work and discuss them with your peers.
In the final week, you will be in charge. You will get a second dataset and a number of questions to answer, and it is up to you to design and build the perfect dashboard.
This course will allow you to practice the skills you’ve gained in previous Data Analysis XSeries courses and prove you can be an indispensable asset in data-driven organizations.
By completing this project and EX101x and EX102x, you can obtain the XSeries Data Analysis Verified Certificate.

2.01x introduces principles of structural analysis and strength of materials in applications to three essential types of load-bearing elements: bars in axial loading, axisymmetric shafts in torsion, and symmetric beams in bending.
The course covers fundamental concepts of continuum mechanics, including internal resultants, displacement fields, stress, and strain.
While emphasizing analytical techniques, the course also provides an introduction to computing environments (MATLAB) and numerical methods (Finite Elements: Akselos)
This course is based on the first subject in solid mechanics for MIT Mechanical Engineering students. Join them and learn how to predict linear elastic behavior, and prevent structural failure, by relying on the notions of equilibrium, geometric compatibility, and constitutive material response.to calculate internal stress and strain fields in loaded structures

Whether you are an EU citizen or not, this course concerns you! The EU is a major global actor in the field of human rights. EU treaties state that human rights are a fundamental value of the Union, which must be a silver thread in all its policies. The EU now acts within an impressive array of competences, and therefore has the potential to impact – positively or negatively – anyone’s human rights.
This EU and Human Rights course teaches the basics of human rights, placing the EU at the centre of investigation. The course will examine a number of key questions:
What factors are key to making the EU a positive or a negative force for human rights? An example is the economic crisis: what impact has it had on people’s human rights in the EU and the world?
Which actors, friends or foes, must the EU engage with to successfully promote human rights? Examples include NGOs, businesses, or other international organisations like the Council of Europe or the United Nations.
In key policy sectors in which the EU is active, what is on balance the impact of the EU? Examples include trade, development, migration, social policy or international crisis management.
All of the course activities aim to improve your understanding of how the EU, alone or in combination with other local or global, state or non-state actors, can better promote and uphold human rights worldwide. The course is intended for anyone interested in human rights and the EU, human rights law, European law, European Studies, international relations, global governance, etc. It is divided into four modules:
The EU and Human Rights: Value Promotion and Coherence
Promoting Human Rights inside the EU
Promoting Human Rights in EU External Action
Capitalising on Success and Remedying Flaws
This course is taught by leading academics, and the content is illustrated through interviews of practitioners in the field of the EU and human rights. The course also comprises a wealth of bibliographical resources, and frequent exercises to test what you have learned.
This MOOC is based on the FRAME project (www.fp7-frame.eu), which has received funding from the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration. (Grant Agreement No. 320000)How the EU works

Since the introduction of mass production, the concept of “quality” has evolved from simple assembly line inspections to a broad approach to production and management involving an entire corporation. Quality has become a critical driver for long-term success through continuous process improvement and customer satisfaction. Quality Management today concerns the entire value chain, encompassing multi-tiered supplier networks and customer service and returns.
This business and management course balances the quantitative elements of quality engineering with a managerial approach to using quality in an organization to effect change. We cover the statistical basics needed for a Six-Sigma Green Belt certification, following the well-known process-improvement cycle: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control. The most important quality methods and techniques are taught, including sampling, statistical process control, process capability, regression analysis, and design of experiments. Quality management is examined, from the viewpoint of quality incorporated into product design, measuring and controlling quality in production and improving quality, using interactive, guided projects and case studies. The course closes with the presentation of a full Six-Sigma project.
The contents of this course are essentially the same as those of the corresponding TUM class (Quality Engineering and Management) and will enable you to immediately understand and apply quality concepts in your work and research.
WHY TAKE THIS COURSE?
Quality issues appear everywhere and affect the entire organisation.
You'll quickly master quality concepts so that you can apply quality tools and drive quality programs within your own organisation.
You'll gain the fundamentals for a Six-Sigma Green Belt in a manageable and positive learning environment, along with the chance to discuss with staff and fellow learners worldwide.The fundamentals for quality engineering and management

Las Asociaciones Público Privadas (APPs) se han convertido en un instrumento esencial para el crecimiento productivo, económico y social de los países de América Latina y el Caribe. Al desarrollar e implementar las APPs, se han observado restricciones en las capacidades técnicas en los responsables, particularmente en el sector público.
Para cubrir este vacío, IDBx ha desarrollado este curso, el primer MOOC disponible en español para aprender a planear, diseñar e implementar APPs para proyectos de desarrollo en América Latina y el Caribe.
Este curso busca compartir las experiencias de instituciones internacionales líderes con el fin de ayudar a cerrar brechas de conocimiento en la utilización efectiva de APPs, proporcionando ideas, soluciones y lecciones aprendidas para hacer frente a los retos o restricciones en capacidades técnicas y administrativas en el sector público de la Región. Las lecciones contenidas en el MOOC son aplicables a diferentes sectores como infraestructura, salud, educación, banda ancha, y sector fiscal, y toma en consideración los contextos nacionales de varios países de la región, incluyendo Perú, México, Colombia y Brasil.
Para tal efecto, el curso pone a disposición de los participantes lecturas seleccionadas, videos, casos de análisis y otros recursos de aprendizaje.
El curso se basa en los contenidos de la Guía de Referencia sobre Asociaciones Público-Privadas (APPs) Versión 2.0., desarrollada y publicada en el 2014 por el BID, el Banco Mundial (WB) y el Banco Asiático de Desarrollo (ADB).
La preparación de este curso fue financiada por el Programa Especial para el Desarrollo Institucional (SPID) del Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo. Mayor información en la página web del SPID.  
Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) have become an essential instrument for productive, economic, and social growth in Latin American countries and the Caribbean. However, when developed and implemented, those responsible for PPPs' implementation have had limited technical capacity, particularly in the public sector.
In order to address this need, IDB has developed the first MOOC available in Spanish, to learn how to plan, design, and implement PPPs for development projects in Latin America and the Caribbean. 
This course seeks to share the experiences of leading international institutions to contribute to close the knowledge gaps for the effective use of PPPs, providing ideas, solutions, and lessons learned to face the challenges or limitations of technical and administrative capacity in the region's public sector. 
The lessons from this course are applicable to different sectors such as infrastructure, health, education, broad band, fiscal sector, and take into consideration national contexts from various countries in the region, including Perú, México, Colombia and Brasil.
The course is based on the Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) Reference Guide Version 2.0, developed and published in 2014 by the IDB, World Bank (WB) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).
The preparation of this course was financed by the Special Program for Institutional Development (SPID) of the Inter-American Development Bank. For more information visit the SPID website.  Los principios y conceptos de qué es una APP cuándo y cómo se puede utilizar

This history course delves into the medieval history of the city of Burgos, from its inception in 884 c.e. as the homeland of the Spanish Kingdom of Castile and Leon, until the completion of the Spanish Reconquista in 1492. We will study complicated legendary heroes like Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, “The Cid”, both a champion of the Christian Reconquista and a friend of Islamic rulers, who lays buried in the Cathedral of Burgos. Like the Cid, medieval Burgos presented two competing views for Spain’s future – one centered on overt Castilian supremacy and another more nuanced one that incorporated religious minorities, especially Jews and Jewish converts to Christianity (conversos), into every element of political, economic, and even religious life.
This course will investigate the disastrous impact of the Plague and how it led to the death of King Alfonso XI and the ruinous civil war between the half-brothers, Pedro “The Cruel” and Enrique II of Trastamára. We will also appraise the collapse of the kingdom’s “Old Christian” nobility and the generation of new elite clans, some of whom hailed from Jewish ancestries. It was also the era of anti-Jewish pogroms, Christian fixations on “blood purity” and unsuccessful pleas for Christian harmony, and the last gasps of Jewish, Christian, and Muslim coexistence.
We will virtually-tour the Cathedral of Burgos, the Museum of Burgos, and what remains of the city’s medieval neighborhoods and structures. We will also study and transcribe intriguing vellum and paper manuscripts from the cathedral and municipal archives so that we discover new facets of this history.
No knowledge of Spanish is needed to participate in the course or in our transcription efforts.Garner knowledge and assess the history of medieval Spanish intercultural coexistence in the city of Burgos and the Kingdom of Castile and Leon

We make ethical or behaviour guiding right / wrong judgments all the time but have you ever wondered where Ethics comes from, what it is about and why it is important? This course provides an introduction to traditional Chinese ethical thought and focuses on the pervasive contrast in the way Chinese and Westerners think about ethical guidance or guidance concerning what is right and what is wrong, good or bad.  Traditional Western orthodoxy uses the metaphor of a law – in its most familiar popular form, the command of a supernatural being backed by a threat of eternal punishment or reward – to explain ethical guidance. The Classical Chinese philosophers by contrast were all naturalists. They talked about ethical guidance using a path metaphor – a natural dào.
We will look at two rival directions this natural dào model took in ancient China. The first direction views ethical paths as generated from human sources such as human history and past social practices. The other Confucian version views guidance as arising from a distinctly human guiding organ, something like a combination of our faculties of heart and mind. This organ issues the right/wrong or this/not-that judgements naturally. This internal map to moral choices branches, like a plant, as we mature. The alternative to human-based naturalism in China treated normative guidance as natural in a broader sense, such as the dào of water or one guided by what is beneficial vs harmful. Finally, we will take a brief look at a development after the classical period that resulted from the invasion of the more super-naturalist, Indo-European way of thinking about guidance – Medieval Chinese Buddhism.
Although Chinese concepts will be the focus of our discussion, all the content of this course is intended to be accessible to beginner students. For those who are beginners in Philosophy, we will include a brief introduction to the ideas of logic that further shape the Western metaphor of a law and help us understand its role in Western ethics, science and psychology so you can better understand the different ways these two philosophical metaphors explain where norms of behaviour come from, what they are about and why they are important.Describe various conceptions of the relation between humanity and nature presented in classical Chinese philosophical thought

Humanity faces an immense challenge: providing abundant energy to everyone without wrecking the planet. If we want a high-energy future while protecting the natural world for our children, we must consider the environmental consequences of energy production and use. But money matters too: energy solutions that ignore economic costs are not realistic—particularly in a world where billions of people currently can’t afford access to basic energy services. How can we proceed?
Energy Within Environmental Constraints won’t give you the answer. Instead, we will teach you how to ask the right questions and estimate the consequences of different choices.
This course is intended for a diverse audience. Whether you are a student, an activist, a policymaker, a business owner, or a concerned citizen, this course will help you start to think carefully about our current energy system and how we can improve its environmental performance.
This course:
Covers engineering, environmental science, and economics to enable critical, quantitative thinking about our energy system
Focuses on a working understanding of energy technologies, rich in details of real devices and light on theory; you won’t find any electrodynamics here but will find enough about modern commercial solar panels to estimate if they would be profitable to install in a given location
Covers environmental impacts of the energy system, focusing on air pollution, climate change, and land use
Emphasizes costs: the cascade of capital and operating costs from energy extraction all the way through end uses
Emphasizes quantitative comparisons and tradeoffs: how much more expensive is electricity from solar panels than from coal plants, and how much pollution does it prevent?  Is solar power as cost-effective an environmental investment as nuclear power or energy efficiency?  And how do we include considerations other than cost?
Please note that this is an abridged course, equivalent to roughly half of a full semester-long undergraduate course.  See the syllabus for topics that we include and a list of some we exclude.

¿Qué se entiende por gestión para resultados en el desarrollo?
¿Cuáles son los componentes del ciclo de gestión pública que aborda la gestión para resultados en el desarrollo?
¿Cuáles son los principales desafíos en América Latina y el Caribe para la implementación de la gestión para resultados en el desarrollo?
¿Cómo favorecer la implementación de la gestión para resultados en el desarrollo en América Latina y el Caribe?
Este curso – el primero de una serie de cursos sobre este tema - da respuesta a las anteriores preguntas y, a modo de introducción, brinda el marco conceptual de la gestión para resultados en el desarrollo con énfasis en los gobiernos subnacionales. En los siguientes cursos de esta serie profundizaremos en cada uno de los componentes del ciclo de gestión pública.
Los países de América Latina y el Caribe enfrentan considerables desafíos de la gestión pública, tales como el diseño de políticas públicas que tengan en consideración los puntos de vista de los diferentes actores; las demandas ciudadanas y los escasos recursos disponibles; la asignación de los recursos financieros; la calidad de los servicios públicos o el seguimiento y la evaluación de la gestión, entre otros.
La gestión para resultados en el desarrollo y su enfoque de gerencia contribuyen al abordaje de estos desafíos mediante el tratamiento integral de las distintas etapas del ciclo de la gestión pública, el uso de la información para la toma de decisiones y el empleo de múltiples instrumentos y metodologías.

In the following courses of this series we will go in depth in each one of the components of the public management cycle.
Latin American and Caribbean countries face considerable challenges in public management, such as the design of public policies that take into account different stakeholders’ points of view; citizen demands and scarce available resources; financial resource allocation; public service quality; and monitoring and evaluation; among others.
Managing for development results and its managerial focus contributes to addressing these challenges through a comprehensive effort involving different stages of the public management cycle, the use of information for decision-making, and the use of multiple instruments and methodologies.

This literature course will explore Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley’s 1818 horror classic, Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus. This novel is remarkable for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that Shelley wrote the novel when she was only 18 years old.

Frankenstein is a representation of both the Gothic and Romantic movements, and is often considered to be one of the earliest novels of science fiction as well. This story has had a huge influence on literature and popular culture, and has generated many adaptations in the forms of movies and plays.  The first film adaptation, in fact, appeared in 1910.

Participants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion. Course materials will include background information for understanding the text, as well as vocabulary and language support. Assessment will include quizzes and short writing assignments.

FAQ
What software will be required for this course?
We will use Java Platform, Standard Edition Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Platform, Standard Edition Development Kit (JDK) to give the computer the capability to run java programs and use BlueJ as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for developing Java programs.
Which version of Java will be used in this course?
The course is based on Java Version 7. It is fine that if you would like to use Java Version 8, but the new features introduced in Version 8 will not be covered by this course.
What are the system requirements for MS Windows users?
Java Version 7 and BlueJ are supported by MS Windows XP or above (except Windows RT). Java Platform, Standard Edition Runtime Environment (JRE) will need to be installed on the system. You will also need Internet Explorer 8+ or Firefox 3.6+ or Google Chrome to access the demonstration programs on the course web site. Documentation on the setup details can be found in the course handout to be given in week 1.
What are the system requirements for Mac users?
Java Version 7 and BlueJ are supported by Mac OS X 10.7.3 (Lion) or above. Java Platform, Standard Edition Runtime Environment (JRE) will need to be installed on the system. You will also need Safari 5.1.3+ or Firefox 3.6+ (64-bit) to access the demonstration programs on the course web site. Google Chrome is not supported. Documentation on the setup details can be found in the course handout to be given in week 1.
What are the system requirements for Linux users?
Java Version 7 and BlueJ are supported by Ubuntu/Debian Linux. OpenJDK, an implementation of the Java Platform, Standard Edition Development Kit (JDK), will need to be installed on the system. You will also need Firefox 3.6+ to access the demonstration programs on the course web site. Documentation on the setup details can be found in the course handout to be given in week 1.
Can I use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) other than BlueJ?
In this course, we would recommend BlueJ to beginning programmers as it is compact and provides just enough features for learning programming. Most of the programming examples in this course assume using BlueJ. However, you may use other professional IDEs such as Eclipse and NetBeans according to your own preference.
Will I be required to view Java Applets for learning the course materials?
There will be some demonstration programs shown as Java Applets in this course. However, these applets will only act as supplementary materials. Inaccessible to the applets would not affect the learning of the course materials. To access the applets, you will have to enable or activate Java plug-in on the browser. The plug-in requires 32-bit version of Java Platform, Standard Edition Runtime Environment (JRE) on MS Windows, 64-bit version of JRE on Mac OS X or 32/64-bit version of OpenJDK on Linux depending on the architecture of the system.Take a “real-life” problem and abstract out&amp;nbsp;the pertinent aspects necessary to solve it in an algorithmic manner.

The cell is a powerful case study to help us explore the functional logic of living systems. All organisms, from single-celled algae to complex multicellular organisms like us, are made up of cells. In this course, you will learn the how and why of biology by exploring the function of the molecular components of cells, and how these cellular components are organized in a complex hierarchy.
This course is designed to explore the fundamentals of cell biology. The overarching goal is for learners to understand, from a human-centered perspective, that cells are evolving ensembles of macromolecules that in turn form complex communities in tissues, organs, and multicellular organisms.
We will focus, in particular, on the mitochondrion, the organelle that powers the cell. In this context, we will look at the processes of cell metabolism. Finally, we will examine the F1F0 ATP synthase, the molecular machine that is responsible for the synthesis of most of the ATP that your cells require to do work. To underscore the importance of cell biology to our lives, we will address questions of development and disease and implications of science in society.
By the end of four weeks, we hope learners will have a deep intuition for the functional logic of a cell. Together we will ask how do things work within a cell, why do they work the way they do, and how are we impacted?
Join us as we explore the extraordinary and wonderfully dynamic world of the cell.

Ethical leadership is the critical appropriation and embodiment of traditions that have shaped the character and shared meanings of a people. Ethical leaders, therefore, are leaders whose characters have been shaped by the wisdom, habits and practices of particular traditions, often more than one, yet they tend be identified with a particular cultural ethos and narrative. Finally, ethical leadership asks the question of values in reference to ultimate concern.
Course participants will engage with the course in a number of ways including the development of an Ethical Leadership Toolkit (ELT). The ELT is an instrument for leaders who engage the complex ethical questions in public space and includes the following: Ethical Leadership Model; Ethical Decision-Making Model; Ways of Doing Ethics; Remembering, Retelling and Reliving Stories; and Looking, Listening and Learning. Participants will be invited to develop their own Ethical Leadership Toolkit through video exercises led by Professor Fluker, survey questions, discussion forums, journaling and assessments.
Students who pass this course are eligible to take a 6 week online addendum course and receive graduate credits as a non-matriculating student from Boston University. The addendum course will go deeper into the MOOC material with discussion, readings and written assignments.

Banking and financial markets encompass the ‘ecosystem’ that (a) channelizes money from those who have it (i.e., savers/investors) to those who need it (i.e., borrowers) and (b) facilitate cross-border flow of funds through exchange of currencies. That ecosystem of banks and financial markets (including Central Banks) has deepened in size, sophistication and complexity over the years. However, in recent times they have also been the subject of abuse, failures and economic distress in several countries resulting in a ‘contagion’ that has concurrently impacted several countries around the World! 
More recently, and perhaps more importantly, thanks to the liberalization of most economies, the world has witnessed an exponential increase in the free flow of capital across countries. Banking institutions and financial markets, being the predominant conduit for such free flow of capital across countries, have therefore become even more ‘globally interconnected’. Such a globally interconnected financial system, combined with regulatory systems that are country-specific and hence varying considerably in rigor and implementation, has further compounded the risks and the consequent contagion, as witnessed in the global financial meltdown that was triggered in 2008.
This course titled “Introduction to Banking and Financial Markets” will be delivered in two parts. The first part will help you demystify the role of banking and financial markets in any country, the products and services they offer and the underlying market mechanisms.
The second part of the course will examine the risks embedded in banking and financial markets, how these risks have been heightened because of a globally interconnected world and the regulatory and governance mechanisms to minimize adverse outcomes in such a complex system.The theory and concepts underlying banking and financial markets and the ‘symbiotic’ relationship between the two
The products and instruments that are offered by banks and financial Markets to meet the financial needs of individuals, businesses and governments
How and why are they different from corporations that sell goods and services

Supply chains, especially global supply chains, are complex structures that involve several businesses crossing multiple time zones and continents. The design of a supply chain is critical to its overall success, and ultimately, the firm’s success. This business and management course will cover all aspects of supply chain design.
We will start with learning how to design for the flow of physical products or goods. Variously referred to as Network Design, Facility Location, or Flow Optimization, the physical design is a core requirement for any supply chain planner.
Following this, we will dive into the design of the financial flows involved with supply chains. Specifically, you will learn how to translate supply chain terms and metrics into financial terms used in the C-suite.
We will then proceed into the design and management of the information flow of a supply chain by examining three critical phases: procurement, production, and demand planning. Our primary objective here is to understand how a business works with different partners in these three basic supply chain activities.
The procurement lessons will cover basic approaches as well as more advanced techniques such as combinatorial auctions and supply contracts. The production lessons will concentrate on material resource planning (MRP) and fixed horizon planning. The demand management lessons will examine collaboration as well as sales and operations planning (S&amp;OP). After covering the design of the three flows (physical, financial, and information), we will turn to the design of the supply chain organization itself as well as the metrics. Real cases and examples from practice will be used throughout the entire course.
This course is part of the MITx MicroMasters Credential in Supply Chain Management that is specifically designed to teach the critical skills needed to be successful in this exciting field. In order to qualify for the MicroMasters Credential you will need to earn a Verified Certificate in each of the five courses as well as pass a Capstone Exam. When you sign up for a CTL.SC2x Verified Certificate you will also be granted access to supplemental content such as additional practice problems and complementary videos.

New week 6 content has been added in the fourth iteration of this popular course!
Join the Smithsonian, and comic book industry legend Stan Lee, to explore the history of the comic book and the rise of superheroes.
The ancient gods of Egyptian, Greek and Roman myths still exist, but today, they have superpowers, human foibles and secret identities. They come from comic books and graphic novels, and have taken over pop culture on the stage, screen, video games, and animation.
 
From Superman® and Spider-Man®, to The Avengers® and The Hulk® and beyond, who are these heroes? And, how have they evolved from folklore and myth, across all cultures and religions?
 
Learn from Smithsonian and industry experts including:
Stan Lee, who was one of the creators of the modern superhero template. His early comics featuring Spider-Man, Iron Man®, The Hulk, Thor®, and The Avengers led Marvel to success. He continues to reinvent himself to create modern global superheroes and appear in cameos in superhero films and TV, such as Avengers: Age of Ultron.
Michael Uslan, executive producer of top grossing, award winning movies, including The Dark Knight series, Lego® Movie, the animated Batman films and Batman® VS Superman. 
In this course, we explore the following questions:
Why did superheroes first arise in 1938 and experience what we refer to as their “Golden Age” during World War II?
Why did the superhero genre ebb and flow in popularity over the decades?
How have comic books, published weekly since the mid-1930’s, mirrored a changing American society, reflecting our mores, slang, fads, biases and prejudices? 
Why was the comic book industry nearly shut down in the McCarthy Era of the 1950’s? 
How did our superheroes become super-villains in the eyes of the government, clergy, educators, and parents of the mid-20th Century? 
When and how did comic books become acceptable again, and eventually become valid teaching tools in universities and schools? 
When and how did comic book artwork become accepted as a true American art form as indigenous to this country as jazz? 
Finally, when and how did comic books become “cool” and the basis for blockbuster movies, hit TV series, top-selling video games, and acclaimed animation, while also impacting fashion and style- and even the moral and ethical codes of children- around the globe?
For the first time ever, the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History is excited to offer the opportunity to go into the collection and see why superheroes are a dominant cultural force in today’s world.
As you learn about how cultural myths, world events, and personal experiences shaped the first superheroes, you will apply these frameworks to create your own superhero– or you can choose to do a deeper analysis on existing comic book heroes. This original project is required for certification and anything created by you as part of the course is the intellectual property of you and you alone.  At the end of the course, you will have the opportunity to take your final project work and participate with other current and alumni students in a two week “team track add-on" to the course. 
At last, fans, students and seekers of knowledge have the opportunity to enroll in the ultimate comic book course.The history and origins of the first superheroes and comic books, and how they changed over time
The evolution of American society from the Depression to today, as viewed through the lens of the comic book genre
How the current globalization and diversity of the next generation of superheroes impacts our storytelling across all mediums
How to apply historical examples to create superheroes for the present day

How healthy is the state of the economy? How can economic policy help support or restore health to the economy? These questions are at the heart of financial programming. In our FPP courses you will learn the building blocks of how to answer to these questions.
Financial programming is a framework to analyze the current state of the economy, forecast where the economy is headed, and identify economic policies that can change the course of the economy.
In Part 1 of the FPP sequence, presented by IMF's Institute for Capacity Development, you will learn the basic skills required to conduct financial programming. The course presents the principal features of the four main sectors that comprise the macroeconomy (real, fiscal, external, and monetary); demonstrates how to read, interpret, and analyze the accounts for these sectors; and illustrates how these sectors are interlinked. (Part 2 of the FPP sequence will cover preparation of a baseline forecast and design of an adjustment program.)
During the course, economists from the IMF will lead you through the accounts and analysis of an economy. Besides engaging with lecture videos, you will answer questions on the concepts explained, solve short numerical exercises, discuss with fellow participants economic developments in your country, and work with data for a hypothetical country. The reading material will be provided to you.
Whether you are a civil servant working on economic issues for your country, a professional working with economic data, or simply interested in better understanding the developments of an economy, this course will provide hands-on training on macroeconomic analysis. We hope that you will join us in this exciting journey!

Examine how architecture reflects Japan’s history, starting with its emergence as a new nation in the 19th century and the building of the Western-style capital city of Tokyo on the foundations of Edo. New building materials and construction methods reflected changing times, and the radical contrast between tradition and modernism in the nation was clearly visible in architecture throughout Japan.
After exploring the intense Westernization Japan experienced to rival the world’s developed countries, we will turn to look at how Japanese architects developed their own version of Modernism. Initially, Japanese wanted to pursue the discoveries of the Franco-Swiss Le Corbusier and of Walter Gropius at the German Bauhaus. But soon, Japan also began to produce its own 20th-century architects and develop its own style. Following World War II, Kenzo Tange became the first Japanese architect in history to achieve international fame.
Lastly, we will mount an interview-based case study titled “Exploring Tokyo Tech’s Twenty-First Century O-okayama Campus.” Tokyo Institute of Technology (aka Tokyo Tech) possesses its own unique and unbroken succession of architects and a campus consisting of their buildings. We will learn about Kazuo Shinohara, one of the most prominent Japanese designers of the second half of the 20th century, and several of his renowned disciples from Tokyo Tech.
This course aims to illustrate the present state of Japanese Modernist and postmodern building, as well as the distance covered over the past 150 years, including the 130-year history of Tokyo Tech itself. Join us on this journey through time as we examine and admire Japan’s architecture to better understand Japanese history. How and why today’s Japanese architecture differs from the West

Podemos afirmar sin temor a equivocarnos que un buen curso de Cálculo amplía la visión del estudiante en su campo y en su área de estudio, que no pertenece necesariamente al área de física o matemática, por ejemplo en fisiología para estudiantes de medicina.
El Cálculo Diferencial es el lenguaje en el que algunas leyes de la naturaleza se expresan, por ejemplo: nos permite describir el movimiento y el cálculo de trayectorias en dinámica, nos ayuda a resolver problemas de áreas y volúmenes, a resolver problemas extremales en campos como economía y matemática financiera.
En este curso se presentan los conceptos y demostraciones con extrema precisión y cuidado; se hace énfasis en los fundamentos del Cálculo para que lo que se enseña quede fundamentado y claramente explicado.
Se estudia el cálculo diferencial de funciones de variable real, por lo tanto, se parte de una estructura algebraica de los números reales. Utiliza conceptos puramente métricos, por eso se introduce el concepto de distancia para explicar que nos vamos acercando a algo, es decir, se define la estructura del espacio métrico  que da paso al primer tema sucesiones de números reales continúa con sucesiones convergentes, derivadas de una función hasta llegar a problemas extremales en dos variables y multiplicadores de Lagrange.
Esperamos que este curso de Cálculo logre cambiar la percepción de los estudiantes en cuanto a su aplicación e importancia. </description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>728</course_id><title>Agua en América Latina: Abundancia en medio de la escasez mundial</title><published_date>2016-03-14T17:42:15-04:00</published_date><course_length>10 semanas</course_length><effort>6-7 horas por semana</effort><subject>Environmental Studies</subject><price>FREE

This literature course will explore in depth Mark Twain’s 1884  novel, Huckleberry Finn, which has an important place in American literature and history. This novel is among the first in major American literature to be written in dialect, characterized by regional Southern English. While this makes the writing difficult to understand at first, it also gives us a window into the language of the time.

The story is noted for its colorful descriptions of people and places along the Mississippi River. Set in the American South after the Civil War, this book features a society that has ceased to exist about twenty years prior. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is often described as a satire on deep-rooted attitudes, particularly racism, in the South.
 
Participants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion. Course materials will include background information for understanding the text, as well as vocabulary and language support. Assessment will include quizzes and short writing assignments.

This physics course introduces the concept of tensor product states to discuss entanglement and Bell inequalities. You will learn about angular momentum and its representations. This is used to understand the spectrum of central potentials and to introduce hidden symmetries. Lastly, you will learn about the addition of angular momentum and an algebraic approach to the hydrogen atom spectrum.
This is the last of three courses offering a sophisticated view of quantum mechanics and its proper mathematical foundation.
Part 1: Wave Mechanics
Part 2: Quantum Dynamics
Part 3: Entanglement and Angular Momentum
To follow this course you should have taken Part 1: Wave Mechanics, and Part 2: Quantum Dynamics.
Completing the 3-part Quantum Mechanics series will give you the necessary foundation to pursue advanced study or research at the graduate level in areas related to quantum mechanics
The series will follow MIT’s on campus 8.05, the second semester of the three-course sequence on undergraduate quantum mechanics, and will be equally rigorous. 8.05 is a signature course in MIT's physics program and a keystone in the education of physics majors. 
Learner Testimonials
“I’ve thought long and hard to come up with a better MOOC than this one (I’ve completed 25 of these things over the past 2 years) and can’t do it. 8.05x is #1 and I suspect will stay that way for some time to come.”
 “Being an engineering student from India trying to shift to Physics, I am often faced with the requirement to study topics on my own. Very often this has led me to feel inadequate. 8.05x was the perfect opportunity for me to both gain knowledge and evaluate my understanding on a high quality international platform. It has really exceeded my expectations. Now, at the end of fifteen weeks, I feel more confident and hopefully I am more knowledgeable.”

This literature and theater course will delve into two wonderful plays of young love, Romeo and Juliet and A Midsummer Night's Dream, and try to bring alive what makes them so compelling and popular -- as both literature and drama.
As we explore the genius of the plays on the page, we will also study the lives of the plays in performance, from Shakespeare's own theatre to the stages and screens across the globe today. To help us further, actors will occasionally join our effort to demonstrate ways of bringing the text alive as living theatre.A new appreciation for Shakespeare's greatness and popularity, on the page and in performance across the globe.
How to combine literary and historical analysis with theatrical approaches to bring Shakespeare alive.
New ways of understanding Shakespeare's continuing relevance to us today as we explore recurring themes in plays that trace the arc of Shakespeare's career.

Acerca de este curso
Dentro de la práctica educativa y clínica, las neurociencias y la psicología cognitiva son ejes fundamentales en la comprensión del comportamiento humano. Estas disciplinas aportan no solo modelos explicativos desde las ciencias básicas sino también desde su perspectiva aplicada. Teniendo en cuenta lo anterior, se pretende generar un espacio para comprender cómo el ser humano desarrolla y adquiere las habilidades de lectura y escritura así como las dificultades más comunes en su adquisición, desde una perspectiva neuropsicológica y cognitiva. Esto, con el fin de ofrecer pautas para identificar cuándo un niño presenta alguna o varias de estas dificultades y qué hacer para ayudarlo en su correcta apropiación.Reconocer las implicaciones en la adquisición del proceso de la lecto-escritura en la etapa escolar, desde una aproximación neuropsicológica.</description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>738</course_id><title>Mobile Application Experiences Part 4: Understanding Use</title><published_date>2016-01-08T10:42:58-05:00</published_date><course_length>4 weeks</course_length><effort>10-12 hours/week</effort><subject>Computer Science</subject><price>FREE

Phenomena as diverse as the motion of the planets, the spread of a disease, and the oscillations of a suspension bridge are governed by differential equations. This course is an introduction to the mathematical theory of ordinary differential equations and follows a modern dynamical systems approach. In particular, equations are analyzed using qualitative, numerical, and if possible, symbolic techniques.
MATH226 is essentially the edX equivalent of MA226; a one-semester course in ordinary differential equations taken by more than 500 students per year at Boston University. It is divided into three parts. MATH226.2x is the second part.

Should we clone humans? What should we think of the coming genetic revolution? How much control should we have over how and when we die? When does medical treatment turn into medical enhancement — and should we care? Is rationing health care good, bad, necessary — or all of the above?
This course will explore fundamental moral issues that arise in medicine, health, and biotechnology. Get behind the headlines — and polarized debates — and join others who want to think deeply and openly about these problems. Some are as old as life itself: the vulnerability of illness, the fact of death. Some are new, brought on by a dizzying pace of technology that can unsettle our core ideas about human nature and our place in the world. And nearly all intersect with issues of racial and gender equality, as well as policies affecting the world’s most vulnerable populations.
Designed to introduce students to the range of issues that define bioethics, together with core concepts and skills, this course should be of interest to undergraduates, health care professionals, policy makers, and anyone interested in philosophy or ethics.
Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs. Learn more.Recognize core philosophy concepts in bioethics debates, including well-being, justice, and autonomy
Develop scientific literacy relevant to core bioethics topics such as abortion, genetic enhancement, and euthanasia

Chemistry and biology are traditionally taught as separate subjects at the high school level, where students memorize fundamental scientific principles that are universally accepted. However, at the university level and in industry, we learn that science is not as simple as we once thought. We are constantly confronted by questions about the unknown and required to use creative, integrated approaches to solve these problems. By bringing together knowledge from multidisciplinary fields, we are empowered with the ability to generate new ideas. The goal of this course is to develop skills for generating new ideas at the interface between chemistry and biology by analyzing pioneering studies.
When should I register?
Registration will be open throughout the course. However, if a learner wants to receive a certificate, he/she should register by the end of April.How to generate ideas for research and business

In the last decade, the amount of data available to organizations has reached unprecedented levels. Data is transforming business, social interactions, and the future of our society. In this course, you will learn how to use data and analytics to give an edge to your career and your life. We will examine real world examples of how analytics have been used to significantly improve a business or industry. These examples include Moneyball, eHarmony, the Framingham Heart Study, Twitter, IBM Watson, and Netflix. Through these examples and many more, we will teach you the following analytics methods: linear regression, logistic regression, trees, text analytics, clustering, visualization, and optimization. We will be using the statistical software R to build models and work with data. The contents of this course are essentially the same as those of the corresponding MIT class (The Analytics Edge). It is a challenging class, but it will enable you to apply analytics to real-world applications. 
The class will consist of lecture videos, which are broken into small pieces, usually between 4 and 8 minutes each. After each lecture piece, we will ask you a “quick question” to assess your understanding of the material. There will also be a recitation, in which one of the teaching assistants will go over the methods introduced with a new example and data set. Each week will have a homework assignment that involves working in R or LibreOffice with various data sets. (R is a free statistical and computing software environment we’ll use in the course. See the Software FAQ below for more info). In the middle of the class, we will run an analytics competition, and at the end of the class there will be a final exam, which will be similar to the homework assignments.
  FAQ
What do I need to know about the topic prior to enrolling in the course?
You only need to know basic mathematics. For most people, this is equivalent to basic high school mathematics. You should know concepts like mean, standard deviation, and histograms. This course is also useful for those who already have experience in the subject.  In each lecture, recitation, and homework assignment, we use a different dataset and case to illustrate the method. Even if you are familiar with all of the methods taught, you can still learn a lot from the different examples.
What software will be used in the course?
We’ll be using two software programs in this class: R and LibreOffice. Both are free online, and you don’t need to be familiar with either of them to take the course. R is a free statistical and computing software environment and LibreOffice is similar to MS Office but a free open source program. Specifically we’ll use the LibreOffice module, Calc in this course. Don’t worry though - we’ll teach everything from scratch!An applied understanding of many different analytics methods, including linear regression, logistic regression, CART, clustering, and data visualization

There is no doubt that technological innovation is one of the key elements driving human progress. However, new technologies raise ethical questions, have serious implications for society and the environment and pose new risks, often unknown and unknowable before the new technologies reach maturity.
For example, how can we make sure that “smart cities” and other data-based services strike a balance between the benefits the service provides and the risks it poses to the security of citizens? What are the ethical questions surrounding self-driving vehicles or autonomous weapons? What are the health risks of nanotechnologies? All these create new risks and raise serious ethical questions. The challenge is to innovate in a way that benefits both companies and society – to innovate responsibly.
This course provides both a theoretical and practical framework for assessing and designing responsible innovations, combined with real-world examples. The first part (weeks 1 and 2) of the course focuses on ethical questions and concerns, such as: a fair distribution of costs and benefits, moral obligations and individual and collective responsibilities. The second part (weeks 3 and 4) deals with (unknown) risks and safety of new technologies including a number of qualitative and quantitative risk assessment methods. The last part of the course (weeks 5, 6 and 7) is about the management of responsible innovations and evolving a new, value driven, design process.
Case studies during the course include nanotechnology, self-driving vehicles, smart meters for electricity, autonomous weapons, nuclear energy and CO2capture and storage together with their related ethical and safety concerns.  Affordable innovations for low-income groups and emerging markets are also covered in the course.
The course includes a free e-book.
The course will be of benefit to innovation and risk managers, entrepreneurs, policy analysts, engineers, designers and strategic advisors who are looking for a methodical approach with which to judge responsible innovations.

This literature course, the sixth module in the Poetry in America series, explores a diverse array of American Modernist poets and poems.  While “Modernism” is notoriously difficult to define, the movement spanned the decades from the 1910s to the mid-1940s, and the poetry of this period marked a clear break from past traditions and past forms.  
Throughout this module, we will encounter such poets as Robert Frost, T.S. Eliot, Marianne Moore, Langston Hughes, William Carlos Williams, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Claude McKay, Dorothy Parker, and Wallace Stevens. We will study how these poets employed the language of rejection and revolution, of making and remaking, of artistic appropriation and cultural emancipation. Traveling to the homes and workplaces of Robert Frost and Wallace Stevens; to the Poetry Foundation in Chicago, where the institution of American Modernism was born; and even exploring the River Thames in the London of Eliot's THE WASTE LAND, we will see the sites that witnessed—and cultivated—the rise of American Modernism.  
Led by Harvard Professor Elisa New, the Poetry in America series surveys nearly 400 years of American poetry. Through video lectures, archival images and texts, expeditions to historic sites, interpretive seminars with large and small groups, interviews with poets and scholars, and conversations about poems with distinguished Americans, Poetry in America takes learners on a journey through the literature of a nation. Along the way, distinguished guests including Elena Kagan, Henry Louis Gates, Eve Ensler, John McCain, Andrea Mitchell, Michael Pollan, Drew Faust, Tony Kushner, and Nas, among others, bring fresh perspectives to the study of American poetry.Best practices for reading, analyzing, and discussing poems and other texts

1865-1890: The Unfinished Revolution, examines the pivotal but misunderstood era of Reconstruction that followed the Civil War, the first effort in American history to construct an interracial democracy. Beginning with a discussion of the dramatic change in historians’ interpretations of the period in the last two generations, the course goes on to discuss how Reconstruction turned on issues of continued relevance today. Among these are: who is an American citizen and what are citizens’ rights; what is the relationship between political and economic freedom; which has the primary responsibility for protecting Americans’ rights – the federal or state governments; and how should public authorities respond to episodes of terrorism? The course explores the rewriting of the laws and Constitution to incorporate the principle of equality regardless of race; the accomplishments and failings of Reconstruction governments in the South; the reasons for violent opposition in the South and for the northern retreat from Reconstruction; and the consolidation at the end of the nineteenth century of a new system of white supremacy.
This course is part of the XSeries, Civil War and Reconstruction, which introduces students to the most pivotal era in American history. The Civil War transformed the nation by eliminating the threat of secession and destroying the institution of slavery. It raised questions that remain central to our understanding of ourselves as a people and a nation – the balance of power between local and national authority, the boundaries of citizenship, and the meanings of freedom and equality. The XSeries will examine the causes of the war, the road to secession, the conduct of the Civil War, the coming of emancipation, and the struggle after the war to breathe meaning into the promise of freedom for four million emancipated slaves. One theme throughout the XSeries is what might be called the politics of history – how the world in which a historian lives affects his or her view of the past, and how historical interpretations reinforce or challenge the social order of the present.The dramatic change in historians’ interpretations of the period in the last two generations
How Reconstruction turned on issues of continued relevance today, such as:
Who is an American citizen and what are citizens’ rights?

This short course teaches students and industry professionals how to design integrated optical devices and circuits, using a hands-on approach with commercial tools. We will fabricate your designs using a state-of-the-art ($5M) silicon photonic rapid-prototyping 100 keV electron-beam lithography facility. We will measure your designs using an automated optical probe station and provide you the data. You will then analyze your experimental data.
Why take this course?
To get hands on design experience with integrated optics
To learn how to use advanced optical design tools
To get your design fabricated, and obtain experimental data
The focus of this course is a design project, guided by lectures, tutorials and activities. As a first-time designer, you will design an interferometer, which is a widely used device in many applications such as communications (modulation, switching) and sensing. Specifically, it is Mach-Zehnder Interferometer, consisting of fibre grating couplers, two splitters, and optical waveguides. For advanced designers, this course is an opportunity to design many other devices, such as directional couplers, ring, racetrack and disk resonators, Bragg gratings including grating assisted contra-directional couplers, photonic crystals, multi-mode interference (MMI) couplers, polarization diversity components, mode-division multiplexing (MDM) components and circuits, novel waveguides such as sub-wavelength grating (SWG) and metamaterial waveguides, slot waveguides, etc.
Commercial software tool licenses are provided in this course (Lumerical Solutions, Mentor Graphics, and MATLAB). Open-source alternatives are provided. Mentor Graphics tools are accessed remotely via a cloud service; the others can be run on your own computer.
You will earn a professional certificate from the University of British Columbia and edX upon successful completion of this course. Certificates can be uploaded directly to your LinkedIn profile.
FAQ
How much effort is required?
Since this is a design-based course, students in previous courses have put in between 3-25 hours/week, depending on their background, interest, and the level of complexity of their chosen project. There are also many optional modules in the course, completing all the optional modules increases the time required.
What are the prerequisites for taking this course?
Phot1x is targeted at an audience with a wide range of backgrounds who are committed to learning the material and completing the course design project. The prerequisites are introductory physics, and optics, for example an undergraduate optics or electromagnetics course. Background in microwave/RF would be an asset. No background with integrated optics is assumed. The course uses various computer software, hence a background in basic computer programming is beneficial (e.g., MATLAB, Python).
Do I need to buy a textbook?
The notes, videos and exercises are all sufficient to complete this course. The textbook is optional. Included in the course are several key chapters from the book "Silicon Photonics Design", by Lukas Chrostowski and Michael Hochberg, published by Cambridge University Press. The full version (ebook or hardcopy) is available for purchase at www.cambridge.org/9781107085459.
What are the fabrication details? 
Your devices will be fabricated on a Silicon on insulator (SOI) wafer with 220 nm silicon thickness, with a minimum isolated feature size of 60 nm. Each participant is allocated 410 µm x 605 µm of space, enough for &gt;10 devices each (more available on request). One chip is being manufactured and measured for this course, and the measurement data will be provided to the course participants. 
Who will be doing the fabrication and measurements?
The fabrication will be performed by Richard Bojko, at the University of Washington, Nanofabrication Facility. The measurements will be performed by the team of Lukas Chrostowski, at The University of British Columbia.
Will I be getting a physical chip in the mail?
No. Only one chip is being manufactured for this course, and the measurements will be performed at UBC. The measurement data will be provided to the course participants.
Are there opportunities for fabrication beyond this course, including getting chips in the mail?
Yes. Either after, or during the course, you can purchase an entire chip. It will be sent to you directly. Optionally we can perform automated testing for you prior to sending it out. We typically do fabrication runs every two months. Additional options for  obtaining your own chips (EBeam or MPW foundries) will be discussed in the course.
Do you have any advanced silicon photonics courses, and what can I take after Phot1x?
Yes. We offer advanced courses on silicon photonics, including on-site hands-on workshops on Passive silicon photonics (ring resonators, grating couplers, Bragg gratings, etc); Active silicon photonics (modulators, detectors); CMOS electronics for photonics; and Systems, Integration and Packaging. All these workshops include fabrication via MPW foundries. More details can be found at http://siepic.ubc.ca. Phot1X is a good background course for the above workshops.Optical modelling tools

This course will examine Oscar Wilde’s only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray. This novel was first published as a serial novel in Lippincott’s Monthly Magazine in 1890.

The Picture of Dorian Gray was immediately controversial, and was censored by the magazine’s editors. Even with the censorship, reviewers still thought that Wilde ought to have been prosecuted for violating laws concerning public morality. This story has two important themes: the idea of selling one’s soul, and the theme of living a double life. Wilde takes these themes to their extreme.

Global Health is a new field within public health sciences that integrates the knowledge from fields such as epidemiology, medicine, economy and the behavioral sciences. The main aim of the course, An Introduction to Global Health, is to describe and analyze variation in health between and within countries. This will provide an understanding of causes of the variation. The course will include measurements and determinants of health. Further, the course offers a public health perspective of the global burden of diseases. The course will specifically address: Maternal and Child Health; Sexual reproductive health and rights; Major infectious disease - malaria, TB, HIV, pneumonia; Non communicable disease; Mental health; Disasters; Injuries; Health systems and financing; and Health policy. Analysis will be done from a gender and equity perspective.
The course combines different teaching methods: lectures, self-study, and exercises using gapminder tools (Gapminder.org) to analyze indicators. An added value is that the course is open to participants from different parts of the world, which creates an intercultural learning and teaching environment.
By the end of this course, you should have a good idea of how these key global health challenges are approached by different stakeholders. You will have developed an understanding of what kind of solutions exist today and hopefully you will be curious as to how to make positive difference in the world.How the countries of the world changed from being developing or developed countries to now being a on a continuum of socio-economic level

How did Newton describe the orbits of the planets? To do this, he created calculus.  But he used a different coordinate system more appropriate for planetary motion.  We will learn to shift our perspective to do calculus with parameterized curves and polar coordinates. And then we will dive deep into exploring the infinite to gain a deeper understanding and powerful descriptions of functions.
How does a computer make accurate computations? Absolute precision does not exist in the real world, and computers cannot handle infinitesimals or infinity. Fortunately, just as we approximate numbers using the decimal system, we can approximate functions using series of much simpler functions. These approximations provide a powerful framework for scientific computing and still give highly accurate results. They allow us to solve all sorts of engineering problems based on models of our world represented in the language of calculus.

Do you have an interest in biology and quantitative tools? Do you know computational methods but do not realize how they apply to biological problems? Do you know biology but do not understand how scientists really analyze complicated data? 7.QBWx: Quantitative Biology Workshop is designed to give students exposure to the application of quantitative tools to analyze biological data at an introductory level. For the last few years, the Biology Department of MIT has run this workshop-style course as part of a one-week outreach program for students from other universities. With 7.QBWx, we can give more students from around the world the chance to discover quantitative biology. We hope that this series of workshops encourages students to explore new interests and take more biology and computational courses.
We expect that students from 7.00x Introduction to Biology – The Secret of Life or an equivalent course can complete this workshop-based course without a background in programming. The course content will introduce programming languages but will not teach any one language in a comprehensive manner. The content of each week varies. We want learners to have an introduction to multiple languages and tools to find a topic that they would want to explore more. Participants with programming experience will find some weeks easier than students with only biology experience, while those with a biology background should find the week on genetics easier. We recommend that students try to complete each week to find what interests them the most.

This workshop includes activities on the following biological topics: population biology, biochemical equilibrium and kinetics, molecular modeling of enzymes, visual neuroscience, genetics, gene expression and development, and genomics. The tools and programming languages include MATLAB, PyMOL, StarGenetics, Python, and R. This course does not require learners to download MATLAB. All MATLAB activities run and are graded within the edX platform. We do recommend that participants download a few other free tools for the activities so that they learn how to use the same tools and programs that scientists use.

Poetry lives in any reader, not necessarily in performance by the poet or a trained actor. The pleasure of actually saying a poem, or even saying it in your imagination—your mind’s ear—is essential. That is a central idea of “The Art of Poetry,” well demonstrated by the videos at favoritepoem.org: the photographer saying Sylvia Plath’s “Nick and the Candlestick,” the high school student saying Langston Hughes’ “Minstrel Man.” Those readers base what they say about each poem upon their experience of saying it.
The course is demanding, and based on a certain kind of intense reading, requiring prolonged, thorough— in fact, repeated—attention to specific poems.
The focus will be on elements of the art such as poetry’s historical relation to courtship; techniques of sound in free verse; poetry and difficulty; kidding and tribute—with only incidental attention to “schools,” jargons, categories, and coteries.
Learners are encouraged to think truly, carefully and passionately about what the poem says, along with how the poem feels in one’s own, actual or imagined voice. As Robert Pinsky says, in the Preface to Singing School: “this anthology will succeed if it encourages the reader to emulate it by replacing it . . . create your own anthology.” In a comparable way, this course hopes to inspire a lifelong study of poetry.How to think about, read, listen to, and engage with poems

The goal of this course is to explore and develop plans of action for improving the job and career opportunities for today and tomorrow’s workforce. At this time, there aren’t enough good jobs or educational opportunities in the U.S. or globally to meet the aspirations and needs of all who want and need to work or to deliver on the expectation that every generation should achieve a higher standard of living for themselves and their families than their parent’s generation. This is a fundamental ideal that drives people all over the world. In the U.S. we call it the American Dream.
If we take the right actions we can shape the future of work in ways that meet the needs of workers, families, and their economies and societies. To do so we first have to understand how the world of work is changing, how firms can compete and prosper and support good jobs and careers, and how to update the policies and practices governing the world of work.
In this business and management course, we’ll start by tracing the history of work and employment that has made the economy work so well in the past. And we’ll uncover what’s gone wrong, in order to figure out new solutions that fit today’s workforce, economy, and society. We’ll also take you on a personal journey. You’ll learn what employers expect in today’s world of work – the skills, flexibility, and knowledge that are crucial for success in the contemporary workplace. We’ll examine what has to happen in order for employers, workers, governments, and regulators to come together to forge new policies, rules, and understandings for governing the world of work in the 21st century. We’ll make this all come alive by highlighting the experiences, contributions, and aspirations of real people who are working right now to address these challenges.
So join us, and let’s get started on shaping the future of work.A historical perspective and overview of work and employment policy in the United States and around the world
How the roles of firms, employees, and public policy have changed and created the labor market we see today
The status of the current labor market in more detail: What does it look like? What types of jobs do we have, and what skills are required? What are emerging trends in how firms organize work, and in the role of labor market institutions such as unions?

This physics course covers Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle and the concept of compatible operators. You will also learn about the Schrödinger and Heisenberg pictures of quantum mechanics and the coherent and squeezed states of the harmonic oscillator. The course concludes with two state systems and their applications to NMR and masers.
This is the second of three courses offering a sophisticated view of quantum mechanics and its proper mathematical foundation.
Part 1: Wave Mechanics
Part 2: Quantum Dynamics
Part 3: Entanglement and Angular Momentum
To understand the material in this course you should have taken Mastering Quantum Mechanics Part 1: Wave Mechanics.
Completing the 3-part Quantum Mechanics series will give you the necessary foundation to pursue advanced study or research at the graduate level in areas related to quantum mechanics
The series will follow MIT’s on campus 8.05, the second semester of the three-course sequence on undergraduate quantum mechanics, and will be equally rigorous. 8.05 is a signature course in MIT's physics program and a keystone in the education of physics majors. 
  Learner Testimonials
“I’ve thought long and hard to come up with a better MOOC than this one (I’ve completed 25 of these things over the past 2 years) and can’t do it. 8.05x is #1 and I suspect will stay that way for some time to come.”
 “Being an engineering student from India trying to shift to Physics, I am often faced with the requirement to study topics on my own. Very often this has led me to feel inadequate. 8.05x was the perfect opportunity for me to both gain knowledge and evaluate my understanding on a high quality international platform. It has really exceeded my expectations. Now, at the end of fifteen weeks, I feel more confident and hopefully I am more knowledgeable.”Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and compatible operators

The proliferation of consumer devices and ubiquitous information access is driving the enterprise away from a device-centric model centered on corporate-owned and provisioned devices to a bring-your-own-device (BYOD) model in which employees use their own devices to access corporate applications and data. Workers expect consistent access to corporate tools and data regardless of the type of device they’re using. They also want their corporate-issued technology and resources to look and behave like their personal technology—always on and always available from any device, from virtually anywhere.
An enterprise model that supports the use of consumer devices in the workplace and the ability to work from virtually anywhere and anytime must move from a device-focused view of IT management to one that’s people centric. In reality it is not the device that is mobile, it is the users.
It is important that the IT challenges of BYOD, Mobile device management, cloud computing, and hybrid identities be understood before one can understand how Windows 10 helps address those issues.Define the challenges of enabling mobility

Students will question for themselves the meaning of human freedom, responsibility and identity by reading and responding to Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. The Comedy, which is richly steeped in the medieval culture of the 14th century, still speaks vividly to modern readers struggling with the question, “who am I?” Dante, as a Florentine, a poet, a lover, and religious believer, struggled with the same question in each facet of his life before coming to a moment of vision that wholly transformed him as a person.
As a 21st century reader, you will encounter the poem in a novel online environment that integrates knowledge from the disciplines of literature, history, psychology, philosophy, and theology with modern technology. You will be guided through the poem by means of the "MyDante" Project, an online environment developed by Professor Ambrosio in collaboration with the Georgetown University Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship (CNDLS), which will aid your own contemplative engagement with the poem. Alone and with the edX community, you will reflect on both Dante's interpretation of freedom and how it functions in the formation of personal identity, and the problem of finding appropriate metaphors to discuss these issues in our modern life.
You, the modern reader, will only understand the full implications of Dante's poetry if you participate with it in a way that is personal and is genuinely contemplative. You will discover that contemplative reading goes beyond the literal meaning, and even beyond the traditional allegorical and interpreted meaning, to apply every possible meaning contained in the text to your own life and identity. Through the MyDante platform, you will learn to know yourself in your own historical, personal, and spiritual contexts as you journey towards your understanding of your personal freedom and identity.Students will become familiar with the theory and practice of “Contemplative Reading” that constitutes one of the principal structural dynamics of Liberal Arts education.
Students will be able to apply the general practice of “Contemplative Reading” to Dante’s Divine Comedy.
Students will demonstrate in-depth and relatively advanced familiarity with and knowledge of an epic poem of the highest cultural significance; in specific, Dante’s Divine Comedy.
Students will begin to articulate for themselves their own personal convictions in response to reflection questions about human dignity, freedom and responsibility with which the Divine Comedy inevitably confronts its readers.
Students will engage with the most fundamental goal of Liberal education, promoting the universal dignity of personhood.
Students will become acquainted with the specific contributions the Christian, Catholic and Jesuit tradition of Georgetown University bring to the promotion of human dignity.</description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>783</course_id><title>The Meaning of Rome: The Renaissance and Baroque City</title><published_date>2015-12-22T13:59:12-05:00</published_date><course_length>6 weeks</course_length><effort>4-6 hours per week</effort><subject>Architecture</subject><price>FREE

We can read a city in a number of ways: in its plan, in the buildings that make its streets and public spaces, in the skyline. We can ask, what are the buildings or spaces saying? How do they say it? How does it all stitch together?
In this architecture course you will learn how to “read” Rome, an ancient city, reborn in the fifteenth century and reshaped substantially in the following three centuries. You will discover how Renaissance and Baroque Rome’s urban form, art, and architecture projected the city’s image of itself to its citizens (urbi) and the world (orbi).
Popes, architects, scholars and sculptors invested in Rome a variety of narratives that strove to explain the city’s history, convince its citizens and visitors of its harmony, and exhort society at large to share in and shape its destiny. The city that resulted became a destination for pilgrims and Grand Tourists, and still is today.
The Meaning of Rome: The Renaissance and Baroque City is organized around three themes—the city and memory, the city as reliquary, and the city as theater. In uncovering some of the meaning of Rome, you will be equipped with the skills necessary to consider how our own cities and communities are, or could be, meaningful. You will come away from this course not only better informed about the cities of the past, but also better equipped to think about the cities of the present and the future.
Students who successfully complete all of the required course assignments will have the opportunity to compile a Digication ePortfolio and earn a digital badge. Discover the major players and events that shaped the architecture of Rome and the world beyond. 
Explore ways that sacred relics and monuments, theaters, and other buildings convey meaning and how this meaning reflects a people's values.
Learn to ‘read’ cities, by applying the concepts covered in class to cities other than Rome.</description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>784</course_id><title>国际贸易 | International Economics and Trade</title><published_date>2016-03-08T13:37:47-05:00</published_date><course_length>10 周 | 10 weeks</course_length><effort>每周 2-3 小时 | 2-3 hours per week</effort><subject>Economics &amp; Finance</subject><price>FREE

How can governments become more open and transparent, while simultaneously dealing with various challenges, such as data sensitivity? How can open government data be made available to improve public policy making? Which technologies are available to make governments more open and  use open government data?
Governments all over the world aim to become more open and transparent in order to establish closer ties with their constituents. However, releasing government data involves complex challenges and poses two major concerns. First, many different participants are involved and there are various dependencies between them, and second, the technologies that support open government are fragmented. In addition, it is unclear how different contexts should alter the best practices for open government.
This course explores the foundations and objectives of Open Government and examines current developments, including the opening and reuse of governmental data such as the release of data by governments in America and Europe.
This course will empower you by helping you grasp the key principles surrounding open government.
The topics of the course are applied to concrete cases, which you will be asked to analyze and discuss with your peers.
This course may be of interest to the following:
Students interested in the basics of open government, in data-driven governance and data-driven research

Acerca de este curso
Ingresar a este curso de “Ética de la Felicidad” es el regalo personal más especial que se hace a sí mismo quien quiere tomar en serio su propia existencia. Es el tema más digno de ser meditado en esta vida y la reflexión más valiosa que puede asumir un ser humano para dar dignidad a su vida.
Ser feliz y vivir feliz, son los dos  asuntos en los que nos jugamos nuestra existencia. Las reflexiones sobre estos temas las encontramos mejor planteadas y desarrolladas en los filósofos, porque ellos han concebido su actividad filosófica como una forma de vida válida para todos los seres humanos. Esta actividad se opone a las opiniones inciertas, engañosas y desconocedoras de la naturaleza humana que abundan en nuestro medio cultural y con las cuales se quiere cubrir la felicidad con un manto oscuro e inalcanzable para las personas. Tener una conciencia feliz, permite al ser humano realizar acciones éticas o morales igualmente felices. Este camino ético de la felicidad es el que andaremos en el desarrollo de nuestro curso y en el que cada uno de los participantes encontrará buenos argumentos para ser y vivir feliz cada día.Cómo ser felices en la vida cotidiana, sin engañarse.
Cómo evitar el temor ante lo inevitable, incierto o doloroso.
Qué hacer cuando el dolor invade la existencia.
Manejo de buenos argumentos sobre la felicidad.</description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>790</course_id><title>Programación y políticas financieras, Parte 1: Cuentas macroeconómicas y análisis</title><published_date>2015-09-29T15:33:21-04:00</published_date><course_length>6 weeks</course_length><effort>6 - 10 horas/semana</effort><subject>Economics &amp; Finance</subject><price>FREE</price><level>Intermediate</level><school>IMFx</school><language>Español</language><url>https://www.edx.org/course/programacion-y-politicas-financieras-imfx-fpp-1x</url><status>Future Dates To Be Announced</status><instructors><instructor><name>Christian Johnson</name><bio>null</bio><img>https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/person/image/fpp.1x-johnson-110x110.png</img></instructor><instructor><name>Santiago Acosta Ormaechea</name><bio>null</bio><img>https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/person/image/fpp.1x-acosta-110x110.png</img></instructor><instructor><name>Luciana Juvenal</name><bio>null</bio><img>https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/person/image/fpp.1x-juvenal-110x110.png</img></instructor><instructor><name>Marco Rodríguez</name><bio>null</bio><img>https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/person/image/fpp.1x-rodriguez-110x110.png</img></instructor><instructor><name>Leonardo Martínez</name><bio>null</bio><img>https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/person/image/fpp.1x-martinez-110x110.png</img></instructor><instructor><name>Jorge Restrepo</name><bio>null</bio><img>https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/person/image/mfx-restrepo-110x110.png</img></instructor></instructors><description>This is an Archived Course

The Call of the Wild is a 1903 novel written by Jack London. The story is set in the Yukon, the far northern territory of Canada/Alaska, during the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush. During this period, good sled dogs were in high demand. The novel's main character is a dog named Buck, who lives on a California ranch.

London himself lived nearly a year in the Yukon, collecting material for the novel. Like many older popular novels, The Call of the Wild was serialized in the Saturday Evening Post in the summer of 1903. A month later, it was released as a  book. The novel’s great popularity and success made London famous. The appeal of this story comes from its simplicity as a tale of survival. As early as 1908, the story was adapted to film. Since then, there have been other adaptations.

Participants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion. Course materials will include background information for understanding the text, as well as vocabulary and language support. Assessment will include quizzes and short writing assignments.Read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence

Cognitive Neuroscience Robotics is an interdisciplinary area for development of new information and robot technology systems based on understanding higher functions of the human brain, with the integration of cognitive science, neuroscience, and robotics.
This course introduces Cognitive Neuroscience Robotics with two approaches: the synthetic and the analytic approach. The synthetic approach means an engineering approach to understand human cognitive functions synthetically, trying to understand human cognitive functions by replicating them as artificial systems and putting them into social environments. Specifically, it develops artificial systems such as robots based on findings in neuroscience and physiology, and investigates how they could acquire intelligent behaviors through interaction with others and the environment.
On the other hand, human cognitive activities are investigated analytically. They are supported by higher functions of the brain and have been examined by psychological experiments or brain imaging. With the analytic approach, psychologists, cognitive scientists, and medical doctors are pursuing an understanding of the mechanism of the mind and its biological basis, with the help of engineering and philosophy.
This program will help students make a basis for interdisciplinary research by providing opportunities to understand what is undertaken in other disciplines and how to collaborate and exchange ideas with people from other disciplines. We expect many motivated students to apply.Basic issues in cognitive neuroscience robotics

Le théâtre classique du 17e siècle passe pour le sommet de l’art du théâtre en France. Ses trois représentants les plus connus, Corneille et Racine pour la tragédie et Molière pour la comédie comptent parmi les plus grands dramaturges européens de tous les temps, et Molière reste l’un des auteurs les plus joués dans le monde.
Pour vous les faire découvrir, nous vous emmènerons dans l’environnement historique, sociologique, culturel et littéraire qui les a vu naître. Nous retracerons ainsi l’histoire du « théâtre moderne » depuis sa naissance au milieu du 16e siècle jusqu’aux plus brillantes années du «siècle de Louis XIV» (2e moitié du 17e siècle).
Nous examinerons ainsi les fondements de l’expression «théâtre classique», les fondements du système qui a vu naître les « règles classiques », les fondements d’un dialogue théâtral qui repose entièrement sur « l’alexandrin classique ». Et nous ferons apparaître les tensions créatrices (entre la théorie et la pratique, entre les règles et le refus des règles, entre le texte et le spectacle, entre le classicisme et le baroque, entre la tragédie et l’opéra) qui ont façonné le théâtre de cette période.
Enfin, en vous accompagnant dans la lecture des quelques chefs-d’œuvre qui ont créé une rupture esthétique et marqué les esprits, nous vous ferons pénétrer avec nous dans l’atelier créateur des plus grands dramaturges de l’âge d’or du théâtre français.
Pièces de théâtre à lire: Le Cid et Cinna de Corneille / Les Précieuses ridicules, L’École des femmes et Tartuffe de Molière / Andromaque et Phèdre de Racine.
Ces textes sont tous disponibles en éditions de poche (choisir de préférence «Folio classique” et «Folio Théâtre» ou «Le Livre de poche Classique». On peut les lire aussi en ligne sur le site: http://www.theatre-classique.fr/pages/programmes/PageEdition.php
Nous vous invitons à découvrir avec nous d’où viennent ces trois auteurs, comment ils se sont construits, comment ils se sont distingués des plus brillants dramaturges de leur temps. Et nous vous montrerons quels sont les ingrédients qui ont permis à leurs œuvres d’avoir été sans cesse lues et jouées jusqu’à aujourd’hui — et cela, alors même que de nombreux éléments-clés (l’obéissance à des «règles» et l’usage du vers dit «alexandrin», en particulier) ont disparu depuis longtemps.Situer le théâtre classique (17e siècle), dérouler son histoire, aborder ses caractéristiques

Energy subsidies are an issue in practically every country in the world. Pre-tax subsidies, which arise when energy consumers pay less than the supply cost of energy, are high in many emerging and developing economies, and have risen in recent years. Although pre-tax subsidies are not a large enough problem in advanced economies to cause fiscal difficulties, these countries have tax subsidies, where the taxes imposed on energy are not high enough to account for all of the adverse effects of excessive energy consumption, including on the environment. The issue of energy subsidy reform is not new. Despite widespread recognition of their adverse consequences, energy subsidies have proven difficult to reform.
This course builds an extensive cross-country analysis, which is reported in the recently published IMF book “Energy Subsidy Reform: Lessons and Implications,” to make recommendations on how to best implement reforms aimed at reducing state subsidies on energy.
In the first part of the course, economists from the IMF will introduce the definition and measurement of subsidies, and then describe the economic, social, and environmental implications of subsidies. The second part of the course has two principal purposes: first, to review what works best in energy subsidy reform, in light of country experiences globally; and second, to illustrate successes and failures in particular country contexts by summarizing some case studies.
Whether you are a civil servant working on economic issues for your country or simply interested in better understanding issues related to energy subsidies, this course will provide hands-on training on the design of successful reforms of energy subsidies.
You are welcome to join us in this exciting course!

This introductory global health course aims to frame global health's collection of problems and actions within a particular biosocial perspective. It develops a toolkit of interdisciplinary analytical approaches and uses them to examine historical and contemporary global health initiatives with careful attention to a critical sociology of knowledge. Four physician-anthropologists - Paul Farmer, Arthur Kleinman, Anne Becker, and Salmaan Keshavjee - draw on experience working in Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Americas to investigate what the field of global health comprises, how global health problems are defined and constructed, and how global health interventions play out in both expected and unexpected ways.
The course seeks to inspire and teach the following principles:
A global awareness. This course aims to enable learners to recognize the role of distinctive traditions, governments, and histories in shaping health and well being. In addition, rather than framing a faceless mass of poor populations as the subject of global health initiatives, the course uses ethnographies and case studies to situate global health problems in relation to the lives of individuals, families, and communities.
A foundation in social and historical analysis. The course demonstrates the value of social theory and historical analysis in understanding health and illness at individual and societal levels.
An ethical engagement. Throughout the course, learners will be asked to critically evaluate the ethical frameworks that have underpinned historical and contemporary engagement in global health. Learners will be pushed to consider the moral questions of inequality and suffering as well as to critically evaluate various ethical frameworks that motivate and structure attempts to redress these inequities.
A sense of inspiration and possibility. While the overwhelming challenges of global health could all too easily engender cynicism, passivity, and helplessness, learners will observe that no matter how complex the field of global health and no matter how steep the challenges, it is possible to design, implement, and foster programs and policies that make enormous positive change in the lives of the world’s poorest and suffering people.

A country’s economy consists of three major economic agents; consumers, firms and government. Analyzing the choices made by these economic agents is one of the main subjects of microeconomics.
In this economics and finance course, you will learn how the decisions made by economic agents are represented in the market as demand and supply of commodities. You will also learn about equilibriums in the market, which is when the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied. The derivation of this equilibrium is another main focus of microeconomics. By deriving an equilibrium in a market, we can see at which level the price will be and how much of a transaction will occur.
Since this is an introductory economics course at the most elementary level, no prior knowledge of economics is needed. Anyone who is interested in economics is welcome to take this course.Basic economic concepts and elementary analytical skills

This MIS course will cover supporting tech infrastructures (Cloud, Databases, Big Data), the MIS development/ procurement process, and the main integrated systems, ERPs, such as SAP®, Oracle® or Microsoft Dynamics Navision®, as well as their relationship with Business Process Redesign.
Management Information Systems (MIS) are an integral part of today’s professional landscape. From customer relationship management (CRM) systems handling the daily interactions with clients and prospects, to financial systems issuing invoices and paying bills, day-to-day working life is increasingly controlled by these systems that dictate what to do and how.
This course will focus on what MIS are, how they influence your current or prospective jobs, why they impose specific - and sometimes seemingly absurd - operational procedures, and how to use this knowledge to your advantage in your professional life.
Grasping the key concepts in MIS does not need to be daunting. We will use real world examples to illustrate key concepts, and strive to strike a proper balance between clarity / amenity and conceptual soundness. Join us on this stimulating journey that will allow you to better understand and perform in your current or desired job.Understand Management Information Systems (MIS) and their role in today’s organizations.
Identify how MIS shapes and controls current (or prospective) jobs and how to use this insight to improve your own job performance and satisfaction and and enhance your career prospects.
Become familiar with the major trends in MIS and MIS infrastructures (Cloud, Big Data, ERPs, outsourcing) and how these evolutions will affect workplaces and business strategies.

Do you want to become an expert at structural analysis?
Finite Element Method (FEM) is a powerful tool. FEM is an effective numerical technique for partial differential equations (PDEs) in engineering. The fact that modern engineers can obtain detailed information for structural, thermal, electromagnetic problems with virtual experiments largely gives credit to FEM. The finite element method provides infinite possibilities for engineering, and this course provides a detailed introduction of FEM and its applications in engineering and beyond.
This course is divided into 15 lessons, which introduce basic equations of mechanics, mathematical principles of FEM, realizations in both discrete and continuum structures, various applications in engineering and skills at modeling with FEM software. Examples are demonstrated with MATLAB and ANSYS.Basic equations of mechanics

This physics course offers a sophisticated view of quantum mechanics and its proper mathematical foundation. In this first module of three you will review the basics of wave mechanics and be introduced to the variational principle. You will learn about the technology of spin one-half states and spin operators and get an in-depth look into linear algebra to establish the mathematical foundation necessary to do quantum mechanics. This course concludes by developing the bra-ket notation of Dirac.
To follow this course you will need some basic familiarity with quantum mechanics. You must have seen the Schrödinger equation and studied its solutions for the square well potential, the harmonic oscillator, and the hydrogen atom. You must be proficient in calculus and have some knowledge of linear algebra.
Completing the 3-part Mastering Quantum Mechanics series will give you the necessary foundation to pursue advanced study or research at the graduate level in areas related to quantum mechanics.
Part 1: Wave Mechanics,
Part 2: Quantum Dynamics
Part 3: Entanglement, and Angular Momentum.
The series will follow MIT’s on campus 8.05, the second semester of the three-course sequence on undergraduate quantum mechanics, and will be equally rigorous. 8.05 is a signature course in MIT's physics program and a keystone in the education of physics majors. 
  Learner Testimonial
“I’ve thought long and hard to come up with a better MOOC than this one (I’ve completed 25 of these things over the past 2 years) and can’t do it. 8.05x is #1 and I suspect will stay that way for some time to come.”
 “Being an engineering student from India trying to shift to Physics, I am often faced with the requirement to study topics on my own. Very often this has led me to feel inadequate. 8.05x was the perfect opportunity for me to both gain knowledge and evaluate my understanding on a high quality international platform. It has really exceeded my expectations. Now, at the end of fifteen weeks, I feel more confident and hopefully I am more knowledgeable.”Basics of Wave Mechanics

What is the American Renaissance? How did Dartmouth help foster the formation of the American Renaissance and its reevaluation and reinvention in the twentieth? Why should we, as twenty-first century readers, concern ourselves with this literature?
Join a hybrid community of learners, both online and in residence at Dartmouth College, as we discover how to discern the historical turning points involved in the production and transmission of American Renaissance writings. We will conceptualize the role historical and affective turning points continue to play in the selection, interpretation and valuation of these writings.
Together we will propose continuities and discontinuities between these historical literary works and the present. Along the way we will construct global and temporal mappings between a set of seemingly disparate locations, myths, and traditions.
Join us in a discussion of the work of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Herman Melville, Frederick Douglass, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, and Mark Twain as we explore literary, political and historical context, their desire to create a distinctively national literature, and the ongoing controversy over the local, national, and transnational significance of this literature.The connections between the disparate locations, myths, and traditions found in nineteenth-century American literature.

Albert Einstein has become the icon of modern science. Following his scientific, cultural, philosophical, and political trajectory, this course aims to track the changing role of physics in the 20th and 21st centuries. This history course addresses Einstein's engagement with relativity, quantum mechanics, Nazism, nuclear weapons, philosophy, the arts, and technology, and raises basic questions about what it means to understand physics in its broader history.
 
Participants in the course will follow seventeen lessons, each of which will present a mix of science (no prerequisites!) and the broader, relevant cultural surround.  Some weeks will examine the physics concepts, while others will see excerpts of films or discuss modernist poetry that took off from relativity. Or we might be looking at the philosophical roots and philosophical consequences of Einstein’s works.  At other times we will be fully engaged with historical and political questions: the building, dropping, and proliferation of nuclear weapons, for example. 
 
Typically, in a lesson (about an hour of streamed material), there will be opportunities for individual mini-essay writing, some multiple choice questions to bolster your understanding of the science, and a group activity which might one week be a debate and another a collective commentary on elements of an artwork from 1920s Weimar Germany.

Earn an MITx MicroMasters Credential showing you've mastered the critical skills required to be successful in the rapidly expanding field of supply chain management. Companies need supply chain experts to create and maintain a strategic competitive advantage. This course is the first course offered as part of MIT's MicroMasters Credential in Supply Chain Management.
This supply chain management course provides the foundational skills for supply chain management and logistics. You will learn how to develop and apply analytic tools, approaches, and techniques used in the design and operation of logistics systems and integrated supply chains. The material is taught from a managerial perspective, with an emphasis on where and how specific tools can be used to improve the overall performance and reduce the total cost of a supply chain. We place a strong emphasis on the development and use of fundamental mathematical models to illustrate the underlying concepts involved in both intra- and inter-company logistics operations.
The main topic areas we will focus on are:
Demand Forecasting, Planning, and Management
Inventory Planning, Management, and Control
Transportation Planning, Management, and Execution
While our main objective is to develop and use models to help us analyze these situations, we will make heavy use of examples from industry to provide illustrations of the concepts in practice. This is neither a purely theoretical nor a case study course, but rather an applied analytical course that addresses real problems found in practice.

This health course will show you why exercise is a fundamental component of a healthy lifestyle.
Exercise is more than just an “art of converting big meals and fattening snacks into back strains and pulled muscles by lifting heavy things that don’t need to be moved, or running when no one is chasing you.” (Anonymous quote) Our bodies evolved to move over several millennia.
Did you know that physically active obese individuals live longer than inactive thin individuals? Are you interested in seeing the evidence on the benefits and risks of stretching? What is the best way to treat your ankle, knee, and/or shoulder injury? How does injury affect mood and what are the consequences?
Whether you are a competitive athlete, an aspiring musician or dancer, whether you play for fun or just want to lead an active lifestyle, this course will entertain and challenge you. You will learn the basic and advanced principles of body movement and biological, psychological and social issues related to activity, sport, injury and rehabilitation. The course will include content from leading global experts in multiple fields related to the science of exercise.An understanding of the benefits of physical activity

This course covers the physics, concepts, theories, and models underlying the discipline of aerodynamics. A general theme is the technique of velocity field representation and modeling via source and vorticity fields, and via their sheet, filament, or point-singularity idealizations.
The intent is to instill an intuitive feel for aerodynamic flowfield behavior, and to provide the basis of aerodynamic force analysis, drag decomposition, flow interference estimation, and many other important applications. A few computational methods are covered, primarily to give additional insight into flow behavior, and to identify the primary aerodynamic forces on maneuvering aircraft. A short overview of flight dynamics is also presented.
Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs. Learn more.
  FAQ
Is there a required textbook?
You do not need to buy a textbook. All material is included in the edX course and is viewable online. This includes a full textbook in PDF form. If you would like to buy a print copy of the textbook, a mail-order service will be provided.
Can I still register after the start date?
You can register at any time, but you will not get credit for any assignments that are past due.
How are grades assigned?
Grades are made out of four parts: simple, multiple-choice "Concept Questions " completed during lectures; weekly homework assignments; and two exams, one at the midpoint and one at the end of the course.
How does this course use video? Do I need to watch the lectures live?
Video lectures as well as worked problems will be available and you can watch these at your leisure. Homework assignments and exams, however, will have due dates.
Will the text of the lectures be available?
Yes, transcripts of the course will be made available.
Will the material be made available to anyone registered for this course?
Yes, all the material will be made available to all students.
What are the prerequisites?
The student is expected to be well-versed in basic mechanics, vector calculus, and basic differential equations. Good familiarity with basic fluid mechanics concepts (pressure, density, velocity, stress, etc.) is expected, similar to the content in 16.101x (however, 16.101x is not a requirement). If you do not know these subjects beforehand, following the class material will be extremely difficult. We do not check students for prerequisites, so you are certainly allowed to try.
Who can register for this course?
Unfortunately, learners from Iran, Sudan, Cuba and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time. While edX has received a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to offer courses to learners from Iran and Sudan our license does not cover this course. Separately, EdX has applied for a license to offer courses to learners in the Crimea region of Ukraine, but we are awaiting a determination from OFAC on that application. We are deeply sorry the U.S. government has determined that we have to block these learners, and we are working diligently to rectify this situation as soon as possible.To model and predict the aerodynamic flows about wings and bodies

Pourquoi respirons-nous ? A quoi servent nos poumons ? Quel est le lien entre l’oxygène et la vie ? Ces questions ouvrent un vaste champ de découvertes et de curiosités pour mieux comprendre la  respiration. Ce cours s’adresse à toute personne qui souhaite apprivoiser, s’approprier ou approfondir le fonctionnement de la respiration et des poumons, autrement dit la physiologie respiratoire humaine.
 
Plongés au cœur de l’université et de la pratique hospitalière, durant  sept semaines, vous côtoierez professeurs, professionnels de la santé, internes et étudiants de médecine. Vous y apprendrez des notions de niveau universitaire qui ont été sélectionnées et adaptées afin que toute personne intéressée puisse les comprendre et y donner du sens. Ainsi, nous aborderons des thèmes proches du monde qui vous entoure : la respiration lors d’un effort physique, en altitude, le rôle des polluants atmosphériques, l’asthme….
 
A chaque leçon, un expert abordera des domaines concrets et pratiques : comment apprécier l’oxygénation d’un patient, pourquoi lui administrer de l’oxygène, que signifie hyperventiler….
 
Ce cours vous fera entrer en profondeur dans un monde où l’atmosphère est faite d’anatomie humaine, de physique des volumes et des pressions, de gaz et de sang, d’oxygène et de CO2, de poumons et de tissus, de tabagisme et de bronchite chronique.
 
Au terme de ce cours, vous serez capables de
expliquer et décrire les principes d’oxygénation, de ventilation, de transport et de consommation d’oxygène, de diffusion de gaz entre l’air et le sang… par des schémas et par des calculs utilisant quelques formules fondamentales.
évaluer la quantité et la qualité de l’oxygénation d’un patient,
distinguer les situations normales de celles dites pathologiques.
Bref, vous aurez, pour votre plaisir et votre motivation, approfondi votre culture générale en acquérant des connaissances élevées.

Phenomena as diverse as the motion of the planets, the spread of a disease, and the oscillations of a suspension bridge are governed by differential equations.MATH226x is an introduction to the mathematical theory of ordinary differential equations. This course follows a modern dynamical systems approach to the subject. In particular, equations are analyzed using qualitative, numerical, and if possible, symbolic techniques.
MATH226 is essentially the edX equivalent of MA226, a one-semester course in ordinary differential equations taken by more than 500 students per year at Boston University. It is divided into three parts. MATH226.1 is the first of these three parts.
In MATH226.1, we will discuss biological and physical models that can be expressed as differential equations with one or two dependent variables. We will discuss geometric/qualitative and numerical techniques that apply to all differential equations. When possible, we will study some of the standard symbolic solution techniques such as separation of variables and the use of integrating factors. We will also study the theory of existence and uniqueness of solutions, the phase line and bifurcations for first-order autonomous systems, and the phase plane for two-dimensional autonomous systems. The techniques that we develop will be used to analyze models throughout the course.

A Room with a View is a 1908 novel by English writer E.M. Forster.  

A Room with a View is a romance and a critique of English society at the beginning of the 20th century. As Forster’s most romantic and optimistic book, A Room with a View is considered one of the top 100 English language novels of all times. An award-winning film adaptation of this novel came out in 1985.

Can you really get a patent on a rectangular cell phone shape? Do artists and musicians need over a century of copyright protection for their works? Can you trademark red shoe soles? These are some of the questions that U.S. Congress and the courts have addressed in recent years — and in this IP course, we will, too.
Touching on most areas of commercial and artistic activity, intellectual property (IP) law is an essential component of modern society. In this course, Part 1 of a two-part series, learners will be introduced to a broad overview of the intellectual property laws, the theory underpinning this area of law, and an individual look at patent law.
Part 2 will explore copyright, and trademark law, and consider alternatives to IP and the future of this exciting area of the law.
The focus of this two-part series is on learning some of the seminal legal cases in each area, while also considering the policy implications of the law as it stands.
No previous law experience is required. Join us as we explore the laws and policies that influence and shape our modern lives.Overview and theory of intellectual property law

Con este curso, el alumnado será capaz de aprender y entender los conceptos básicos de visión por computador, además de  implementar de forma práctica algoritmos de análisis de imágenes a través de computadores utilizando la biblioteca de funciones OpenCV.
El Análisis de Imágenes o Visión por Computador es la capacidad de los ordenadores de analizar imágenes capturadas por una cámara y obtener la información de los objetos que se hayan presentes en esa escena. En la actualidad, constituye uno de los campos de la Inteligencia Artificial con un mayor ritmo de desarrollo y que más aplicaciones nuevas está presentando.
Hasta hace pocos años las cámaras digitales solo estaban implantadas en el ambiente industrial. Allí se utilizan con dos fines:
Lograr una mayor interacción entre los robots industriales y el entorno que los rodea.
Conseguir un control de calidad total de los productos fabricados.
Con la aparición de nuevo hardware, cámaras y algoritmos, el mundo de la Visión por Computador ya no se centra exclusivamente en el ambiente industrial sino que se extiende a los smartphones, la industria del videojuego e incluso a los coches.
Otra característica que ha cambiado recientemente es que hasta hace poco tiempo las técnicas de análisis de imágenes eran accesibles solamente a un reducido número de especialistas. Los programas que se utilizaban eran costosos, con poca documentación y que exigían equipos informáticos de gama alta. Esto es ahora muy distinto; en concreto la biblioteca OpenCV, que se verá en el curso, constituyen una solución de altísimo nivel, gratuitas, portables a diversos sistemas operativos y equipos, ordenadores o teléfonos inteligentes y que constituyen de facto un estándar en la comunidad científica.
Para que el alumnado pueda realizar diversas aplicaciones relacionadas con la Visión por Computador, a lo largo del curso se revisan los tipos básicos de elementos y sensores, viéndose las ventajas e inconvenientes de cada uno de ellos, así como las técnicas más usuales de procesar la información que proveen. A partir de dicho procesamiento de la información y de la extracción de características, se presentan diversos métodos para el reconocimiento de patrones.Familiarizarse con el análisis de imágenes a través de computadores.

The world is full of uncertainty: accidents, storms, unruly financial markets, noisy communications. The world is also full of data. Probabilistic modeling and the related field of statistical inference are the keys to analyzing data and making scientifically sound predictions.
Probabilistic models use the language of mathematics. But instead of relying on the traditional "theorem - proof" format, we develop the material in an intuitive -- but still rigorous and mathematically precise -- manner. Furthermore, while the applications are multiple and evident, we emphasize the basic concepts and methodologies that are universally applicable.
The course covers all of the basic probability concepts, including:
multiple discrete or continuous random variables, expectations, and conditional distributions
laws of large numbers
the main tools of Bayesian inference methods
an introduction to random processes (Poisson processes and Markov chains)
The contents of this course are essentially the same as those of the corresponding MIT class (Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability) -- a course that has been offered and continuously refined over more than 50 years. It is a challenging class, but it will enable you to apply the tools of probability theory to real-world applications or your research.
Can I still register after the start date?
You can register at any time, but you will not get credit for any assignments that are past due.
How long does this course last?
The course starts on Tuesday, February 3, 2015 and ends on the due date of the final exam, on Thursday, May 26, 2015.
What is the format of the class?
The course material is organized along units that are aligned with the chapters of the textbook. Each unit contains between one and three lecture sequences. Each lecture sequence consists of short video clips, interleaved with short problems to test your understanding. Each unit also contains a wealth of supplementary material, including videos that go through the solution of various problems.
What textbook do I need for the course?
None - there is no required textbook. The class follows closely the text Introduction to Probability, 2nd edition, by Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, Athena Scientific, 2008; see the publisher's website or Amazon.com for more information. However, while this textbook is recommended, the materials provided by this course are self-contained.
Do I need to watch the lectures live?
Video lectures as well as worked problems will be available and you can watch these at your own convenience. Homework assignments and exams, however, will have due dates.
Will the text of the video clips be available?
Yes, we will provide transcripts of all clips (lectures, worked problems, etc.) that are synched to the videos.
How are grades assigned?
Grades (Pass or Not Pass) are based on a combination of scores on the weekly homework assignments (11 total), two midterm exams, and a final exam.
How much do I need to work for this class?
This is an ambitious class in that it covers a lot of material in substantial depth. Furthermore, the only way of mastering the subject is by actually solving on your own a fair number of problems. MIT students who take the corresponding residential class typically report an average of 11-12 hours spent each week, including lectures, recitations, readings, homework, and exams.The basic structure and elements of probabilstic models

In ordinary life we barely notice the operations of our own minds. In The Conscious Mind - A Philosophical Road Trip, we will illuminate what we take for granted in perception, action, and interaction with others. We’ll explore this mindful awareness through demonstrations, illusions, brainteasers, thought experiments, riddles and jokes, all designed to shake you loose from your ordinary assumptions about the way consciousness works. 
You will explore your own mind and the minds of others in a new way, using a philosophical approach known as phenomenology. You’ll encounter some of the main ideas of the phenomenological tradition, through short readings by Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. Their ideas are provocative and will animate the online and offline conversation as we proceed. But the main approach of the course will be experiential and experimental. You’ll learn phenomenology by doing it and journeying among the structures and elements of your own conscious experience.  Closely observe your mind in action
Illuminate the many assumptions lurking in the background of every waking moment
Recognize “extra-sensory perception,” — an awareness of the non-sensory elements of perception
Understand the dynamics of two interacting minds
Rethink the world as a form of action
Reflect on the phenomenological tradition in philosophy, encountering some of the provocative ideas of Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, Beauvoir, and Merleau-Ponty.

Politics of Freedom: The Civil War, 1861-1865 narrates the history of the American Civil War. While it examines individual engagements and the overall nature of the military conflict, the focus is less on the battlefield than on political, social, and economic change in the Union and the Confederacy. Central to the account are the road to emancipation, the role of black soldiers, the nature of Abraham Lincoln’s wartime leadership, internal dissent in both the North and South, the changing position of women in both societies, and the war’s long-term economic and intellectual impact. We end with a look at the beginnings of Reconstruction during the conflict.
This course is part of the XSeries, Civil War and Reconstruction, which introduces students to the most pivotal era in American history. The Civil War transformed the nation by eliminating the threat of secession and destroying the institution of slavery. It raised questions that remain central to our understanding of ourselves as a people and a nation – the balance of power between local and national authority, the boundaries of citizenship, and the meanings of freedom and equality. This XSeries will examine the causes of the war, the road to secession, the conduct of the Civil War, the coming of emancipation, and the struggle after the war to breathe meaning into the promise of freedom for four million emancipated slaves. One theme throughout the series is what might be called the politics of history – how the world in which a historian lives affects his or her view of the past, and how historical interpretations reinforce or challenge the social order of the present. </description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>837</course_id><title>The Art of Structural Engineering: Bridges</title><published_date>2015-09-22T09:37:31-04:00</published_date><course_length>9 weeks</course_length><effort>2-3 hours per week</effort><subject>Engineering</subject><price>FREE</price><level>Introductory</level><school>PrincetonX</school><language>English</language><url>https://www.edx.org/course/art-structural-engineering-bridges-princetonx-cee262-1x</url><status>Future Dates To Be Announced</status><instructors><instructor><name>Maria Garlock</name><bio>Associate Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Princeton University</bio><img>https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/person/image/mariagarlockphoto.jpg</img></instructor></instructors><description>This is an Archived Course

In this engineering course you will learn how to analyze bridges from three perspectives:
Efficiency = calculations of forces/stresses
Economy = evaluation of societal context and cost
Elegance = form/appearance based on engineering principles, not decoration
With a focus on some significant bridges built since the industrial revolution, the course illustrates how engineering is a creative discipline and can become art. We also show the influence of the economic and social context in bridge design and the interplay between forces and form.
This is the first of three courses on the Art of Structural Engineering, each of which are independent of each other. The two other courses will be on tall buildings/towers and vaults.
No certificates, statements of accomplishment, or other credentials will be awarded in connection with this course.How to solve for the efficiency of structures using the appropriate formulas

To be effective, educational technologies must be designed based on what we know about how people learn. Through interviews with experts in the field, this course explores educational technologies, outlines the theories that influence their development, and examines their use.
Participants will both give and receive feedback from others in the class forums as part of this course. To synthesize main ideas, participants will work towards creating a pitch for a new educational technology.
In Unit 1, we will talk about the history of educational technologies and how these technologies have influenced how we learn.
In Unit 2, we will explore what it means to learn something and different approaches to deepen learning.
In Unit 3, we will focus on active learning and take a closer look at simulations that can foster learning.
Unit 4 introduces the idea of collaborative learning and considers communities of practice.
Unit 5 provides an overview of different types of assessment and delves into how technology is changing the field of assessment.
Unit 6 is all about design-based research, a methodology for research and design of educational innovations.

Protein is found in virtually every part of your body. At least 10,000 different proteins make you what you are and keep you that way.
In this biology course you will learn how proteins drive almost all living processes.
Proteins manufactured by cells perform a broad range of essential functions—the molecular workforce of living organisms.
You will learn how proteins are the cellular manifestation of genetic information. They are assembled into a polymeric structure from monomers derived in part from components in our diet. Proteins catalyze metabolic reactions, replicate DNA, respond to stimuli, provide movement, and much more. Using video lectures, articles, case studies, and molecular models, we will explore how proteins are constructed, how they fold into 3-dimensional shapes, the kinds of bonds that hold these folded structures together, and the immense range of roles that proteins assume from structural proteins found in muscle to catalysts for cellular chemical reactions.
Purification and characterization are essential to understand protein structure and function, and we will identify a variety of methods to uncover how these tiny machines drive almost all living processes.How proteins are structured and fold into functional forms

Did you know that cities take up less than 3% of the earth’s land surface, but more than 50% of the world’s population live in them? And, cities generate more than 70% of the global emissions? Large cities and their hinterlands (jointly called metropolitan regions) greatly contribute to global urbanization and sustainability challenges, yet are also key to resolving these same challenges.
If you are interested in the challenges of the 21st century metropolitan regions and how these can be solved from within the city and by its inhabitants, then this Sustainable Urban Development course is for you!
There are no simple solutions to these grand challenges! Rather the challenges cities face today require a holistic, systemic and transdisciplinary approach that spans different fields of expertise and disciplines such as urban planning, urban design, urban engineering, systems analysis, policy making, social sciences and entrepreneurship.
This MOOC is all about this integration of different fields of knowledge within the metropolitan context. The course is set up in a unique matrix format that lets you pursue your line of interest along a specific metropolitan challenge or a specific theme.
Because we are all part of the challenges as well as the solutions, we encourage you to participate actively! You will have the opportunity to explore the living conditions in your own city and compare your living environment with that of the global community.
You will discover possible solutions for your city’s challenges and what it takes to implement these solutions. Your participation will also contribute to wider research into metropolitan regions as complex systems.
We invite you to take the first steps in understanding the principles that will be essential to transform metropolitan regions into just, prosperous and sustainable places to live in!
This course forms a part of the educational programme of the Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions and is developed by Wageningen UR and TU Delft, two of the founding universities of AMS Institute.The most relevant challenges that metropolitan regions are facing

The transistor has been called the greatest invention of the 20th century – it enables the electronics systems that have shaped the world we live in. Today’s nanotransistors are a high volume, high impact success of the nanotechnology revolution. If you are interested in understanding how this scientifically interesting and technologically important nano-device operates, this course is for you!
This nanotechnology course provides a simple, conceptual framework for understanding the essential physics of nanoscale transistors.  It assumes only a basic background in semiconductor physics and provides an opportunity to learn how some of the fascinating new discoveries about the flow of electrons at the nanoscale plays out in the context of a practical device.
The course is divided into four units:
Transistors fundamentals
Transistor electrostatics
Ballistic MOSFETs
Transmission theory of the MOSFET
The first two units provide an introduction for students with no background in transistors or a quick review for those familiar with transistors.  The third unit treats the ballistic transistor in which electrons move without resistance (in the traditional sense). The last unit uses that Landauer Approach to electron transport, which was developed to understand some striking experiments in nanophysics, to develop an understanding of how electrons flow in modern nanotransistors.  This short course describes a way of understanding MOSFETs that is much more suitable than traditional approaches when the channel lengths are of nanoscale dimensions. Surprisingly, the final result looks much like the traditional, textbook, MOSFET model, but the parameters in the equations have simple, clear interpretations at the nanoscale.
My objective for this course is to provide students with an understanding of the essential physics of nanoscale transistors as well as some of the practical technological considerations and fundamental limits. The goal is to do this in a way that is broadly accessible to students with only a very basic knowledge of semiconductor physics and electronic circuits. The course is designed for anyone seeking a sound, physical, but simple understanding of how nanoscale transistors operate. The course should be useful for advanced undergraduates, beginning graduate students, as well as researchers and practicing engineers and scientists.
This course is the latest in a series offered by the nanoHUB-U project which is jointly funded by Purdue and NSF with the goal of transcending disciplines through short courses accessible to students in any branch of science or engineering. These courses focus on cutting-edge topics distilled into short lectures with quizzes and practice exams.Transistor fundamentals (IV characteristics and device metrics)

How do health professionals predict global patterns of disease? In the case of an epidemic, disaster, or armed conflict, how do experts determine what health care interventions to use? Is it possible to eradicate diseases like guinea worm and polio? How can health systems address their challenges?
In this course, learners will hear from leading experts as they engage with current issues and challenges in global health. The course will examine the global response to diseases, such as the developing Zika outbreak. The backbone of this learning experience is a set of 18 reviews, co-edited by David Hunter and Harvey Fineberg, published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). The combined reviews constitute an up-to-date survey of global health topics from authoritative leaders in the field, covering disease patterns and predictions, infectious and non-communicable diseases, and health systems and institutional responses.
Participants will read the reviews, hear from the authors through a series of interviews, and engage with the content and one another through assessments and discussion questions.

Learn how electronic gadgets are designed, developed, and built as embedded systems that shape the world.
This is a hands-on, learn-by-doing course that shows you how to build solutions to real-world problems using embedded systems. The course uses a bottom-up approach to problem solving, building gradually from simple interfacing of switches and LEDs to complex concepts like display drivers, digital to analog conversion, generation of sound, analog to digital conversion, graphics, interrupts, and communication. We will present both general principles and practical tips for building circuits and programming the microcontroller in the C programming language. You will develop debugging skills using oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, and software instrumentation. Laboratory assignments are first performed in simulation, and then you will build and debug your system on the real microcontroller. At the conclusion of this course you will possess the knowledge to build your own arcade-style game from the ground up.
This is the third time we have offered this course. Since the reviews have been overwhelmingly positive we do not plan major changes from the previous offering of the course. There are 14 labs, but students can pick and choose seven of them to achieve certification. The three labs that students found most rewarding were the finite state machine traffic light controller, generating sound using a digital to analog convertor, and creating a smart object using Wifi communication. This time we will make minor changes to a few labs to enhance the fun and focus the learning on embedded systems.
To complete this course, you will be required to purchase a Texas Instruments TM4C123 microcontroller kit and a few electronic components. This microcontroller has a state-of-the-art ARM Cortex-M4 processor.
We will provide instructions about purchasing the kit and installing required software at: http://edx-org-utaustinx.s3.amazonaws.com/UT601x/index.html.
FAQ
How will the Spring 2016 course be the same as the course run Spring 2015?
This course will be lab-based using the same Texas Instruments Tiva series TM4C123 LaunchPad and the set of extra components. We will continue to use the Keil development system, and students will first develop/test in simulation followed by testing on the real board. 12 of the 14 labs will be essentially the same and two labs will be upgraded. Same as last year, students will need to complete at least seven of the labs on the real board to achieve certification.
How will the Spring 2016 course be different from the course run Spring 2015?
This time we will make minor changes to a few labs to enhance the fun and focus the learning on embedded systems.
Is this class related to a campus course of The University of Texas at Austin?
Yes, this course corresponds to the Electrical and Computer Engineering course EE319K Introduction to Embedded Systems, which is a required course offered in the freshman year to all ECE students and some BME students.
Is there a textbook associated with this class?
The class is based on the textbook Embedded Systems: Introduction to ARM Cortex-M Microcontrollers ISBN: 978-1477508992. However, the purchase of the textbook is not required.
Do I need a Windows PC?
Yes, any system running Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 10 will be ok. Furthermore, with a third party virtualization software like Parallels or VMware Fusion, one can install the Windows operating system on a Mac.
How much does it cost to take this class?
It does not cost anything to take the class. However, since this a lab-based class, there is a lab kit you will purchase. You will also have the option of obtaining an ID Verified certificate for a $50 fee.
How much does the kit cost?
In the US one can purchase the microcontroller board and parts for about $40 USD plus shipping. There is also an optional graphics display for an additional $10 USD plus shipping. The optional graphics display will make the last lab a lot more fun. The CC3100 Boosterpack costs $20 USD plus shipping and will be required if you wish to complete the Wifi lab.
Can I take this course without buying the kit?
Yes, there are three approaches to taking this class.
You could listen to the videos, read the assignments, and play with the interactive learning tools.
The second option involves installing the Keil uVision integrated development environment on a Windows PC, and performing the lab assignments in simulation mode.
The third option, which fully captures the essence of embedded systems, can be done by performing the lab assignments on a real system that you will purchase.
Can I use another microcontroller?
If you are following approach one, where you are listening to the videos, reading the assignments and playing with the interactive tools, then you can use any microcontroller. However, if you wish to obtain certification, you will need to use the Tiva series TM4C123 so you can interact with the automatic graders.
What does it mean for the display to be optional?
In the last lab you will build an arcade-style game. We expect most students will connect the microcontroller board to the PC. In this manner the game output can be displayed on a window of the PC. However, for about $10 USD plus shipping, you can order a small Nokia 5110 LCD display so your game can be operated in a stand-alone fashion.
Will this course really take 10 hours per week?
The first option of just listening, reading and playing with interactive animations will take two or three hours per week. The second option of performing the labs in simulation will take five or six hours per week. The third option of building and testing systems on the real microcontroller will require 10 hours per week.
Can I take this course if I have never programmed before?
Anyone is allowed register, but we believe to get the maximum benefit you should have prior programming experience at an introductory level. However, this could be your second class involving programming.
Can I contact the Instructors or Teaching Assistants?
Yes, but not directly. The discussion forums are the appropriate venue for questions about the course. Instructors will monitor these forums and try to respond to the most important questions; in many cases responses from other students will be adequate and faster.
I really want to take this course, what is next?
You should purchase the microcontroller and extra electronics before the start of class. This class is available worldwide and we will provide region-specific methods to obtain the kit at http://edx-org-utaustinx.s3.amazonaws.com/UT601x/index.html.

In 2011, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake triggered a major tsunami that devastated northeast Japan, killing more than 15,000 people and crippling a nuclear power plant.
Natural disasters like this one can be seen throughout our Earth’s history. They will continue to prey on all regions, bringing devastation when they strike. But are we so powerless? What if we could improve preparedness over the world and limit the devastation caused by coastal disasters?
These are the questions we at Waseda University have been asking. Now we would like to share our experiences and achievements in disaster prevention with the rest of the world.
In this environmental studies course, you will learn about coastal disasters. Using worldwide field surveys, you will develop an understanding of the nature of tsunamis and storm surges. You will learn how coastal areas are attacked, understand how human lives are lost and infrastructure destroyed. Using numerical simulations and hydraulic experiments, we will present you with different scenarios, teaching you about the mechanisms behind a coastal disaster.
You will look at successful coastal disaster prevention concepts and methods. This will include defenses such as coastal dikes, as well as the implementation of essential evacuation plans. Ultimately, you will learn how to reduce the effects of coastal disasters and how to protect yourself and others if a disaster strikes.
Whether you are an emergency management official, a city developer, an engineering student, or living in a potential natural coastal disaster community, this environmental studies course will teach you how we can improve disaster preparedness and management throughout the world.The science and mechanisms of tsunamis and storm surges

This is the last of five modules to introduce concepts and current frontiers of atomic physics and to prepare you for cutting-edge research:
8.421.1x: Resonance
8.421.2x: Atomic structure and atoms in external field
8.421.3x: Atom-Light Interactions 1 -- Matrix elements and quantized field
8.421.4x: Atom-Light interactions 2 --  Line broadening and two-photon transitions
8.421.5x: Coherence
This fifth module, 8.421.5x, looks at a central theme of atomic physics - coherence. This includes coherence of single atoms for two-level systems and three-level systems, and coherence between atoms, which can result in superradiant behavior.
At MIT, the content of the five modules makes the first of a two-semester sequence (8.421 and 8.422) for graduate students interested in Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics. This sequence is required for Ph.D. students doing research in this field.
In these modules you will learn about the interaction of radiation with atoms: resonance; absorption, stimulated and spontaneous emission; methods of resonance, dressed atom formalism, masers and lasers, cavity quantum electrodynamics; structure of simple atoms, behavior in very strong fields; fundamental tests: time reversal, parity violations, Bell's inequalities; and experimental methods.
Completing the two-course sequence allows you to pursue advanced study and research in cold atoms, as well as specialized topics in condensed matter physics.
  FAQ
Who can register for this course?
Unfortunately, learners from Iran, Cuba, Sudan and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time. While edX has received a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to offer courses to learners from Iran and Sudan our license does not cover this course.
Separately, EdX has applied for a license to offer courses to learners in the Crimea region of Ukraine, but we are awaiting a determination from OFAC on that application. We are deeply sorry the U.S. government has determined that we have to block these learners, and we are working diligently to rectify this situation as soon as possible.

This college-level, calculus-based Introductory Newtonian Mechanics course covers all of the topics and learning objectives specified in the College Board Course Description for Advanced Placement®Physics C (Mechanics). It covers Newton’s Laws, Kinematics, Energy, Momentum, Rigid Body Rotation, and Angular Momentum. The course covers applications of these basic principles to simple harmonic motion, orbital motion, and to problems that involve more than one basic principle. These principles also underlie the 12 online laboratory activities.
Our emphasis is on helping students learn expert-like ways of solving challenging problems, many of which are similar to problems on previous Advanced Placement Examinations in Mechanics C. We stress a key insight: mechanics is about forces changing motion. We apply this concept to organizing the core knowledge in a way that helps students apply it to sophisticated multi-concept problems. We feel this is the best way to prepare students for success not only on the AP Examination but also in other college-level science, technology, engineering and math courses that emphasize problem-solving.
If you are a teacher looking to learn better ways to teach your students, or are interested in using some of our MOOC materials in your own classroom—possibly as a private online course for your students—we strongly encourage you to sign up for our teacher’s discussion cohort, a “private discussion room” for teachers to share pedagogical ideas and instructional techniques.To join these discussions, verify yourself as a teacher by clicking this link, and we will enroll you in the teacher’s discussion cohort.

You do not need to complete the optional weeks in order to receive a certificate, but we strongly encourage you to complete these units, especially if you are preparing for the College Board’s AP Physics C: Mechanics exam.
Is there a required textbook?
You do not need to buy a textbook. A complete eText, including worked-examples and some video lectures, is included in this edX course and is viewable online. If you would like to use a textbook with the course (for example, as a reference), most calculus-level books are suitable. Introductory physics books by Young and Freedman, Halliday, Resnick, &amp; Walker, or Knight are all appropriate (and older editions are fine).
My physics is a little rusty. How should I prepare for this course?
If you would like to brush-up on basic mechanics skills before taking this course, we recommend the brief warm-up course, On-Ramp to AP Physics C: Mechanics. 
What if I take a vacation?
The course schedule is designed with this in mind! Course content is always released at least 3 weeks ahead of the deadline, providing you with the opportunity for flexibility in scheduling.
How are grades assigned?
There are five parts of the course that are worth points: (1) Checkpoint problems are incorporated into the reading; (2) most weeks have an interactive lab component; (3) more involved homework problems occur at the end of each week and (4) quizzes at the end of every 1-2 weeks; (5) the course culminates in a final exam. Each category is worth a varying number of points; and you are allowed several attempts on each problem. A final grade of at least 60% is needed for certification; hence you will not have to do every problem.
Note: Taking this Course Involves Using Some Experimental Materials
The RELATE group that authors and administers this course is a physics education research group. We are dedicated to understanding and improving education, especially online. In one of the only published studies measuring learning in a massive open online course (MOOC), we showed that a previous iteration of this course produced slightly more conceptual learning than a traditionally taught on-campus course. Currently, we are working to find just what caused this learning.  
In this course, the RELATE group will be comparing learning from different types of online activities that will be administered to randomly assigned sub-groups of course participants. At certain points in the course, new vs. more traditional sequences of activities will be assigned to different sub-groups. We will then use common questions to compare the amount of associated learning. Which group receives the new activities will be switched so that all groups will have some new activities and some traditional ones.
Our experimental protocol has been approved by the MIT Committee on Use of Human Subjects. As part of this approval we have the obligation to inform you about these experiments and to assure you that:
We will not divulge any information about you that may be identified as yours personally (e.g. a discussion post showing your user name). 
The grade for obtaining a certificate will be adjusted downwards (from 60%) to compensate if one group has slightly harder materials.
Note: By clicking on the “Enroll Now” button, you indicate that you understand that everyone who participates in this course is randomly assigned to one of the sub-groups described above.Newtonian Mechanics beyond a first-year introductory course

In this education and teacher training course we will explore effective teaching methods for biology. We will emphasize approaches proven to be effective and show you how to implement them. We will also give you the opportunity to reflect on your own teaching experience and exchange ideas and share challenges with other learners in the course.
We will begin by looking at the most common method of teaching science, the lecture. We’ll discuss what the lecture method does well and look at data that illustrates when it is less effective. You will hear highly successful teachers talk about their experience with lecture and how they modified their lecture time to more actively engage students. We’ll investigate creating learning objectives and how they can be used to communicate your expectations to students. You will practice writing your own learning objectives and see how they can streamline exam construction. We’ll look at a variety of ways to include active learning during class time, discuss how active learning strategies support your learning objectives, and give you practice developing learning activities for biology topics you find challenging to teach. 
Lastly, we’ll look at how to use resources for student learning outside of class, and how to know that your students have successfully learned from both in-class and outside of class activities.
Our course is designed for instructors, or instructors-to-be, of undergraduate-level biology. High school instructors of AP Biology, post-doctoral fellows and graduate students looking ahead to teaching should find the course useful. The course can serve as a means of professional development. There are no pre-requisites, although prior satisfactory completion of a college biology course is highly recommended.How to effectively use lecture

This course provides a quantitative and model-based introduction to basic economic principles, and teaches how to apply them to make sense of a wide range of real world problems. Examples of applications include predicting the impact of technological changes in market prices, calculating the optimal gasoline tax, and measuring the value of new products. This is a real Caltech class. It will be taught concurrently to Caltech and on-line students. This has two implications. On the costs side: the class is challenging, makes extensive use of calculus, and will demand significant effort. On the benefit side: successful completion of the class will provide you with an in-depth understanding of basic economics, and will permanently change the way you see the world.Understand, apply, and analyze calculus-based economic models

Jane Eyre is a novel by English writer Charlotte Brontë. It was published in 1847 under her pen name, Currer Bell.

Jane Eyre is often referred to as a bildungsroman, or coming-of-age story. It follows the feelings and experiences of the protagonist and title character, Jane Eyre, from youth to adulthood.  The story has both elements of social criticism as well as a strong moral core. Many critics have considered this book to be ahead of its time, mostly due to Jane’s individualism, as well as story themes that include classism, sexuality, religion, and feminism.

Participants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion. Course materials will include background information for understanding the text, as well as vocabulary and language support. Assessment will include quizzes and short writing assignments.Read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence

Creating software that works—as is—for people around the world requires thoughtful design.
People speak different languages and the countries they live in standardize on different currencies, date formats—even envelope sizes. Colors have different symbolism depending on cultural norms. And to accommodate all these differences, you want to do everything you possibly can to avoid the colossal effort of redesigning and rebuilding a different edition of your software for each and every market.
This computer science course focuses on two aspects of “world-ready” design. The first is globalization: making the user experience and the code that implements it generic enough to accommodate most market differences. The second aspect is localization: customizing features for the local market. The more globalized your design, the easier it is to localize.
The course instructors include designers and programmers who have worked on globalization and localization of some of the world’s most successful software. They’ve experienced the good, the bad, and the ugly of creating world-ready software, and they’re here to ensure your software’s user experience is one all your customers will enjoy, regardless of where they’re from or what language they speak.
Previous programming or User Experience design experience is always helpful, but not necessary for this course. Completion of “Developing International Software” is also helpful, but not essential.What a “world-ready” user experience means

Optimizing Microsoft Windows Server storage is key to keeping pace with your organization’s ever increasing data needs. Once you have initially configured your Microsoft Windows Server storage you will want to take advantage of three key features: iSCSI Storage, Storage Spaces and Data Deduplication.
iSCSI is a protocol that supports remote access to SCSI-based storage devices over a TCP/IP network. It provides and easy to use alternative to Storage Area Networks (SANs) and can use existing infrastructure.
Storage Spaces lets you group physical disks together and present them as a single logical disk. This makes it easy to manage and dynamically allocate storage.
Data Deduplication is a service that identifies and removes duplications within data. The goal of Data Deduplication is to maximize the use of disk space.
This course follows INF201.21, Implementing Microsoft Windows Server Disks and Volumes but it is not required.

This is the fourth of five modules to introduce concepts and current frontiers of atomic physics and to prepare you for cutting-edge research:
8.421.1x: Resonance
8.421.2x: Atomic structure and atoms in external field
8.421.3x: Atom-Light Interactions 1 -- Matrix elements and quantized field
8.421.4x: Atom-Light interactions 2 --  Line broadening and two-photon transitions
8.421.5x: Coherence
The fourth module, 8.421.4x, includes a comprehensive discussion of line broadening effects, including Doppler effect, sidebands for trapped particles, power broadening, and effects of interactions and collisions. The concept of two-photon transitions is relevant for Raman processes and light scattering.
At MIT, the content of the five modules makes the first of a two-semester sequence (8.421 and 8.422) for graduate students interested in Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics. This sequence is required for Ph.D. students doing research in this field.
In these modules you will learn about the interaction of radiation with atoms: resonance; absorption, stimulated and spontaneous emission; methods of resonance, dressed atom formalism, masers and lasers, cavity quantum electrodynamics; structure of simple atoms, behavior in very strong fields; fundamental tests: time reversal, parity violations, Bell's inequalities; and experimental methods.
Completing the two-course sequence allows you to pursue advanced study and research in cold atoms, as well as specialized topics in condensed matter physics.
  FAQ
Who can register for this course?
Unfortunately, learners from Iran, Cuba, Sudan and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time. While edX has received a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to offer courses to learners from Iran and Sudan our license does not cover this course.
Separately, EdX has applied for a license to offer courses to learners in the Crimea region of Ukraine, but we are awaiting a determination from OFAC on that application. We are deeply sorry the U.S. government has determined that we have to block these learners, and we are working diligently to rectify this situation as soon as possible.

How long should the handle of your spoon be so that your fingers do not burn while mixing chocolate fondue? Can you find a shape that has finite volume, but infinite surface area? How does the weight of the rider change the trajectory of a zip line ride? These and many other questions can be answered by harnessing the power of the integral. 
But what is an integral? You will learn to interpret it geometrically as an area under a graph, and discover its connection to the derivative.  You will encounter functions that you cannot integrate without a computer and develop a big bag of tricks to attack the functions that you can integrate by hand. The integral is vital in engineering design, scientific analysis, probability and statistics. You will use integrals to find centers of mass, the stress on a beam during construction, the power exerted by a motor, and the distance traveled by a rocket.

Decision makers often struggle with questions such as: What should be the right price for a product? Which customer is likely to default in his/her loan repayment? Which products should be recommended to an existing customer? Finding right answers to these questions can be challenging yet rewarding.
Predictive analytics is emerging as a competitive strategy across many business sectors and can set apart high performing companies. It aims to predict the probability of the occurrence of a future event such as customer churn, loan defaults, and stock market fluctuations – leading to effective business management.
Models such as multiple linear regression, logistic regression, auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), decision trees, and neural networks are frequently used in solving predictive analytics problems. Regression models help us understand the relationships among these variables and how their relationships can be exploited to make decisions.
This course is suitable for students/practitioners interested in improving their knowledge in the field of predictive analytics.  The course will also prepare the learner for a career in the field of data analytics. If you are in the quest for the right competitive strategy to make companies successful, then join us to master the tools of predictive analytics.Understand how to use predictive analytics tools to analyze real-life business problems.

All over the world, including India, there is an aspiration that every student should be actively engaged in their learning. Achieving this aspiration demands highly skilled teachers and quality teacher education. 
 
This course introduces teacher educators to Open Educational Resources – freely available learning materials that can be adapted for use in particular contexts.  The course explores how you can use OER in the design and delivery of your teacher education programmes to help you bring about the transformation of classroom teaching and learning.   Throughout the course there will be a particular focus on the OER generated by TESS- India. These innovative multi-lingual text and video OER (www.tess-india.edu.in) aim to support teachers in developing participatory approaches through modelling links between theory and practice in classroom activities.   You will explore the values and pedagogy underpinning teacher education OER from TESS-India and other repositories and learn how you can adapt and incorporate these OER for your own contexts and students. 
 
Through participation in the course you will develop skills in locating, adapting and producing OER. Collaboration and the co-creation of OER will be key themes; you will be introduced to ways of working and open practices that you will be able to take forward into your professional working.  Through the course you may also form and strengthen your professional support network of fellow teacher educators. 
 
The course is designed primarily for teacher educators working in the Indian context in both pre-service and in-service education with primary and secondary school teachers in formal and informal programmes. However it has significant application for teacher educators globally.

As Parcerias Público-Privadas (PPPs) tornaram-se um instrumento essencial para o crescimento produtivo, econômico e social dos países da América Latina e Caribe. Ao desenvolver e programar as PPPs observam-se restrições nas capacidades técnicas dos responsáveis, em especial no setor público.
Para preencher esta lacuna, IDBx desenvolveu este curso, o primeiro MOOC disponível em Português para aprender a planejar, projetar e implementar PPPs para projetos de desenvolvimento na América Latina e no Caribe.
Este curso busca dividir experiências de instituições internacionais líderes com a finalidade de ajudar a diminuir lacunas de conhecimento na utilização efetiva das PPPs, oferecendo ideias, soluções e lições aprendidas para lidar com os desafios ou restrições às capacidades técnicas e administrativas do setor público da região. As lições contidas no MOOC se aplicam a diferentes setores como infraestrutura, saúde, educação, banda larga e setor fiscal, levando em conta contextos nacionais de vários países da região, incluindo Peru, México, Colômbia e Brasil. 
Para este efeito, o curso coloca à disposição dos participantes leituras selecionadas, vídeos, tutoriais de análises e outros recursos de aprendizagem.
O curso é baseado nos conteúdos do Guia de Referência sobre Parcerias Público-Privadas (PPPs) versão 2.0, desenvolvido e publicado em 2014 pelo BID, Banco Mundial (BM) e Banco Asiático de Desenvolvimento (ADB).
A elaboração deste curso foi financiada pelo Programa Especial para o Desenvolvimento Institucional (SPID). Mais informações em  SPID.

Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) have become an essential instrument for productive, economic, and social growth in Latin American countries and the Caribbean. However, when developed and implemented, those responsible for PPPs' implementation have had limited technical capacity, particularly in the public sector.
In order to address this need, IDB has developed the first MOOC available in Portuguese, to learn how to plan, design, and implement PPPs for development projects in Latin America and the Caribbean.
This course seeks to share the experiences of leading international institutions to contribute to close the knowledge gaps for the effective use of PPPs, providing ideas, solutions, and lessons learned to face the challenges or limitations of technical and administrative capacity in the region's public sector. The lessons from this course are applicable to different sectors such as infrastructure, health, education, broad band, fiscal sector, and take into consideration national contexts from various countries in the region, including Perú, México, Colombia and Brasil.
For this goal, this course presents selected readings, videos, tutorials and other knowledge products.
The course is based on the Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) Reference Guide Version 2.0, developed and published in 2014 by the IDB, World Bank (WB) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).
The preparation of this course was financed by the Special Program for Institutional Development (SPID) of the Inter-American Development Bank. For more information visit the SPID website.Os princípios e conceitos de uma PPP, quando e como você usar.

This is the third of five modules to introduce concepts and current frontiers of atomic physics and to prepare you for cutting-edge research:
8.421.1x: Resonance
8.421.2x: Atomic structure and atoms in external field
8.421.3x: Atom-Light Interactions 1 -- Matrix elements and quantized field
8.421.4x: Atom-Light interactions 2 --  Line broadening and two-photon transitions
8.421.5x: Coherence
The third module, 8.421.3x, covers how atoms interact with light. First, dipole and higher order couplings are introduced, and concrete examples for selection rules and matrix elements are given. After quantizing the electromagnetic field and introducing photons, the Jaynes-Cummings model and vacuum Rabi oscillations are presented. Coherent and incoherent time evolution are discussed, also in the framework of Einstein's A and B coefficients.
At MIT, the content of the five modules makes the first of a two-semester sequence (8.421 and 8.422) for graduate students interested in Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics. This sequence is required for Ph.D. students doing research in this field.
In these modules you will learn about the interaction of radiation with atoms: resonance; absorption, stimulated and spontaneous emission; methods of resonance, dressed atom formalism, masers and lasers, cavity quantum electrodynamics; structure of simple atoms, behavior in very strong fields; fundamental tests: time reversal, parity violations, Bell's inequalities; and experimental methods.
Completing the two-course sequence allows you to pursue advanced study and research in cold atoms, as well as specialized topics in condensed matter physics.
  FAQ
Who can register for this course?
Unfortunately, learners from Iran, Cuba, Sudan and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time. While edX has received a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to offer courses to learners from Iran and Sudan our license does not cover this course.
Separately, EdX has applied for a license to offer courses to learners in the Crimea region of Ukraine, but we are awaiting a determination from OFAC on that application. We are deeply sorry the U.S. government has determined that we have to block these learners, and we are working diligently to rectify this situation as soon as possible.

Este curso te ayudará a tomar el control sobre los datos, a darles sentido y, de esta manera, usarlos para mejorar tus decisiones.
This course will help you take control over data and use it to improve your decisions.
**Este curso será impartido en español**
En esta era de la información, los datos están disponibles en todos lados y creciendo a una tasa exponencial. ¿Cómo podemos darle sentido a todos los datos? ¿Cómo aprovechamos los datos en el momento de tomar decisiones? ¿Cómo utilizamos los datos para que nos ayuden a guiar la planificación estratégica de nuestras políticas? Tanto si eres ciudadano como planificador de políticas deberías poder responder a estas preguntas.
En este curso podrás fortalecer tus capacidades de comprensión e interpretación de datos utilizando la plataforma desarrollada por el BID “Números para el Desarrollo.” A través de estas herramientas podrás mejorar tu proceso de toma de decisiones estratégicas basándolas en el análisis de datos, especialmente en el desempeño de la función pública.
Al finalizar el curso contarás con instrumentos para navegar entre los datos, realizar e interpretar visualizaciones y comprender los diferentes tipos de análisis de datos según el problema estudiado.
Tranquilo, no se trata de un curso de estadística, sólo vas a adquirir los conocimientos necesarios para interpretar gráficas o reportes estadísticos. Finalmente, adquirirás las bases para fundamentar tus decisiones en datos comprobables, más allá de tu intuición.
El curso está compuesto por diferentes actividades prácticas donde se podrán aplicar los conocimientos adquiridos, casos reales del BID donde se promueve el análisis y se presentan las realidades a las que están expuestos los funcionarios públicos de la región y algunos retos creativos que tienen un nivel más alto de complejidad.
Finalmente, el curso tiene lecturas teóricas, videos que permiten generar una mejor compresión de temas del curso y de foros de discusión donde se abren espacios para la construcción grupal alrededor de una pregunta orientadora.
In this period of information, data is available everywhere and growing at an exponential rate. How can we use data? How do we take advantage of data when making decisions? How do we use data to guide strategic planning of policies?. Whether you are a citizen or policy maker you should be able to answer these questions.
In this course you would strengthen your skills on understanding and explaining data by using the IDB platform "Numbers for Development." Through these tools you can improve the process of making strategic decisions based on the analysis of data, especially in the performance of public functions.
After completing the course you will have instruments to navigate between data, perform and interpret displays and able to understand different types of data analysis according to the problem studied.
Don’t panic, it is not a statistics course; you’re going to acquire the knowledge to understand graphs and statistical reports. Finally, you will acquire tangible foundation to base your decisions on proper data, beyond your intuition.
The course consists of various practical activities where you can apply the acquired knowledge, there are real case studies of IDB, where the analysis is needed together with real public officials reality when working in the region, also there are some creative challenges at higher-level off complexity.
Finally, the course has readings, videos allowing the generation of better understanding of the course and open to discussion among the participants.La importancia de la relación entre el análisis e interpretación de datos y  la toma de decisiones.

Through the process of evolution, animals have developed their biological features and their cultures based on their surrounding environments. How we live our lives today is a direct result of features developed from our primate ancestors as they adapted to new environments.
In primatology, it is essential to think about how cultural development and biological natures are inseparable.
This course will help you rediscover the process of evolution and will introduce primatological studies conducted by researchers at Kyoto University, Japan. Based on carefully conducted research on primate species, we will explore the origins of human beings and provide you with examples of common similarities between human beings and non-human primates.
We will analyze basic features, such as foraging, mating, aggression, and communication from the primatological viewpoint. Furthermore, cultural and social aspects of human society, from the formation of family groups to community activities, will be considered thoroughly, in comparison to those of monkeys and apes.
Our goal is to broaden your view of humans to a wider extent and think dynamically about your biology in terms of human evolution. Through acquiring knowledge of basic primatology in this course, you will establish a viewpoint to think and discuss the evolutionary process of human, and human society, in conjunction with those of our close relatives.
No previous academic knowledge is required. Join us and evolve together with “Evolution of the Human Sociality.”Basic concepts and scientific evidences of primatology

This course introduces you to the main elements of a good “science of delivery” case study and teaches you how to plan your research, conduct interviews, and organize your writing.    
The “science of delivery” begins with a simple observation. We often have a vision of the right policies or strategies for improving health, safety, and economic well being, but the real problem is getting things done. Even a simple policy intervention such as child vaccination requires much more than nurses and a stock of vaccine to be effective.
Case studies are a vital tool for sharing insight about the how of policy implementation and institutional reform. They trace the steps taken to produce results, show solutions people have devised to address anticipated challenges and overcome unanticipated obstacles. Case studies help us think about how to adapt approaches so that they work in different contexts.
This social science course is most suitable for:
Practitioners who want to document and analyze their efforts to implement a program or build a new institution
Researchers who want to trace how programs achieved results
Graduate students who want an introduction to one type of case study method
No certificates, statements of accomplishment, or other credentials will be awarded in connection with this course.Key elements of a science of delivery case study

Around the globe, there are public servants and civic leaders who want to create a better future for their fellow citizens. The challenge is how to deliver—how to create new practices, build new institutions, implement new policies, and transform incentives to sustain transformation and achieve sustainability.
This course is about the “hows” of generating institutional change in hard places. Each week we focus on a different kind of challenge. You will read a case study, examine a problem in detail, help create a “solutions" toolkit, and then apply these insights to a second case.
The course introduces concepts and insights from applied political economy and the science of delivery. Topics include:
Reducing delay, error, and diversion of funds in citizen services
Using citizen monitoring and community-driven projects to improve services in rural areas
Preventing conflicts of interest or self-dealing from blocking institutional reform; building trust and community and changing public expectations
Overcoming capacity traps (what to do when brain drain, political turbulence, or other problems de-skill government)
Facilitating coordination at the cabinet level
Developing a strategy and the incentives to sustain change.
Drawn from actual experience around the world, each case starts with the problems a reform leader faced and traces the steps taken to address these. You will have a chance to assess the process and decide whether the solutions might work in your own context, as well as offer new proposals.
Through quizzes and open response assignments, you will be able to share ideas with others and practice what you have learned.
No certificates, statements of accomplishment, or other credentials will be awarded in connection with this course.A conceptual vocabulary to help identify and analyze obstacles to building better government
A solutions tool-kit for solving several common yet difficult problems
Familiarity with some important contemporary reform leaders, their work, and their ideas

When you're sick, you may wonder, "Why me?" But the real question should be, "Why am I not sick all the time?" You might even ask, "Why does my body respond with a fever, and is it really a good idea to lower it?" This course explores immunology, how the body defends itself from constant assault by parasites and pathogens. This course will present the fundamentals of both innate and adaptive immunity, emphasizing functional interactions among cells and organs. We will cover signaling, pathogen recognition and the division of labor among myeloid, lymphoid and supporting cells. The subject matter will also supply health professionals and biomedical researchers with the basic vocabulary and concepts necessary to understand both clinical press releases and primary literature. The course materials also provide support to other immunology instructors by presenting difficult concepts in creative ways using analogies and models.The importance of disease defense

This is the second of five modules to introduce concepts and current frontiers of atomic physics and to prepare you for cutting-edge research:
8.421.1x: Resonance
8.421.2x: Atomic structure and atoms in external field
8.421.3x: Atom-Light Interactions 1 -- Matrix elements and quantized field
8.421.4x: Atom-Light interactions 2 --  Line broadening and two-photon transitions
8.421.5x: Coherence
The second module, 8.421.2x, describes atomic structure, including electronic levels, fine structure, hyperfine structure and Lamb shift.  You will then learn about how electric and magnetic fields shift atomic levels. The discussion of time-dependent electric fields prepares you for the interactions of atoms with light and for the dressed atom picture.
At MIT, the content of the five modules makes the first of a two-semester sequence (8.421 and 8.422) for graduate students interested in Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics. This sequence is required for Ph.D. students doing research in this field.
In these modules you will learn about the interaction of radiation with atoms: resonance; absorption, stimulated and spontaneous emission; methods of resonance, dressed atom formalism, masers and lasers, cavity quantum electrodynamics; structure of simple atoms, behavior in very strong fields; fundamental tests: time reversal, parity violations, Bell's inequalities; and experimental methods.
Completing the two-course sequence allows you to pursue advanced study and research in cold atoms, as well as specialized topics in condensed matter physics.
  FAQ
Who can register for this course?
Unfortunately, learners from Iran, Cuba, Sudan and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time. While edX has received a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to offer courses to learners from Iran and Sudan our license does not cover this course.
Separately, EdX has applied for a license to offer courses to learners in the Crimea region of Ukraine, but we are awaiting a determination from OFAC on that application. We are deeply sorry the U.S. government has determined that we have to block these learners, and we are working diligently to rectify this situation as soon as possible.

Learn to use the open development tool, App Inventor, to program on Android devices. You will learn how to design and build mobile apps -- apps that are aware of their location, send and receive text messages, and give advice and directions. The only limit on the types of apps you will learn to build is your own imagination!
However, computer science is not just about coding and building apps. We will also learn some of  the fundamental principles of computer science. We'll learn about the potential and the limitations of computing and coding. We'll learn how the Internet works and about the positive and negative aspects of computing in today's society, and much more!
For these broader computing concepts we will work within an emerging curricular framework -- the Computer Science Principles (CSP). The CSP framework is being developed by leading computer science educators from around the country under the auspices of the College Board and with funding support of the National Science Foundation.
In addition to programming and CSP the course is project-based and emphasizes writing, communication, and creativity. Multiple-choice questions, in the style that students can expect to encounter on the AP exam, will also be a key component of this course.How to design and create Android mobile apps using App Inventor

How do artists create visual effects? In order to create an artistic impression, artists select materials that allow image formation, and that lend color, emphasis, shape, and size to the object created.
A scientist might follow up by asking, why those materials?  What characteristics do they have that allow them to embody the artist’s intent? How durable are they? Will they maintain the same qualities, both physical and aesthetic, they had when the work left the studio?
Conservation science further notes that all materials deteriorate over time, and then asks a follow-up question: What physical interventions are possible to maintain, preserve and protect the work as the artist intended? Whatever is done to the art object, the result must be to make the work recognizable as the artist’s work or the result is a failure.  
That is a key goal of this course: to understand, from a chemical point of view, how conservation protocols and the material aspects of an art work allow a better appreciation of an artwork and its creation, as well as confidence that it is the artist’s work.
These are not new problems. According to Leonardo da Vinci, the study of art should include the following topics:
A knowledge of materials
The chemistry of colors
The mathematics of composition
The laws of perspective
The illusions of chiaroscuro
As the briefest study of Leonardo's life shows, he was clearly ahead of his time in wanting to understand the reasons for a vast array of natural and artificial phenomena. Even so, a thorough understanding of those subjects listed above still escapes us today – but, progress has been made and that progress is at once the subject matter and the goal of this course.

Broadly speaking, functional programming is a style of programming in which the primary method of computation is the application of functions to arguments. Among other features, functional languages offer a compact notation for writing programs, powerful abstraction methods for structuring programs, and a simple mathematical basis that supports reasoning about programs.
Functional languages represent the leading edge of programming language design, and the primary setting in which new programming concepts are introduced and studied. All contemporary programming languages such as Hack/PHP, C#, Visual Basic, F#, C++, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java, Scala, Clojure, Groovy, Racket, … support higher-order programming via the concept of closures or lambda expressions.
This course will use Haskell as the medium for understanding the basic principles of functional programming. While the specific language isn't all that important, Haskell is a pure functional language so it is entirely appropriate for learning the essential ingredients of programming using mathematical functions. It is also a relatively small language, and hence it should be easy for you to get up to speed with Haskell.
Once you understand the Why, What and How that underlies pure functional programming and learned to “think like a fundamentalist”, we will apply the concepts of functional programming to “code like a hacker” in mainstream programming languages, using Facebook’s novel Hack language as our main example. This course assumes no prior knowledge of functional programming, but assumes you have at least one year of programming experience in a regular programming language such as Java, .NET, Javascript or PHP.

Le théâtre classique du 17e siècle passe pour le sommet de l’art du théâtre en France. Ses trois représentants les plus connus, Corneille et Racine pour la tragédie et Molière pour la comédie comptent parmi les plus grands dramaturges européens de tous les temps, et Molière reste l’un des auteurs les plus joués dans le monde.
Pour vous les faire découvrir, nous vous emmènerons dans l’environnement historique, sociologique, culturel et littéraire qui les a vu naître. Nous retracerons ainsi l’histoire du "théâtre moderne" depuis sa naissance au milieu du 16e siècle jusqu’aux plus brillantes années du "siècle de Louis XIV"(2e moitié du 17e siècle).
Nous examinerons ainsi les fondements de l’expression "théâtre classique," les fondements du système qui a vu naître les "règles classiques," les fondements d’un dialogue théâtral qui repose entièrement sur "l’alexandrin classique." Et nous ferons apparaître les tensions créatrices (entre la théorie et la pratique, entre les règles et le refus des règles, entre le texte et le spectacle, entre le classicisme et le baroque, entre la tragédie et l’opéra) qui ont façonné le théâtre de cette période.
Enfin, en vous accompagnant dans la lecture des quelques chefs-d’œuvre qui ont créé une rupture esthétique et marqué les esprits, nous vous ferons pénétrer avec nous dans l’atelier créateur des plus grands dramaturges de l’âge d’or du théâtre français.
Pièces de théâtre à lire: Le Cid et Cinna de Corneille / Les Précieuses ridicules, L’École des femmes et Tartuffe de Molière / Andromaque et Phèdre de Racine.
Ces textes sont tous disponibles en éditions de poche (choisir de préférence "Folio classique” et "Folio Théâtre" ou "Le Livre de poche Classique.") 
Nous vous invitons à découvrir avec nous d’où viennent ces trois auteurs, comment ils se sont construits, comment ils se sont distingués des plus brillants dramaturges de leur temps. Et nous vous montrerons quels sont les ingrédients qui ont permis à leurs œuvres d’avoir été sans cesse lues et jouées jusqu’à aujourd’hui — et cela, alors même que de nombreux éléments-clés (l’obéissance à des "règles" et l’usage du vers dit "alexandrin," en particulier) ont disparu depuis longtemps.

DNA encodes our genetic information and is passed on within cells to maintain living organisms and to produce the next generation. The recognition of DNA as the genetic material and the ensuing identification of its structure and coding mechanism were both revolutionary and foundational.  These discoveries led to transformational integration across the biological sciences with a common understanding of this fundamental unit of life! Join this exploration of DNA structure, packaging, replication, and manipulation.
The course utilizes video lectures, research articles, case studies, and molecular models to convey information. The course grade will be based on questions with each video lecture, quizzes, homework, and a final exam. Methods that identified DNA as the genetic material

This course is divided into three parts. First, you’ll learn how the Chinese World Order emerged in the ancient world, focusing on the concept of the "heavenly mandate" (天命) as the ultimate source of political power (1 module). You’ll also learn how the Chinese World Order expanded into the relationship between China and surrounding political entities (1 module) and several challenges when the Qing (淸) Empire replaced the Ming (明) Empire.
Second, this course will review how China tried to project its world order into the relationship with Korea and Korea came to be integrated into the Chinese World Order from the 14th century to the 18th century (4 modules). More specifically, it will show how China intervened in the interstate trade and Korean music. 
Finally, it will compare the two trajectories of political thoughts between Korea and Japan since 17th century. Korea fantasized itself as the genuine heir and center of the Chinese World Order, closing its door to foreigners. Meanwhile, Japan overcame the Chinese World Order and eventually converted itself as a modern state (1 module).

Over thirty years ago, confident in the superiority of American military power, the United States set out to "fix" the Greater Middle East. Since that time, U.S. troops, covert operatives and proxies have engaged in costly exertions in predominantly Muslim societies everywhere from the Levant and the Persian Gulf to East Africa and Central Asia. With what result? Washington's efforts have exacted a terrible toll, squandering vast amounts of blood and treasure. In the meantime, the Islamic world has become less stable while anti-American radicalism flourishes. America’s War for the Greater Middle East has failed, and that failure is irreversible.
This course offers a history of that war, for better understanding of the factors that inspired the United States to launch the conflict and to persist in a doomed enterprise. Inviting you to learn how the war unfolded from one phase to the next, from the era of Jimmy Carter to the age of Barack Obama, it catalogs the errors of judgment and implementation made along the way. Finally, it encourages you to consider alternative approaches to policy that might have better served the interests of the United States and of the people living in countries invaded, occupied, bombed and otherwise subjected to American punishment.

Love letters generated by a computer. An online poem two hundred trillion stanzas long. A mystery novel in the form of a wiki. The story of Inanimate Alice, told through videos and instant messages. An ocean buoy tweeting remixes of Moby Dick. Welcome to the weird world of electronic literature—digitally born poetic, narrative, and aesthetic works read on computers, tablets, and phones. Experimental, evocative, and sometimes simply puzzling, electronic literature challenges our assumptions about reading, writing, authorship, and meaning.
Yet e-lit, as it is often called, has also profoundly influenced mainstream culture. Literature, film, comics, apps, and video games have all learned lessons from electronic literature. This course will trace the rise of electronic literature and explore both historic and contemporary works of e-lit. We’ll begin with electronic literature’s roots in avant-garde art and Cold War technology, and follow e-lit through the birth of the personal computer into the era of the Web and smartphone. At every step along the way the expressive power of new media—the way digital media enables and shapes different modes of creative and cultural expression—will be of particular interest to us.The history of creative computing

As modern life science research becomes ever more quantitative, the need for mathematical modeling becomes ever more important. A deeper and mechanistic understanding of complicated biological processes can only come from the understanding of complex interactions at many different scales, for instance, the molecular, the cellular, individual organisms and population levels.
In this course, through case studies, we will examine some simplified and idealized mathematical models and their underlying mathematical framework so that we learn how to construct simplified representations of complex biological processes and phenomena. We will learn how to analyze these models both qualitatively and quantitatively and interpret the results in a biological fashion by providing predictions and hypotheses that experimentalists may verify.
当现代生命科学研究变得更加量化，建立数学模型的需求变得越来越重要。对复杂生物现象的深入理解最终是建立在了解发生于多时空间尺度的复杂生物学相互作用上，例如，分子尺度，细胞尺度，个体和群体尺度上。通过研究一些案例，我们将建立一些简化的数学模型以及其背后的基本数学框架。同时，我们将学习如何建立基本生物学过程的简单表征，以及如何定量和定性和定量地的分析这些模型，并将它们的结果以生物学的方式进行解释，以期提供实验学家进行检验的假说和预测。How to construct simplified representations of biological processes and phenomena

What causes a country’s debt to become unsustainable? How do we assess debt sustainability of public and external debt? How can countries manage their debt portfolio?
This online course aims to provide a comprehensive overview of debt sustainability analysis (DSA) and a medium-term debt management strategy framework adopted by the IMF and the World Bank.
Specifically, the course will: (i) introduce the main principles of debt sustainability; (ii) cover recently updated DSA frameworks — both for advanced and emerging markets and for low-income countries — with an emphasis on country data; (iii) present a medium-term debt management strategy (MTDS) framework; and (iv) illustrate debt sustainability analysis under uncertainty.
Whether you have a professional interest in debt sustainability or debt management or you are simply curious about these issues, we hope that you will join us in this in-depth study of one of the most critical and current issues in economic policy today!

Robots today move far too conservatively, using control systems that attempt to maintain full control authority at all times. Humans and animals move much more aggressively by routinely executing motions which involve a loss of instantaneous control authority. Controlling nonlinear systems without complete control authority requires methods that can reason about and exploit the natural dynamics of our machines.

This course introduces nonlinear dynamics and control of underactuated mechanical systems, with an emphasis on computational methods. Topics include the nonlinear dynamics of robotic manipulators, applied optimal and robust control and motion planning. Discussions include examples from biology and applications to legged locomotion, compliant manipulation, underwater robots, and flying machines.
FAQ
Who can register for this course?
Unfortunately, learners from Iran, Sudan, Cuba and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time.
While edX has received a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to offer courses to learners from Iran and Sudan our license does not cover this course.
Separately, EdX has applied for a license to offer courses to learners in the Crimea region of Ukraine, but we are awaiting a determination from OFAC on that application.
We are deeply sorry the U.S. government has determined that we have to block these learners, and we are working diligently to rectify this situation as soon as possible. </description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>927</course_id><title>The Civil War and Reconstruction - 1850-1861: A Nation Divided</title><published_date>2015-08-20T12:14:35-04:00</published_date><course_length>10 weeks</course_length><effort>6-8 hours per week</effort><subject>History</subject><price>FREE

A House Divided: The Road to Civil War, 1850-1861 begins by examining how generations of historians have explained the crisis of the Union.  After discussing the institution of slavery and its central role in the southern and national economies, it turns to an account of the political and social history of the 1850s. It traces how the issue of the expansion of slavery came to dominate national politics, and how political leaders struggled, unsuccessfully, to resolve the growing crisis. We will examine the impact of key events such as Bleeding Kansas, the Dred Scott decision, the Lincoln-Douglas debates, and John Brown’s raid on Harper’s Ferry, and end with the dissolution of the Union in the winter of 1860-61.
This course is part of the X Series, Civil War and Reconstruction, which introduces students to the most pivotal era in American history. The Civil War transformed the nation by eliminating the threat of secession and destroying the institution of slavery. It raised questions that remain central to our understanding of ourselves as a people and a nation – the balance of power between local and national authority, the boundaries of citizenship, and the meanings of freedom and equality. This X Series will examine the causes of the war, the road to secession, the conduct of the Civil War, the coming of emancipation, and the struggle after the war to breathe meaning into the promise of freedom for four million emancipated slaves. One theme throughout the series is what might be called the politics of history – how the world in which a historian lives affects his or her view of the past, and how historical interpretations reinforce or challenge the social order of the present.

“I recently took your MOOC course "Reconciliation through Indigenous Education", and it changed my practice and lit a fire in me.”
Kristin, Previous IndEdu200x Participant
This course will help you envision how Indigenous ways of knowing, content, perspectives, and pedagogies can be made part of classrooms, schools, and communities in ways that are thoughtful and respectful. This is an approach that more and more educators see as far more likely to ensure the success of Indigenous learners, as well as enhance the learning experiences of all students.
Choosing reconciliation as a lens for rethinking policy and learning practices acknowledges that there are contradictions in the current curriculum of schooling that impact the success of Indigenous learners. Reconciliation in this course emphasizes changing institutional structures and personal and professional ideologies to create equitable and inclusive learning environments for Indigenous learners, and where all students should have opportunities to learn from Indigenous histories, traditions, and knowledges as part of a social justice education.
Educators need to be able to respond to educational reforms that prioritize improved educational outcomes for Indigenous learners. In addition, educators must build the capacity of all learners to engage in relationships with Indigenous peoples based on intercultural understanding, empathy, and respect. To support these goals, teachers, administrators, young people, school staff, community-based organizations, and researchers will learn from Indigenous Elders, educational leaders, and culturally relevant learning resources as part of their experiences in this MOOC.Explore personal and professional histories and assumptions in relation to Indigenous peoples, histories, and worldviews
Develop awareness and knowledge of the colonial histories and current realities of Indigenous peoples
Engage with Indigenous worldviews and perspectives that contextualize and support your understanding of the theory and practices of Indigenous education
Explore a range of educational experiences shared by educators and through teaching exemplars that support the inclusion of Indigenous perspectives and approaches to learning in schools and classrooms
Develop strategies to engage Indigenous families and community members in classrooms and schools

This water sustainability course (PH242x) from Tufts University focuses on the engineering and public health components needed to achieve the conservation of safe water locally and globally. Together, we will explore how to create sustainable interventions geared towards improving population health.
This course provides an interdisciplinary framework for understanding the place of water in health policy and engineering by delving into the complex social, economic, political and scientific factors that influence how we approach these critical health and water related challenges. 
We identify threats to our water supply, including climate change, urbanization, agriculture and emerging contaminants. We lead a water sampling field trip and analyze the results in order to understand how water quality is assessed and regulated. We learn how to conduct a “Risk Assessment” as it relates to human and environmental health. The class will debate about issues such as water privatization, social and environmental justice and hydrofracturing. We’ll learn about point of use interventions for local interventions and take a field trip to the massive Massachusetts Water Resources Authority to see firsthand how large scale interventions are built and managed. Lastly, we will learn about various anthological determinants that drive the sustainability of interventions, review strategies for water management in developing and developed countries, and discuss the opportunities and challenges with implementing these solutions.
In addition to lectures hosted by Tufts Professors Dr. David M. Gute and Dr. Jeffrey K. Griffiths, the course features field trips, and guest lecturers comprised of renowned water professionals, entrepreneurs and scientists from the fields of public health, engineering, environmental science and health policy.
We hope that your ability to conceptualize and address water-related issues will advance as a result of the lecture content, in class demonstrations and global dialogues. To achieve this goal, we strongly encourage active participation and discussion with the professors, students and water professionals from across the globe. 
Lastly, check out the content from The Biology of Water and Health – Fundamentals (PH241x), an archived course that provides a provocative introduction to topics such as the vital role of sanitation and hygiene, waterborne diseases, environmental epidemiology, and water contaminants.

Learn the basics of F# syntax in this programming course from the experts at Microsoft, and begin your journey into the world of functional and modular programming.
Why learn F#? F# is about getting things done. The language has been attractive to groups working in finance and math-intensive disciplines but it broadens the ability of any developer to correctly express more powerful programming ideas in a safer way. So regardless of your programming background, learning F# can help make you a more effective programmer.
The first part of this course provides the groundwork and fundamentals necessary to build functional applications. It will provide a framework of functional programming concepts by giving the student clear examples and the opportunity to practice writing code using those concepts. The course will also provide you with the basics of F# syntax and the core features of the language.
The second part of this course will dive deeper into the more advanced concepts of F# such as concurrency, integration with other languages, type providers, and agents. By the end of this two-part course you will have a solid foundation in functional programming with F#.
To be successful in this course, you should have an understanding of fundamental programming concepts. Knowing the basics of program flow, conditionals, and loops will provide a good foundation for the concepts taught in this course. There are a number of excellent resources available on edX and Microsoft Virtual Academy to help you pick up those skills before jumping in.
We look forward to spending the next few weeks with you helping you explore and understand F#.Functional programming and its concepts through example and practice.

Terrorism has gone from a persistent yet marginal security concern to one of the most important security problems of our day. There are few countries that do not suffer from some form of terrorism. Though many attempts at terrorism fail, some groups wage lengthy and bloody campaigns and, in exceptional cases, kill hundreds or even thousands in pursuit of their ends.
  This course on terrorism will explore the nuances involved in defining terrorism, the nature of Al Qaeda, Hamas, the Islamic State, and other important groups, the effectiveness of different counterterrorism tools like detention and military force, linkages (or the lack thereof) between terrorism and world religions like Islam, terrorist recruiting, counterterrorism and the rule of law, the political context in South Asia and the Middle East, and the terrorist use of technology.Recall the working definitions of terrorism and recognize their analytic limits
Identify a range of causes of terrorism and, as importantly, understand what commonly cited issues are not usually causes
Understand the strategies and tactics of terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda, Hamas, and the Islamic State
Identify important terrorist groups in the Middle East and South Asia with an understanding of their strengths, weaknesses, and overall effectiveness. These include Palestinian groups, Pakistani groups, and Al-Qaeda

Information Technology (IT) is everywhere. Every aspect of human activity depends on it. All IT processes, whether they drive mobile phones, the Internet, transportation systems, enterprise systems, publishing, social networks or any other application, rely on software.
In this new and improved version of the course, you will learn to write software with a progressive hint system for first time programmers. The core skill is programming; not just the ability to piece together a few “lines of code,” but writing quality programs, which will do their job right, and meet the evolving needs of their users. Anyone can write a program; this course teaches you to write good programs.
The course starts from the basics of computing and takes you through a tour of modern object-oriented programming, including classes, objects, control structures, inheritance, polymorphism, and genericity.
Throughout the course, you will have the opportunity to learn the principles of programming as well as the techniques for designing correct and reliable programs by using the Eiffel programming language and notation. You will be trying out example problems to provide your solution, and see it immediately compiled and tested from within your browser. To this end, we are using the Codeboard;web-based IDE, developed at the Chair of Software Engineering (ETH Zurich). 
Beyond programming, you will also get a glimpse at theoretical computer science, the set of mathematical techniques that underlie computation and makes today’s IT-based world possible.
In this third edition of the course we specifically focus on helping students with little or no programming experience. To this end, we have improved the introductory material about the Eiffel language, and we have implemented a progressive hint system students can use to get guidance on how to solve the programming exercises.
"Really good course. Followed it with a couple of experienced colleagues all of them having a computer science background. They really liked the concepts and programming in Eiffel a lot. Many thanks to the team making this course available! Can not wait to start with the advanced course!" --Previous CAMSx Participant

化学与社会课程的授课对象是非科学类本科生，课程的内容涵盖了化学基础和应用的诸多方面。本课程的目标是：培养和提高非科学类学生的科学素养，使学生掌握一些基本的化学知识，对化学家思考问题、解决问题的方法有所了解，拓展学生的视野和知识面，理解当今人类社会所面临的若干重大挑战与化学之间的关联，进而有助于学生自身的职业发展。
化学与社会的主要内容包括化学基本概念、有机化学、高分子化学、材料化学、环境化学、地球化学、能源化学、生物化学、食品化学、医药化学和日用化学等。在课程的开始阶段，将简要介绍一些基本的化学概念和常识，然后依次介绍化学的一些重要分支以及它们在社会生活中的广泛应用。
化学起源于古老的神秘主义。东方道家和西方炼金术士们在追求长生不老和无尽财富的过程中奠定了实验化学的基础，发展出一套比较系统的化学实验方法和设备。尽管金丹术士们没有实现他们最初的目标，但是他们却取得了一个更为伟大的成就，那就是化学作为一门科学诞生了。
化学以理论和实验为基础，面向广阔的应用领域，经过三百多年的发展，已经成为人类文明的支柱学科。回顾人类发展史，几乎每个文明时期的标志性进展都与化学家的贡献密切相关。冶铁技术、人工合成氨技术、橡胶和塑料的合成以及纳米材料都最先出自化学家之手，因此毫不夸张地讲，化学是人类文明的基石。
化学与社会这门课的目的不是培养化学家，而是介绍化学及其成就，描述这门学科的过去、现在和未来。因此，这门课程就像是一艘“观光飞船”，带着同学们俯瞰这片神奇的领域，沿途领略化学中最具代表性的区域。通过学习化学与社会，学生不仅仅可以学到一些基本的化学知识，也可以对化学学科的历史和现状、化学与社会的关系、目前化学领域的某些热点问题以及化学的未来前景有一个轮廓式的了解。

Teaching object non-scientific and social class undergraduate chemistry curriculum, course content covers many aspects of basic and applied chemistry. The objective of this course is to: develop and improve non-science students' scientific literacy so that students have some basic knowledge of chemistry, chemists thinking, problem solving understanding, expand their horizons and knowledge, understanding today Several major challenges facing human society association between the chemical and, thereby contribute to students' own career development.
The main content of the chemical and the basic concepts of society, including chemical, organic chemistry, polymer chemistry, materials chemistry, environmental chemistry, geochemistry, energy, chemistry, biochemistry, food chemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry and household chemistry. At the beginning of the course, will briefly introduce some basic concepts and knowledge of chemistry, followed by some important branches of chemistry, and they are widely used in social life.
Chemical originated in ancient mysticism. East and West Taoist alchemists in pursuit of immortality and endless wealth in the process laid the foundation for chemistry experiments, to develop a more systematic method and apparatus for chemical experiments. Although saver warlocks do not realize their initial goal, but they made one more great achievement, it is a chemical used as a science was born.
Chemistry with theoretical and experimental basis for the broad application areas, after three hundred years of development, has become a pillar disciplines of human civilization. Recalling the history of human development, almost iconic during the progress of each civilization are closely related to the contribution of chemists. Metal fabrication technology, artificial ammonia technology, synthetic rubber and plastics and nano materials are first hand from the chemist, and therefore no exaggeration to say that the chemical is a cornerstone of human civilization.
The purpose of this course is not the culture and society of chemical chemist, but describes the chemical and its achievements, describing the discipline's past, present and future. Therefore, this course is like a "tourist spaceship", with students overlook this magical area, along a taste of the chemical in the most representative area. Through the study of chemistry and society, students can not only learn some basic knowledge of chemistry, the relationship can be the history and status quo of chemistry, chemical and society, current and future prospects of some hot issues in the field of chemistry and the chemical has a contour Formula understanding.人文和社科类学生的化学课程

In these modules you will learn about the interaction of radiation with atoms: resonance; absorption, stimulated and spontaneous emission; methods of resonance, dressed atom formalism, masers and lasers, cavity quantum electrodynamics; structure of simple atoms, behavior in very strong fields; fundamental tests: time reversal, parity violations, Bell's inequalities; and experimental methods.
Completing the five-course sequence allows you to pursue advanced study and research in cold atoms, as well as specialized topics in condensed matter physics.
  FAQ
Who can register for this course?
Unfortunately, learners from Iran, Cuba, Sudan and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time. While edX has received a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to offer courses to learners from Iran and Sudan our license does not cover this course.
Separately, EdX has applied for a license to offer courses to learners in the Crimea region of Ukraine, but we are awaiting a determination from OFAC on that application. We are deeply sorry the U.S. government has determined that we have to block these learners, and we are working diligently to rectify this situation as soon as possible.

En el caso de la escuela, el fenómeno de la violencia se ha incrementado de manera significativa en el último tiempo. Sin embargo ¿Cómo afrontar dicha problemática?
Frente al carácter limitado que poseen las estrategias de tipo restringido que plantean soluciones remediales desde enfoques de tipo reactivo y punitivo, en este curso se plantea la necesidad de construir estrategias de carácter más amplio que a través de enfoques de tipo preventivo pongan el acento en la promoción del desarrollo de climas de convivencia pacíficos, cuando se comprende el carácter estructural que poseen la génesis y desarrollo de los fenómenos de violencia en la escuela.
Quien se inscriba en este curso podrá adquirir las herramientas teórico-metodológicas para comprender a mayor profundidad el fenómeno y para poder construir estrategias para el diagnóstico y la intervención más pertinentes a fin de hacer frente a los problemas de convivencia que hoy día se viven en las escuelas.El concepto de violencia y su carácter social

Do you want to make a difference by collaborating with other like-minded individuals from around the globe? Maybe you’re already working with a group doing social impact work in an established organization/NGO. Or perhaps you have an idea for a social initiative and want to team up with others, locally or virtually. Or maybe you’re just concerned about the direction the world is heading and want to join a global conversation about creating some positive, sustainable change. If so, this first ever GROOC is for you.
Our GROOC has a distinct pedagogy: we believe profound learning happens when people share their experiences with each other, ask questions and tell stories. It’s called social learning. There are no right or wrong answers and no tests along the way. Instead, you’ll delve into relevant issues that concern all social initiatives, at any stage of development.
Over seven sessions, you will be exposed to concepts and models from our four course designers and will hear from top international scholars and practitioners who combine the best thinking with the most effective doing. Plus, you’ll have access to more than 20 “deep dive” interviews with fascinating individuals who are at the forefront of creating social change, including Muhammad Yunus, Mary Gordon, Marshall Ganz, and many more.
The goal of our GROOC is simple: to inspire the creation of social initiatives that will help rebalance society. Join us to engage in meaningful social learning with a worldwide network of people who want to create a better world together.Work as a high-functioning team (Co-Creating)

“If history is our guide, we can assume that the battle between the intellect and will of the human species and the extraordinary adaptability of microbes will be never-ending.” (1)
Despite all the remarkable technological breakthroughs that we have made over the past few decades, the threat from infectious diseases has significantly accelerated. In this course, we will learn why this is the case by looking at the fundamental scientific principles underlying epidemics and the public health actions behind their prevention and control in the 21st century.
This course covers these four topics:
origins of novel pathogens;
analysis of the spread of infectious diseases;
medical and public health countermeasures to prevent and control epidemics;
panel discussions involving leading public health experts with deep frontline experiences to share their views on risk communication, crisis management, ethics and public trust in the context of infectious disease control.

Urology is the clinical science of diseases within the genitourinary system of males and females. Anatomically it includes diseases in the upper urinary tract like the kidneys and ureters, the lower urinary tract like the urinary bladder and urethra, and the male inner and outer genitals like the prostate, testicles and the epididymis.
 
Many of the symptoms from these organs belong to the top 100 most common symptoms for which patients seek help. This course will set you on a path to a basic understanding of the most common symptoms from the genitourinary system.
You might think that urology merely is a surgical specialty but that opinion couldn’t be more wrong. Today urology is a speciality including numerous new and common non-surgical and pharmacotherapeutic alternatives. Our goal for participants taking this course is to gain knowledge and instill confidence in basic clinical reasoning within the urological field.
 
The course will include clinically relevant cases. 
Please follow us using #KIUrologyXInvestigations and treatment options for some of the most common diagnoses behind the symptoms:
Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) - Symptoms from the lower urinary tract like dysuria, incontinence, weak stream
Hematuria - blood in the urine
Pain and/or lumps in the scrotum
Erectile Dysfunction (ED) - a common condition strongly associated to quality of life in men AND women</description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>955</course_id><title>中国古代史（大学先修课) | Ancient History of China</title><published_date>2015-09-08T15:01:54-04:00</published_date><course_length>14 weeks</course_length><effort>4 - 6 hours/week</effort><subject>History</subject><price>FREE

American politics has all the aspects of drama, but it has real meaning for people’s everyday lives.
What are the foundations of the U.S. political system? How do leading institutions such as the presidency and Congress operate? Where do public opinion, political parties, groups, and the media fit in? What explains America’s economic, social, and foreign policies?
If exploring these questions interests you, then this is the course for you. This course is an introduction to the U.S. government that draws on political science and cases—such as the Iraq invasion and health care reform—to explain how the U.S. government system works.
No previous study of American politics needed. Join us on a journey into the heart of the U.S. governing system. This course is ideal for:
College and advanced placement high school students looking for an introduction to American government.
U.S.-based political science and government teachers looking for a way to augment their own courses.
Global teachers and educators looking to explain the American political system to their students and citizens.
Citizens in the U.S. and abroad who want to understand the workings of the U.S. political system.

As contemporary humans, we are a product of our evolutionary past. That past can be directly observed through the study of the human fossil record, the materials preserved for archaeological study, and the DNA of living and extinct human populations. This course will provide an overview of human evolutionary history from the present--contemporary human variation in a comparative context--through our last common ancestor with the living great apes, some 5-7 million years in the past. Emphasis will be placed on major evolutionary changes in the development of humans and the methodological approaches used by paleoanthropologists and related investigators to develop that knowledge.
The course will begin by asking basic questions about how evolution operates to shape biological variation and what patterns of variation look like in living humans and apes. We will then look at how the human lineage first began to differentiate from apes, the rise and fall of the Australopithecines, the origin and dispersal of the genus Homo, and eventually the radical evolutionary changes associated with the development of agricultural practices in the past 15,000 years. Throughout the course students will be exposed to the primary data, places and theories that shape our understanding of human evolution.How the forces of evolution shape patterns of biological variation

This course will explore Upton Sinclair’s 1906 novel The Jungle, which portrays the exploitation of immigrants in the industrial USA of the early 20th century. However, this novel is most remembered for its depiction of health violations and unclean conditions in the American meatpacking industry.

These findings were based on an investigation Sinclair did as a journalist..  Sinclair spent several weeks gathering information while working in the meatpacking plants of the Chicago stockyards for the newspaper Appeal to Reason. The Jungle was first published in serial form in 1905 in the newspaper. A film version of the novel was made in 1914, but it has been lost.

The novel highlights working class poverty, the lack of social support, harsh living and working conditions, and a bleak outlook for the working poor. This is contrasted with the corruption of those in power.

Participants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion. Course materials will include background information for understanding the text, as well as vocabulary and language support. Assessment will include quizzes and short writing assignments.Read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence

You need to be smart to begin a PhD - but you need to be resilient to finish one. Between one-quarter and one-third of all research students never finish their degree. The PhD is an emotional journey as much as it is an intellectual one.
What kinds of emotions does the research degree process provoke? What strategies can help students deal with the emotional highs and lows? How can academic advisors, family and friends help research students cope with these stresses - and celebrate the successes?
This course is primarily designed for masters, PhD, and research students and the academics who are tasked with helping them, but you may also be a family member or friend of a PhD student who is seeking to better understand what your loved one is going through.
By directly addressing the emotional issues, and by helping us see the connections between emotional resilience and success, this course aims to help us all create a more supportive academic environment, where students can do their best research work. Understand the common emotional experiences of research students and why they tend to have emotional issues in common.
Discuss and create strategies and approaches to help research students cope with the emotional challenges of research study.
Help academics and prospective academics become more effective research supervisors.</description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>965</course_id><title>Introduction to Sociology</title><published_date>2015-05-21T10:26:18-04:00</published_date><course_length>6 weeks</course_length><effort>4-6 hours/week</effort><subject>Social Sciences</subject><price>FREE

Very often we see, hear or experience things that seem "strange" and incomprehensible to us. We start to wonder about the world around us, asking questions like: “How do certain people become billionaires when others are homeless? Why do humans worship Gods or form families? What makes killing in war acceptable but not in any other situation?”
If you have ever wondered about these issues and/or other, you aren’t alone. Similar questions have been asked since the beginning of history, and searching for objective answers using scientific research is the goal of sociology. 
This course is designed to look critically and analytically through different sociological perspectives, including the functionalist, interactionist, conflict and feminist, to help us realize the extent to which society guides our thoughts and actions. The course material provides a fresh, new look at societies and cultures—more objective, full of inquiry and analysis, striving towards social justice and change. Sociology urges us to draw connections between public issues and personal problems, to see the strange as familiar and the familiar as strange, and to examine biography in a historical and social context.
Issues of inequalities, social class, race, sexual orientation, disability, age and gender are critically examined within a global perspective in this course. You do not need any prior knowledge of sociological theories or methods to take this class.  Bring your life experiences and knowledge, and see how the Sociological Imagination will allow you to dispel cultural myths and reframe reality.

This course will cover topics found on the CLEP Sociology exam.Sociological perspectives to critically assess commonly held assumptions.
Global perspectives on cultural diversity and interconnectedness.
Inequalities, including race, gender, sexual orientation, age, and class.
Institutions within the local, national and international arena. </description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>966</course_id><title>Introduction to Bioelectricity</title><published_date>2015-07-13T11:36:40-04:00</published_date><course_length>16 weeks</course_length><effort>4 - 6 hours/week</effort><subject>Engineering</subject><price>FREE

Developing software for one market, and shipping it internationally with a few tweaks is simply impossible. Learn how to  create “world-ready” software from expert programmers who have developed international software for some of the world’s most successful companies.
Developing international software involves far more than translating the User Interface. You must sharpen your business acumen to determine whether shipping software to a specific market is even worth the effort. You must deepen your knowledge of cultural differences so you don’t include a feature, visual, or turn of phrase that offends potential customers. You must understand that differences in language affect input methods, sorting orders, text layout, fonts, and dialog box sizes, and that countries use different currency symbols, number formats, keyboard layouts, and measurement systems--and you should internalize all of this before you write a single line of code.
In this era of rapid development and intense competition, it is tempting to focus on what’s “most important” first, leaving the rest for later; but waiting until the end of the software development cycle to start thinking about markets outside of your own is a strategy that can result in delays or embarrassing failures, costing you time and money, alienating potential customers, and damaging your brand.
In this course, programmers who have developed international software for some of the world’s most successful companies will teach you the secrets to creating a “world-ready” software design and codebase that will make shipping software to markets around the world a smoother, less expensive, and less time-consuming process. The course has three discrete sections: business considerations, design, and development.
No previous programming knowledge is necessary for Part 1. Parts 2 and 3 require an understanding of basic coding techniques.The importance of globalizing software
The process of making the business case for “world ready” software

Have you ever wondered about how museum, library, and other kinds of historical or scientific  collections all come together? Or how and why curators, historians, archivists, and preservationists do what they do?
In Tangible Things, you will discover how material objects have shaped academic disciplines and reinforced or challenged boundaries between people. This course will draw on some of the most fascinating items housed at Harvard University, highlighting several to give you a sense of the power of learning through tangible things.
By “stepping onto” the storied campus, you and your fellow learners can explore Harvard’s astonishing array of tangible things—books and manuscripts, art works, scientific specimens, ethnographic artifacts, and historical relics of all sorts. The University not only owns a Gutenberg bible, but it also houses in its collections Turkish sun dials, a Chinese crystal ball, a divination basket from Angola, and nineteenth-century “spirit writing” chalked on a child-sized slate. Tucked away in storage cabinets or hidden in closets and the backrooms of its museums and libraries are Henry David Thoreau’s pencil, a life mask of Abraham Lincoln, and chemicals captured from a Confederate ship. The Art Museums not only care for masterpieces of Renaissance painting but also for a silver-encrusted cup made from a coconut. The Natural History Museum not only preserves dinosaur bones and a fish robot but an intact Mexican tortilla more than a century old.
In the first section of the course, we will consider how a statue, a fish, and a gingham gown have contributed to Harvard’s history, and you will learn the value of stopping to look at the things around you.
In the next section, we will explore some of the ways people have brought things together into purposeful collections to preserve memory, promote commerce, and define culture.
Finally, we will consider methods of rearranging objects to create new ways of thinking about nature, time, and ordinary work.
Along the way, you will discover new ways of looking at, organizing, and interpreting tangible things in your own environment.

This course will explore Bram Stoker’s 1897 classic vampire novel, Dracula, which is famous for introducing the vampire Count Dracula. This is the story of Dracula's move from Transylvania to England to find new blood and spread the curse of the undead. It also introduces the now-famous character of Professor Abraham Van Helsing.

The novel Dracula is categorized in many different ways: vampire, horror, and gothic fiction. It also addresses concepts such as women in Victorian culture, colonialism, sexuality, and post-colonialism. Although Stoker was not the first writer to tell the story of a vampire, he is credited for giving the vampire its modern form. This story has been adapted to many different forms in film and theater.

Participants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion. Course materials will include background information for understanding the text, as well as vocabulary and language support. Assessment will include quizzes and short writing assignments.Read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence

Language is an integral part of society. Wherever we come from, the words we use and the way in which we use them are fundamental to our cultural identity. In today’s increasingly globalised world, however, ‘linguicide’ – the loss of a language – is becoming all too common. But there is hope. The language revival movement has emerged as an important and effective response, and this course will introduce you to its key principles and techniques.
 
After discussing powerful answers to the question of why languages should be revived, we’ll investigate how. Far more than just a simple process of recovering literacy and lost letters, language revival involves a deep and complex engagement with history, human rights, identity and wellbeing. You will also learn what’s being done around the world right now, and how effective these techniques have been.Explore connections between language and identity.

Innovative thinking is one of the top characteristics global businesses look for in their employees. Yet only 1 in 4 of us feel that our creativity is where we want it to be. Why should this surprise us? Almost none of us has ever been taught how to be inventive.
This course is based on an extraordinarily successful program that has been presented at over 70 top American universities. Over the next 5 weeks Dr. Roberta Ness, an internationally renowned physician-scientist and an expert in innovative thinking, provides proven techniques to expand your originality. The method she will teach you is described by the acronym PIG In MuD: Define the problem, identify frames, generate all possible alternatives, incubate, meld to your best ideas, and disseminate. Your mascot will be Eggbert, an uptight, risk-avoidant pig who will learn a thing or two along with you. Along with Eggbert, you will sharpen your powers of observation, making surprising associations, expanding assumptions, pulling questions apart, and thinking backwards. Solving real-world problems in business and science, you will hone your creative thinking skills. In a final group project, you will be amazed by how creative you have become. Since the top projects will be voted up onto the home page and visible to all collaborating companies, you may even come across unique career opportunities when you and your ideas are “discovered.”

La complejidad de los problemas emanados de una rápida globalización de la economía así como  los grandes avances en la tecnología de la información (TI) han acelerado la aparición de sucesivas crisis económicas y sociales en las que tanto gobiernos de muchos países como empresas encuentran dificultades para adaptarse a esta nueva situación  y cambiar con agilidad sus modelos de  gobierno y gestión.

Por otro lado la agresión al medio ambiente y el cambio climático  y  la necesidad de atender los requerimientos  de agentes económicos y sociales reclaman su derecho a desempeñar el rol que les corresponde. Emergen tendencias como la Responsabilidad Social Corporativa, vinculada a procesos de reporte estandarizado, como el que marca Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) y a mejoras en los esquemas de Gobernanza Corporativa, necesarias para armonizar los distintos ecosistemas tanto sociales como empresariales y ambientales garantizando la legítima participación de todas las partes interesadas y equiparando la información generada a la financiera a la hora de tomar decisiones.

En este escenario, los activos utilizados tanto por gobiernos como empresas para desarrollar deben ser administrados de manera eficaz y eficiente para incrementar el valor de las organizaciones de manera incremental y continua garantizando principalmente  la sostenibilidad económico financiera de esas organizaciones. Dentro de esos activos, la información y la TI adquieren valor importantísimo para facilitar  las necesidades de transformación de las organizaciones y, especialmente gobernar y gestionar el uso adecuado de la TI tal como señala la norma ISO/IECE 38500.

En cualquier caso, la implantación de éstas  tecnologías requiere un cambio profundo en la cultura de las organizaciones, públicas y privadas y la adopción de principios y políticas internas que impidan posibles perjuicios a todas las partes interesadas en el éxito de dichas organizaciones.

La aplicación de las distintas normas mencionadas así como  renovación del concepto de Gobernanza Corporativa aplicada a los distintos activos y especialmente a la TI (dirección y control en el uso y gestión de los mismos) es uno de los grandes retos a los que se enfrenta hoy el mundo económico financiero así como la generación de conocimiento e inteligencia para resolver los graves problemas de nuestros días y en el futuro. Esta nueva forma de trabajar hará que las empresas sean más responsables, comprometidas, humanas,  productivas, y más eficaces y eficientes en el liderazgo, formación y aptitud personal así como un uso adecuado de la TI por parte de la organización. </description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>981</course_id><title>Sabermetrics 101: Introduction to Baseball Analytics</title><published_date>2015-02-18T23:21:14-05:00</published_date><course_length>10 weeks</course_length><effort>6-8 hours</effort><subject>Data Analysis &amp; Statistics</subject><price>FREE

This course will cover the theory and the fundamentals of the emerging science of Sabermetrics. We will discuss the game of baseball, not through consensus or a fan’s conventional wisdom, but by searching for objective knowledge in baseball performance. These and other areas of sabermetrics will be analyzed and better understood with current and historical baseball data. 
The course also serves as applied introduction to the basics of data science, an emerging field of scholarship, that requires skills in computation, statistics, and communicating results of analyses. Using baseball data, the basics of statistical regression, the R Language, and SQL will be covered.
This course was successfully taught on the edX platform as a MOOC in 2014. This course has also been successfully taught at the Experimental College at Tufts University since 2004.  Many of its former students have gone on to careers writing about baseball and working in various MLB baseball operations and analytics departments.The basics of data science, and how it applies to the study of baseball

This course will provide fundamental knowledge in immunology as well as some advanced topics from cutting-edge research results, such as cancer immunotherapy and novel vaccine development.
 
Immunity is the body’s system of protection from attack by pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. Immunology has a long history, and researchers around the world faced with the “enemies of human life” have solved numerous immunological mysteries, and contributed to a paradigm shift in immunology. Nonetheless, it is as yet unknown how certain diseases like AIDS, influenza and allergies can be completely conquered. The latest immunological research is revealing that immunity is also strongly correlated with an increasing number of other diseases such as cancer, arteriosclerosis and diabetes. If we could fully understand the mechanism of immunity, we should be able to treat such diseases. We would like to introduce basic knowledge of immunology revealed by past research and share our insights on the latest findings with you for the future development of immunology.
 
During this course you will learn the mechanisms of the immune system and deepen your understanding of forefront immunology research and development of medical applications.  We especially encourage young people who are interested in life-science and immunology to join this course, as it will assist consideration of immunology research as a career.
 
The part one of the course consists of 5 lectures of about 90 minutes each.
The first week covers introductory subjects and specific topics follow from the second week.
 
Program :
Week 1. Introduction: Overview of immunology
Week 2. Innate immunity
Week 3. Acquired immunity 1
Week 4. Acquired immunity 2

Far too frequently, the people who have the most to say have the hardest time saying it. Many of the best minds in our society, our most talented employees and our most promising students, fail to have the impact they could because of ineffective strategies for communicating their ideas and insights to others.
This five-week refresher is geared toward experts (scientists, engineers, and other technical professionals) and will help them effectively communicate with non-scientists, usually management, to inform organizational decision-making.
Join us as we examine and learn the essential components of communication strategy.Review communications skills
Though many students learn communications skills early in their academic career, they may have not practiced, or may have forgotten, many useful communications tactics. Additionally, by the time these students begin to develop expertise in specific disciplines and begin working in certain industries, the communication needs become specialized and more challenging.
Help experts assess the value of communication and gain confidence in their abilities
Some people don't want to communicate. They don't feel it is their job. They want to focus on their own technical areas of expertise. Perhaps they fear it a little because it is not their "area" or they simply dismiss it as unimportant. Either way, such beliefs ultimately become constraints on their own success and run counter to the expectations of others who oversee their work.
Help professionals bridge the communication gap
Many people often underestimate how hard it is to effectively communicate and think they do a better job than they actually do. After all, their content makes sense to them, and if someone else doesn't understand, it must be their fault.</description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>985</course_id><title>Media LIT: Overcoming Information Overload</title><published_date>2015-04-24T10:14:42-04:00</published_date><course_length>7 weeks</course_length><effort>3-5 hours/week</effort><subject>Communication</subject><price>FREE

Media literacy helps us understand, analyze and create media. While we rely on good journalism to provide accurate information, we also have responsibilities of our own in this media-saturated environment. We can no longer be passive consumers of media. We need to be active users of media, as readers, listeners, viewers and creators, so we are all better informed. Our goal is to help you do just that.Describe the changes that have transformed the way we create and consume media

Education is increasingly occurring online or in educational software, resulting in an explosion of data that can be used to improve educational effectiveness and support basic research on learning.
In this course, you will learn how and when to use key methods for educational data mining and learning analytics on this data. You will learn about the methods being developed by researchers in the educational data mining, learning analytics, learning at scale, student modeling, and artificial intelligence in education communities, as well as standard data mining methods frequently applied to educational data. You will learn how to apply these methods, and when to apply them, as well as their strengths and weaknesses for different applications.
The course will discuss how to use each method to answer education research questions and to drive intervention and improvement in educational software and systems. Methods will be covered both at a theoretical level, and in terms of how to apply and execute them using software tools like RapidMiner. We will also discuss validity and generalizability; towards establishing how trustworthy and applicable the results of an analysis are.
Some knowledge of either statistics, data mining, mathematical modeling, or algorithms is recommended. Experience with programming is not required.

What is sustainability, and how are we active participants in it? How does our individual ‘ecological footprint’ matter among the billions of humans’ footprints on earth? How are we alike and different in our impacts, depending on where we live; and how does civic and governmental attitude impact sustainability and resilience in the future? These questions will be explored on a global, local and personal level in this introductory course. Students will compare and contrast case studies from suburban Seattle to rural, mountainous China and consider their own significant impacts on ecology.
Together, we will go over the concepts of sustainability and resilience, and analyze your impact on our environment. For a global perspective, we will go over a case study of societal impacts. Our emphasis will be on translating theory to individual impact and comprehension.
No previous knowledge is needed. We welcome your voice and look forward to your participation!
ANTH 378x is the first five weeks of the full course offered by the University of Washington online Integrated Social Science bachelor’s completion degree. To describe how science and the political realm interact to shape our views of sustainability.
To apply critical thinking to evaluate and participate in dialogue that influences our environmental practice.
To apply newly discovered self-knowledge about personal environmental impact to their place in a global community.

Ignorance! provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how people think about unknowns, how they deal with them, and how certain kinds of ignorance are enshrined in cultures and social institutions. Over 5 weeks, we’ll be taking you on a tour through ignorance in all its varieties and guises. Ignorance is everyone’s business. Ignorance is relevant to every discipline and profession, and to everyday life, both at work and at play. No matter what domain you study or work in, this course will have something to offer to you.
We will explore questions about ignorance such as: Where does ignorance come from? How do we impose ignorance on each other, and even on ourselves? And why? We usually think about ignorance as a bad thing, but can it be preferable not to know something? How do we use ignorance? What roles does ignorance play in social interaction, group relations, institutions, and law? Can ignorance sometimes be a virtue?  When can ignorance be good or bad for us? How can we harness the unknown for learning, discovery, and creativity? 
Your understanding of ignorance will be expanded via online games, discussion forums, opportunities to find out what your own “ignorance profile” is, additional readings, and Wiki materials. There also will be discussion threads specifically for those of you who want to apply understandings about ignorance to complex social and environmental problems. Knowing more about ignorance will help you to manage and work with it. It also will help you in dealing with the unexpected, and with complex problems.Different kinds of ignorance

During each week of this course, chefs reveal the secrets behind some of their most famous culinary creations — often right in their own restaurants. Inspired by such cooking mastery, the Harvard team will then explain the science behind the recipe.
Topics will include:
Soft matter materials, such as emulsions, illustrated by aioli
Elasticity, exemplified by the done-ness of a steak
Diffusion, revealed by the phenomenon of spherification, the culinary technique pioneered by Ferran Adrià.
You will also have the opportunity to become an experimental scientist in your very own laboratory — your kitchen. By following along with the engaging recipe of the week, taking precise measurements, and making skillful observations, you will learn to think like both a cook and a scientist. The lab is certainly one of the most unique components of this course — After all, in what other science course can you eat your experiments?

Introduction to Environmental Science, ENVX, was first offered in early 2015.
Environmental science is the study of patterns and processes in the natural world and their modification by human activity.  To understand current environmental problems, we need to consider physical, biological and chemical processes that are often the basis of those problems. This course will give you the skills necessary to address the environmental issues we are facing today by examining scientific principles and the application of those principles to natural systems.  This course will survey some of the many environmental science topics at an introductory level, ultimately considering the sustainability of human activities on the planet.
Environmental impacts on Earth come from the number of people and the amount and types of resources that they use. By applying scientific principles and considering real-world examples, we will examine:
The field of environmental science and how to think like an environmental scientist
The human population and the ways in which changes in the population affect the environment
Agriculture, soils and the environmental implications of eating meat, vegetables, local, organic, sustainable, industrial and other types of food
Non-renewable fossil fuels with a focus on coal, petroleum and natural gas and the benefits and consequences of using each
Renewable fuels such as wind and solar and identify that even renewable “green” energy sources have impacts as well as benefits
Biodiversity and global change, which are the integrating units of environmental science
Education method
The course will utilize video lectures, interviews with experts, readings, discussions, multiple choice and prompted discussions and one graded quiz per week. There will also be several optional live office hours on Google Hangouts.
Completion of self-assessments, contributions to discussion and quiz scores will determine the final grade. How to think like an environmental scientist
How natural systems are affected by people
An appreciation of your own impact on the environment</description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>995</course_id><title>Introduction to Psychology</title><published_date>2015-03-31T11:48:39-04:00</published_date><course_length>10 weeks</course_length><effort>4-5 hours per week</effort><subject>Biology &amp; Life Sciences</subject><price>FREE

Psychology is the academic and applied study of the human mind and behavior. Perhaps there are no more salient topics in the information age and the global economy than a comprehensive understanding of how learning takes place and what predicts and determines human behavior. The course is a primer, meant to provide substantive content through which to understand the human condition and to inspire students to continue their learning and growth.
 
Students interested in the study of psychology are interested in why people do, say and think what they do. They have questions about how learning takes place, how genetics dictate certain traits but not others, how memories are formed, where to draw the line between normality and disorder, whether a damaged brain can regain function and the predictors of addiction.
 
Through this introductory course, students will have the opportunity to understand the science of psychology and how psychologists measure mental function and behavior and how the results are reported. They will better understand perception and consciousness and the mysteries of sleep and dreams. Through child development, they will understand how the brain is ready for learning and pre-wired for language. Motivation, cognition and personality will be analyzed through the lens of past and current psychological thought. Students will understand the statistical reality of the normal distribution and how that is relevant to most traits. They will review new research on the plasticity of the brain and consider whether intelligence is fixed or flexible. Lastly, the array of disorders and dysfunction will be analyzed and discussed and the line between normal and abnormal will be considered.

-Paradiso, Canto II, lines 4-6
Joy is the business of Paradiso, that much is clear; but could there be a more mysterious word in the whole realm of human imagination than “Joy?” “Joy” boggles the human imagination because it asks us to follow the vector of hope to its maximal extension and intention, until it arrives at that point which Dante locates “nel mezzo,” at the very center of everything, at that point where every centripetal and centrifugal force of both the physical universe of energy and the symbolic universe of creative imagination and meaning first arise and finally return.
From beginning to end, the Pilgrim’s progress through Paradiso is enabled and guided by his enactment of the role to which he consented in the climactic episode of the Purgatorio in the garden of the Earthly Paradise. Now leaving Earth behind and beneath, the Pilgrim is transformed into the disciple; specifically, the disciple of Beatrice. She now becomes his true path, la diritta via, along which he gradually discovers the Joy that Christianity identifies as the hope of Resurrection.
Dante’s Paradiso maps the physics of freedom, tracing a universal history of meaning. Just as there is a physics of matter and energy, there is a physics of freedom governing the evolutionary history of hope which directs the human search for meaning in every person’s life and in all human culture. In this universe, meaning functions as does light in the physical universe, acting as its absolute measure and enforcing its most basic law—the law of relational identity, where “all are responsible to all for all.” Like the principle of relativity in the physics of energy, relational identity means that each personal existence has historical reality only in relation to all other personal identities.
Almost everyone agrees that the poetry of the Paradiso is sublime. Sublimity, however, is a highly rarefied and strenuously acquired taste. This is why Dante himself warns us in the second canto of the Paradiso that unless we have become used to eat the “bread of Angels,” we should turn back and not attempt to follow him on this final leg of his journey, and we as modern-day readers might well be tempted here to turn back as the Pilgrim himself was tempted in the second canto of the Inferno. But to paraphrase Virgil’s response then, which both encouraged and challenged, “Why be so afraid to reach for what your heart most hopes for; where else do you have to turn?”
In this course, you will be asked to participate in learning activities on both edX and on MyDante, an innovative platform for deep reading that emphasizes mindfulness and contemplative reading habits
as key to deriving lasting meaning from poetic texts. The pedagogical approach of the course goes beyond mere academic commentary on the poem as literature; it introduces the reader to a way of thinking about the meaning of the poem at a personal level.  This module is the third of three modules that compose the full course. A module on the Vita Nuova and Inferno will launch on October 15, 2014, and a module on Purgatorio will launch in February 2015. This course features Robert and Jean Hollander's contemporary translations of Dante Alighieri's Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso, permission courtesy of The Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, a division of Random House LLC. The print editions contain valuable notes and commentary which are highly recommended as companions to the course materials.

In Paradox and Infinity we will study a cluster of puzzles, paradoxes and intellectual wonders, and discuss their philosophical implications.
The class is divided into three modules:
Time Travel and Free Will: Learn about whether time travel is logically possible, and whether it is compatible with free will.
Infinity: Learn about how some infinities are bigger than others, and explore the mind-boggling hierarchy of bigger and bigger infinities.
Computability and Gödel’s Theorem: Learn about how some mathematical functions are so complex, that no computer could possibly compute them. Use this result to prove Gödel’s famous Incompleteness Theorem.
Bonus: If you sign up to pursue a Verified Certificate for this class, you will be assigned problems that are graded by teaching assistants, and given professional written feedback. This will bring your learning experience one level closer to that of residential students at MIT. If you pass the class, you will receive an MITx certificate, in addition to edX's Verified Certificate of Achievement. </description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>1000</course_id><title>Global Markets and Personal Impacts</title><published_date>2015-03-24T11:28:05-04:00</published_date><course_length>10 weeks</course_length><effort>2-3 hours per week</effort><subject>Communication</subject><price>FREE</price><level>Introductory</level><school>UWashingtonX</school><language>English</language><url>https://www.edx.org/course/global-markets-personal-impacts-uwashingtonx-jsis123x</url><status>Future Dates To Be Announced</status><instructors><instructor><name>Matthew Sparke</name><bio>Professor of Global Health at University of Washington</bio><img>https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/person/image/matthew_sparke.png</img></instructor></instructors><description>This is an Archived Course

This globalization course  focuses on the ways market-led macro-economic reforms associated with globalization (such as free trade agreements and privatization initiatives) have come together with much more micro innovations in how personal behavior is organized by market forces (rethinking education as a personal investment practice, for example, or outsourcing dating to for-profit companies). 
At the end of this course you will be able to:
Describe the main debates and controversies surrounding globalization 
Analyze the ties and tensions of uneven global development
Understand the growing impact of global market integration
Synthesize knowledge of market globalization with your own experiences of market forces and market reforms

While the advances in genomics promise to usher a new era in medical practice and create a major paradigm shift in patient care, the ethical, legal and social impact of genomic medicine will be equally significant. The information and potential use of genomic discoveries are no longer issues left for scientists and medical professionals to handle, but have become ones for the public at large. Rarely a day passes without a genomics-related story reported in the media. By the end of this course, students will be able to better understand the field of genomics; be familiar with various online databases and resources; and understand and appreciate the medical, social, ethical, and legal issues associated with the availability of personal genomic information.
Given the diversity of the topics and the specific expertise required to cover each, this is a unique cross-disciplinary course where faculty from different disciplines including genetics, computational sciences, bioinformatics, genetic counseling, bioethics, law, and business will participate in lecturing. We have assembled a team of experts from various departments at Georgetown University and other institutions, to teach this comprehensive online genomics course.
For a detailed description of the weekly topics, see the course outline.The basics of genetic abnormalities and disease
What we can learn from genetic testing both pre- and post- birth, and in oncology
The basic science behind how the genetic tests are done
The ethical, legal, and social implications of genomic discoveries; the genetic counseling issues; and the new trends in direct-to-consumer marketing of genetic tests

Have you ever wondered about planets in other solar systems? Have you ever thought about the possibility of life elsewhere in the Universe? For the first time in human history, we know that planets around other stars not only exist, but are common!
Alien Worlds focuses on the search and characterization of planets orbiting other stars (called extrasolar planets or “exoplanets”). Over the course of nine modules, we will learn some of the techniques used to discover the thousands of known exoplanets and will discuss how we can use basic scientific tools to characterize the sizes, masses, compositions, and atmospheres of exoplanets. We will also learn about the diversity of stars in the Galaxy to understand how stellar properties affect exoplanet detection techniques and influence planetary formation and habitability.
In addition to the exploration of exoplanets, students in Alien Worlds will gain a basic understanding of light, gravity and motion, and be introduced to some of the most extreme life on planet Earth. We will hear from experts at the forefront of exoplanet science and interact with other participants and instructors through social media and online tools. Students will leave Alien Worlds with a better understanding of their place in the Universe and the skills to comprehend the wealth of new discoveries surrounding the countless worlds around distant stars.How to use basic scientific tools to discover and characterize exoplanets

Everyone experiences adversity and stress at some level, whether it’s the pressure to perform in school or work, relationship problems, financial difficulties, or simply the number of tasks to do in a short period of time. All stress isn’t bad, but chronic stress can take its toll on our minds, bodies, and behavior. Research has shown that people can learn and use specific resilience skills (such as optimistic thinking, relaxation strategies, choosing one’s attention) and positive routines (good sleep, scheduling in fun, and so on) in order to better manage stress, bounce back quicker after a setback, be more effective in their academic and vocational pursuits, develop stronger relationships with others, be physically and mentally healthy, and be satisfied with their lives overall. In short, resilience is ordinary magic and can be learned. It does not necessarily mean that you have to be born resilient or get lucky in life.
The purpose of this course is to teach individuals the science behind becoming a resilient person. Stated simply, resilience is the ability to survive and thrive. Resiliency is not only about your ability to positively adapt in the face of adverse or challenging circumstances (that is, survive), but it is also about learning the positive skills, strategies and routines that enable you to live a happy, fulfilling, and meaningful life (in other words, thrive). This course gives you the permission to take care of yourself in order to effectively manage life stressors and do what matters most in life. 
By the end of this course, you will have learned about the knowledge and skills that you can apply in your life now and in the future to be a resilient person.
Course goal:
The goal for this course is to give you permission to take care of yourself and empower you to be a resilient person. A resilient person is someone who:
purposely strives to be as mentally and psychically healthy as possible,
possesses the confidence to effectively cope with and manage stressful situations,
is compassionate towards self and others,
demonstrates grit or perseverance even in the face of adversity, and
focuses on the positive and fulfilling aspects of life.
Course supporting objectives: When you complete this course, you will be able to:
Describe why ‘functioning from the inside out’ is critical to becoming a resilient, effective person
Explain the benefits of resilience and how the specific skills translate into optimizing social-emotional wellbeing and doing what matters most in life
Directly practice a variety of resilience skills in different aspects of your life, including but not limited to:
Mindfulness practices
Strategies to manage intense emotions
Activities that induce positive emotions
Clarifying important personal values (that is, what matters most) and committing to behaving consistent with them
Making health lifestyle choices that are cheap and readily available, yet promote well-being
Describe why ‘practicing’ and integrating resilience skills into one’s life is critical to making them a habit and becoming a resilient person
Develop a resilience plan that serves as a roadmap for your future </description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>1004</course_id><title>Building Cloud Apps with Microsoft Azure – Part 1</title><published_date>2015-05-14T10:27:42-04:00</published_date><course_length>4 weeks</course_length><effort>4 hours per week</effort><subject>Computer Science</subject><price>FREE

How does the final velocity on a zip line change when the starting point is raised or lowered by a matter of centimeters?  What is the accuracy of a GPS position measurement?  How fast should an airplane travel to minimize fuel consumption? The answers to all of these questions involve the derivative. 
But what is the derivative?  You will learn its mathematical notation, physical meaning, geometric interpretation, and be able to move fluently between these representations of the derivative.  You will discover how to differentiate any function you can think up, and develop a powerful intuition to be able to sketch the graph of many functions.  You will make linear and quadratic approximations of functions to simplify computations and gain intuition for system behavior.  You will learn to maximize and minimize functions to optimize properties like cost, efficiency, energy, and power.

The Bible says that Jesus was identified as God's beloved son at his baptism. The same identification was made about Israel in the Old Testament and the disciples of Christ at their baptism. The striking similarity of these titles establishes a tight interrelationship between the people Israel, the person of Jesus Christ, and the church.
 
In this course, we will explore how a close reading of the book of Genesis, the Gospels, and early Christian writers can shed further light on these relationships and, in so doing, deepen our understanding of the figure of Jesus Christ.  Unlike many other treatments, this course does not presume that Jesus’ character can be plumbed solely by an examination of the Gospel stories. The witness of the Jewish scriptures and the lives of the saints are also important sources for this task.
 
The course will be eight weeks in length and organized around three topical questions:
Who is Israel? (primary source material: the book of Genesis)
Who is Jesus? (primary source material: the Gospels and the Creeds)
Who is the Church? (primary source material: a selection of post-Biblical Christian writers)
 
No matter what your background in the study of theology, this course will provide a fresh approach to the identify of Jesus Christ that will reveal how the church has explored the unmeasurable depths of his person.Recognize major people, places, and events of the Old and New Testament as related to the narratives of Israel and Jesus
Reflect on the mysteries of Christ

In recent years, flying robots such as miniature helicopters or quadrotors have received a large gain in popularity. Potential applications range from aerial filming over remote visual inspection of industrial sites to automatic 3D reconstruction of buildings. Navigating a quadrotor manually requires a skilled pilot and constant concentration. Therefore, there is a strong scientific interest to develop solutions that enable quadrotors to fly autonomously and without constant human supervision. This is a challenging research problem because the payload of a quadrotor is uttermost constrained and so both the quality of the onboard sensors and the available computing power is strongly limited. 
In this course, we will introduce the basic concepts for autonomous navigation for quadrotors. The following topics will be covered:
3D geometry,
probabilistic state estimation,
visual odometry, SLAM, 3D mapping,
linear control.
In particular, you will learn how to infer the position of the quadrotor from its sensor readings and how to navigate it along a trajectory.
The course consists of a series of weekly lecture videos that we be interleaved by interactive quizzes and hands-on programming tasks. For the flight experiments, we provide a browser-based quadrotor simulator which requires the students to write small code snippets in Python.
This course is intended for undergraduate and graduate students in computer science, electrical engineering or mechanical engineering. This course has been offered by TUM for the first time in summer term 2014 on EdX with more than 20.000 registered students of which 1400 passed examination. The MOOC is based on the previous TUM lecture “Visual Navigation for Flying Robots” which received the TUM TeachInf best lecture award in 2012 and 2013.

Homer’s account of the Trojan War in the Iliad explores the effects of warfare upon Greeks and Trojans alike. It illustrates not only the challenges that the combatants faced, but also the plight of innocent victims– women, children, and the elderly. Though the Iliad is often regarded as a kind of Greek national epic, Homer is remarkably even-handed in his treatment of the two sides, even seeming to favor the Trojans over the Greeks at times. He repeatedly emphasizes the horrors of war and his varied descriptions of deaths on the battlefield are unparalleled in both intensity and, paradoxically, poetic charm. The primary objective of warfare in the imaginary time period depicted by Homer is to attain personal glory through acts of individual prowess, with the good of the community seen as a secondary goal.
 
This course explores the idea that war is both universal and particular. The Vietnam War was not the same as the Iraq War. In every war, some things are the same, while some are different. Intense suffering and horrific acts are inevitable. However, the mode of fighting, the resources, the arms, the equipment, the treatment of prisoners, the command structure, and the ideology driving men and women to fight all differ.The causes and contentions of the Trojan War through the eyes of Homer

学这门课需要数学基础吗?
不需要，是算法课，不是数学课。有高中数学知识足矣。
这门课的程序用什么语言编写? 学这门课是否一定要会C++?
课堂的例程都是用C++编写的，要看懂需要一定C++的知识。至于完成作业，用C, C++, Java,Pascal语言都可以。
还是不明白算法到底有什么用。会各种编程语言不就行了吗？
语言只是实现算法的工具。没有好的算法，许多问题，计算机是不能够在人可以接受的时间内计算出结果的。各大IT公司招聘时往往会考察算法，而不是只问你会哪些语言。不会算法，掌握再多种语言，也很难说是一个好的程序员。

The concept of a Smart City holds much promise for improving the quality of life for city dwellers, but what exactly do we mean by “Smart City?” It means aligning information technologies to citizens’ needs in order to enhance their day-to-day lives by increasing efficiency, lowering costs, and engaging more directly with city dwellers. Smart City has emerged as an interdisciplinary concept that covers different aspects related to big cities, including the infrastructure that enables communication between channels and entities for overcoming economic backwardness in a community, and for addressing differences between various urban and suburban zones. A dynamic model is observed that can be analyzed as a complex system. Since a city can´t be visualized in only one perspective, this course tackles some of its individual sectors to obtain the key performance indicators that are essential to improving the quality of life, including: urbanization, communication, education, and economy. Quantifying that data is useful for estimating consumed resources, forecasting shortages, and correcting damage in a timely manner.

Once participants understand the importance of a Smart City and its classifications, they will learn to identify the impact of using metrics to measure its performance. A very important skill to develop is how to classify a metric and to identify its units or measure. The main focus of this course is to develop participants’ basic knowledge of a Smart City by being able to identify the parameters involved in its creation. Participants will also be able to define and establish the necessary metrics to measure the performance of a Smart City.The definition and key elements of a Smart City

WHAT IS “HOW STUFF MOVES”?
Mechanics is the study of how things move. It was the first quantitative science to achieve wide power to predict behavior, including things never before directly observed. Newton, Leibniz, and others invented calculus to describe motion and we will find both differential and integral calculus extremely useful throughout this course.
This is the third in a 3-part series of courses that parallels the second-semester mechanics course taught at Harvey Mudd College. Part 3 focuses on the movement of oscillating systems and the propagation of waves (sound, seismic, or surface-water). Part 1 examined linear motion, and Part 2 examined angular motion. This course is an invitation to develop your problem-solving skills and to learn how to apply mathematics to all sorts of problems of the physical world. Learning the rules that govern how stuff moves in the world around us is exciting; using those rules to predict correctly something that you haven’t observed means that you really understand something. It‘s a great feeling.
WHAT SHOULD I KNOW BEFORE WE START?
You need not have taken physics before, but we assume that you have studied mathematics, up to and including a first course in calculus. You may be taking a calculus course concurrently with this course; that should be a good strategy. We will introduce important calculus ideas and methods as the need arises and provide examples.
There is a Mathematics Diagnostic Test that you can take at the beginning of Part 1 of this series to ensure that your mathematics background will set you up for success in this course.The basic physics of how objects move

When you meet a new person, it is hard to know what to expect.  You may not be able to read the person or understand what they mean. Even if you want to have a good relationship with them, this lack of understanding can make interactions tense, unpredictable and scary! The same is true for a lot of people as they encounter statistics and mathematical ways of working with data.  Statistics can be confusing and opaque.  Symbols, Greek letters, very large and very small numbers, and how to interpret all of this can leave to feeling cold and disengaged—even fearful and resentful.
But in the modern information age, having a healthy relationship with statistics can make life a whole lot easier. We are constantly faced with an onslaught of data and claims about it—from news articles, to Facebook and blog posts, casual and professional conversations, reports at our workplace, advertising, and claims from politicians and public officials. How can we process that information, make sense of it, evaluate truth claims, and put ourselves in a position to act on the information?  One of the most important ways is by befriending statistics and consistently using statistical ways of thinking.
 
The purpose of this course, then is to help you develop a functional, satisfying, and useful life-long relationship with statistics. To achieve that goal, we will take a non-technical approach—you will learn how statistics work and why they are so helpful in evaluating the world of information that is around us. You will learn about the logic of statistical thinking and the concepts (rather than the mathematical details and probability theory) that guide statistical inferences and conclusions.
 
You do not need to be a math whiz to take this course. If you can add, subtract, multiply, and divide (or just be able to use a calculator to do that!), you will be more than able to handle what will happen as this relationship develops.

By the end of the course you will be able to:
  Identify the most important features of a data set
Select a statistical test based on the features of the data
Think like a statistical detective
Understand the relationship between two different characteristics or variables
Perform some simple statistical calculations and draw some conclusions from real data
Hopefully, love stats! 
We’ll do all of this using entertaining examples related to real-life situations we all encounter in everyday life.Select appropriate statistical tests for data according to the levels of measurement
Perform basic calculations to determine statistical significance
Use standard methods of representation to summarize data
Interpret and assess the credibility of basic statistics

You face a difficult moral decision every time you decide what to eat. What impact should animal rights have on your decision? Is the suffering involved in meat, egg and dairy production bad enough that you should go vegan? How do your food choices affect the economy and the environment? Should you become a locavore? Should you eat only sustainably produced, "farm to table" food? Or is factory-farmed food more efficient and ultimately better for the environment?
We also face difficult food-related questions at the political-social level. Should states restrict their citizens' food choices so as to encourage healthy eating? Should governments grant patents on genetically modified crops? And how do we, as a society, implement effective food policies for a rapidly expanding world population?
This class will provide the tools required to reflect clearly and effectively on these challenging questions.
Our goal is to provide a working understanding of some leading ethical theories as well as the central empirical issues related to food production, distribution and consumption. Along the way, students will hear from a variety of scientists, philosophers, activists, and industry participants:
Carol Adams, author of The Sexual Politics of Meat
T. Colin Campbell, Cornell nutritionist and author of The China Study
Mark Bittman, cookbook author and New York Times food writer
Marion Nestle, nutritionist and author of Food Politics
Joe Regenstein, Cornell food scientist and director of the Kosher-Halal Food Initiative
Joel Salatin, alternative farming advocate and author of 9 books
Bryant Terry, award-winning chef, author of Vegan Soul Kitchen
Brian Wansink, Cornell food and brand psychologist, author of Mindless Eating
 Describe the central features of the Industrial Food System ("IFS")
Understand four major frameworks in the western tradition of philosophical ethics
Engage in ethical reflection about how food is produced, distributed, marketed, and consumed in the IFS and alternative systems.

This 5-week introductory course is for those who would like to explore and be fascinated by vernacular architecture – the subject and study of everyday buildings, landscapes and sites which are not designed by professional architects but “ordinary” practitioners. It explores vernacular architecture as an expression of local identity, indigenous traditions, and assimilation of different cultures.
This course covers topics such as native building materials, the interaction between people, culture and the vernacular, as well as the vernacular landscape. It has a special emphasis on the built heritage of Asia, which allows students to take a closer look at examples in diverse locales, such as the leather yurts in Mongolia, timber houses in Japan, brick, mud and straw houses in India, reinforced concrete fortified towers and grey brick courtyard houses in Southern China including Macau and Hong Kong.
Designed to promote discussion and dialogue while contributing to the discourse surrounding the concept of the vernacular, this course challenges the perception of tradition and stimulates a deeper analysis of one’s local environment. Indeed, we are keen to hear about how you link your new understanding to vernacular architecture in your neighborhood.
Those who wish to extend their experience and exploration please also join our subsequent 5-week course The Search for Vernacular Architecture of Asia, Part 2 in Summer 2015.Build a personal perspective on what constitutes vernacular architecture
Develop an appreciation of the values and meanings of vernacular architecture in your local environments
Demonstrate an awareness of how to protect and preserve your own vernacular built environment</description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>1028</course_id><title>Introducción a la Ingeniería del Helicóptero</title><published_date>2015-01-26T10:34:37-05:00</published_date><course_length>3 weeks</course_length><effort>6 hours per week</effort><subject>Engineering</subject><price>FREE

This course is designed to help you become a more effective and confident public speaker. We will demystify the process of writing, practicing, and performing a clear and engaging speech, work through the unique traits of oral versus written communication, and learn how to prepare speeches that are easier to deliver orally and understand aurally.
One of the best ways to refine your own speech ability is through a close study of others' speeches. We will have a number of opportunities to examine and discuss sample speeches and speakers. Growing out of our analysis of speakers, we will discuss who you hold up as a model speaker and analyze what makes that speaker effective. We will critically examine our own speeches and the speeches of others. By becoming a student of public speaking, you join a long history of rhetorical study dating back to ancient Greece.
This course is adapted from a similar class offered by the Bachelor of Arts in Integrated Social Sciences, a fully online degree completion program from the University of Washington.Design and deliver basic arguments clearly

Our world is in a data deluge with ever increasing sizes of datasets. Linear algebra is a tool to manage and analyze such data.
This course is part 2 of a 2-part course, with this part extending smoothly from the first. Note, however, that part 1, is not a prerequisite for part 2. In this part of the course, we'll develop the linear algebra more fully than part 1. This class has a focus on data mining with some applications of computer graphics. We'll discuss, in further depth than part 1, sports ranking and ways to rate teams from thousands of games. We’ll apply the methods to March Madness. We'll also learn methods behind web search, utilized by such companies as Google.  We'll also learn to cluster data to find similar groups and also how to compress images to lower the amount of storage used to store them. The tools that we learn can be applied to applications of your interest.  For instance, clustering data to find similar movies can be applied to find similar songs or friends. So, come to this course ready to investigate your own ideas.How to solve least-square systems, about eigenvectors of matrix, how to Markov Chains, and the matrix decomposition called the singular value decomposition.

Many seemingly great ideas and technologies come to a sudden halt in the face of one simple, inescapable question:
"Who is your customer?"
MIT has been asking its student entrepreneurs this question for many years – and with great success. The 25,600 companies started by MIT alumni generate $2 trillion in revenue and have created 3.3 million jobs. If MIT were a country, it would be the 11th largest economy in the world.
Become a citizen of this 11th largest economy! Join MIT in your entrepreneurial journey as you discover your startups most essential resource – the customer.
This is entrepreneurship – so don't expect a lecture. Every class session will be an in-depth and focused case study of MIT entrepreneurs from areas as diverse as mobile applications, 3D printing, power electronics, international development, and watchmaking.
You will learn, through the stories of MIT entrepreneurs, how to go from idea or technology to the necessary understanding of who and why will want to buy your product. Course assignments will be real-life exercises that will guide you through a series of concrete, practical, and effective steps that will help you make your idea very real.

Many early childhood educators report feeling ill equipped to meet the needs of children with challenging behavior and frustrated in their attempts to develop safe and nurturing early learning environment. If you work with young children, you are not alone in your feelings! Increasing evidence suggests that an effective approach to addressing problem behavior is the adoption of a model that focuses on promoting social-emotional development, providing support for children’s appropriate behavior, and preventing challenging behavior. In this class, you will learn a framework for addressing the social and emotional development and challenging behavior of young children.
The overarching goal of this course is to learn evidence-based practices to support the social and emotional development of infants and young children. We will read current research on the developmental trajectory of children with early-onset aggressive behaviors; positive behavior support program models; and intervention efforts that promote positive early childhood mental health. Evidence-based classroom management skills will also be studied and you will leave the course with a solid understanding of how to design supportive environments. This course incorporates a community with which you can learn from others, share your own current approaches and discuss your attempts to incorporate the learnings of this course into your early childhood practice.Prevent and address challenging behavior and to foster social emotional competence in young children

The modern smartphone is enabled by a billion-plus nanotransistors, each having an active region that is barely a few hundred atoms long. Interestingly the same amazing technology has also led to a deeper understanding of the nature of current flow on an atomic scale and my aim is to make these lessons from nanoelectronics accessible to anyone in any branch of science or engineering. I will assume very little background beyond linear algebra and differential equations, although we will be discussing advanced concepts in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics that should be of interest even to specialists.
 
In the first half of this course (4 weeks) we will introduce a new perspective connecting the quantized conductance of short ballistic conductors to the familiar Ohm's law of long diffusive conductors, along with a brief description of the modern nanotransistor. In the second half (4 weeks) we will address fundamental conceptual issues related to the meaning of resistance on an atomic scale, the interconversion of electricity and heat, the second law of thermodynamics and the fuel value of information.
 
Overall I hope to show that the lessons of nanoelectronics lead naturally to a new viewpoint, one that changes even some basic concepts we all learn in freshman physics. This unique viewpoint not only clarifies many old questions but also provides a powerful approach to new questions at the frontier of modern nanoelectronics, such as how devices can be built to control the spin of electrons.
 
This course was originally offered in 2012 on nanoHUB-U and the accompanying text was subsequently published by World Scientific. I am preparing a second edition for publication in 2015, which will be used for this course. The manuscript will be made available to registered students.

What is religion? What is Hip Hop? Are they the same thing? Do they overlap? Over six weeks we’ll get a sense of how some individuals answer these questions, and you’ll get the tools you need to explore these questions for yourselves.
We will start our time together with some basic assumptions, the most important being a willingness to think about Hip Hop and religion as cultures that wrestle with the huge questions of our existence: Who are we? Why are we? Where are we?  on hip You will also need to be open to the possibility of Hip Hop as a language through which these complex and religious questions are presented, explored, and interpreted.
As this course unfolds, we’ll look closely into the relationship between Hip Hop culture and religion. We will explore the ways in which Hip Hop culture discusses and provides life meaning in complex ways through  (1) a discussion of the history and content of rap music; (2) an examination of religion in rap music; (3) an exploration of the religious sensibilities of rap artists; and (4) a discussion of the implications of the connection between rap and religion.
We will accomplish this through a unique mix of videos, readings, music, images, stories and behind-the scenes insider perspectives. 
All required readings are available within the courseware and complete texts are also available for purchase.
Join this course to enhance your understanding of the intersections between religion and Hip Hop culture in the United States. No prior knowledge is required. All lectures will be in English.

Perhaps no story is as essential to get right as the history of capitalism. Nearly all of our theories about promoting progress come from how we interpret the economic changes of the last 500 years. This past decade’s crises continue to remind us just how much capitalism changes, even as its basic features—wage labor, financial markets, private property, entrepreneurs—endure. While capitalism has a global history, the United States plays a special role in that story. This course will help you to understand how the United States became the world’s leading economic power, revealing essential lessons about what has been and what will be possible in capitalism’s on-going revolution.
FAQ
Do I need to have taken economics before?
No. Though there will be discussion of economic ideas, professors will assume no prior economic training.
I am not familiar with American history, but I am interested in how capitalism works. Can I take this course?
Yes. We will have relevant links to helpful background material for each section that should make it possible for those with no knowledge of U.S. history to take the class.
Is this class about economic thought like Smith, Marx, Ricardo, Hayek, etc.?
This class is primarily about what actually happened rather than theories of what happened. While we will touch on important economic thinkers, this class will focus more on the people and institutions that developed capitalism in the United States. If you want to know how capitalism works and came about, this is the class for you.
Will certificates be awarded?
Yes. If you complete the work and achieve a passing grade in the course, you can earn a Honor Code Certificate, which indicates that you have completed the course successfully. Certificates will be issued by edX under the name of CornellX, designating the institution from which the course originated.
What will help me complete this course?
We have found that the best help you can get is other people in the real world. Enlist friends, co-workers, family, and other people to take the class with you. Ask your friends on Facebook or Twitter. Arrange a time during a lunch break or an evening to discuss the week’s videos and readings. Think of this “MOOC club” like a book club! You will get more out of the material and be much more likely to finish.

Technological innovations have revolutionized the way we view and interact with the world around us. Editing a photo, re-mixing a song, automatically measuring and adjusting chemical concentrations in a tank: each of these tasks requires real-world data to be captured by a computer and then manipulated digitally to extract the salient information. Ever wonder how signals from the physical world are sampled, stored, and processed without losing the information required to make predictions and extract meaning from the data?
Students will find out in this rigorous mathematical introduction to the engineering field of signal processing: the study of signals and systems that extract information from the world around us. This course will teach students to analyze discrete-time signals and systems in both the time and frequency domains. Students will learn convolution, discrete Fourier transforms, the z-transform, and digital filtering. Students will apply these concepts in interactive MATLAB programming exercises (all done in browser, no download required).
Part 1 of this course analyzes signals and systems in the time domain. Part 2 covers frequency domain analysis.
Prerequisites include strong problem solving skills, the ability to understand mathematical representations of physical systems, and advanced mathematical background (one-dimensional integration, matrices, vectors, basic linear algebra, imaginary numbers, and sum and series notation). Part 1 is a prerequisite for Part 2. This course is an excerpt from an advanced undergraduate class at Rice University taught to all electrical and computer engineering majors.The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)

This course, the fourth installment of the multi-part Poetry in America series, explores the poetry of Emily Dickinson, one of America’s most distinctive and prolific poets. While Dickinson wrote nearly 2,000 poems during her lifetime, she chose never to publish, opting instead to revisit and revise her works throughout her lifetime.  Keeping this dynamic of self-revision in mind, we will consider a number of Dickinson’s poems—many seemingly in tension with one another—concerned with Nature, Art, the Self, and Darkness. We will travel to the Dickinson Collection at Harvard's Houghton Library, and to Amherst, Massachusetts, paying a visit to the house in which the poet lived and wrote until her death in 1886. Distinguished guests for this module include NBA athlete Jason Collins, dancers Damian Woetzel and Charles “Lil Buck” Riley, and President and CEO of the New America Foundation Anne Marie Slaughter, among others.
 
Led by Harvard Professor Elisa New, Poetry in America surveys nearly 400 years of American poetry. Through video lectures, archival images and texts, expeditions to historic sites, interpretive seminars with large and small groups, interviews with poets and scholars, and conversations about poems with distinguished Americans, Poetry in America embarks on a journey through the literature of a nation. Distinguished guests, including President Bill Clinton, Elena Kagan, Henry Louis Gates, Eve Ensler, John McCain, Andrea Mitchell, Michael Pollan, Drew Faust, Tony Kushner, and Nas, among others, bring fresh perspectives to the study of American Poetry.

WHAT IS “HOW STUFF MOVES”?
Mechanics is the study of how things move. It was the first quantitative science to achieve wide power to predict behavior, including things never before directly observed. Newton, Leibniz, and others invented calculus to describe motion and we will find both differential and integral calculus extremely useful throughout this course.
This is the second in a 3-part series of courses that parallels the second-semester mechanics course taught at Harvey Mudd College. Part 2 expands on Part 1 by considering the rotation of objects, connecting new concepts of angular momentum and torque to the properties of linear motion. Part 1 examined linear motion, and Part 3 examines wave motion. This course is an invitation to develop your problem-solving skills and to learn how to apply mathematics to all sorts of problems of the physical world. Learning the rules that govern how stuff moves in the world around us is exciting; using those rules to predict correctly something that you haven’t observed means that you really understand something. It‘s a great feeling.
WHAT SHOULD I KNOW BEFORE WE START?
You need not have taken physics before, but we assume that you have studied mathematics, up to and including a first course in calculus. You may be taking a calculus course concurrently with this course; that should be a good strategy. We will introduce important calculus ideas and methods as the need arises and provide examples.
There is a Mathematics Diagnostic Test that you can take at the beginning of Part 1 of this series to ensure that your mathematics background will set you up for success in this course.The basic physics of how objects move

FAQ
What are the prerequisites?
We will assume that you are familiar with vectors, that you know how to calculate integrals, and that you have had introductory mechanics. These topics will be briefly reviewed as needed, but not in a systematic way. If you have not had classes in these topics it may be possible to complete the course with extra study.
What textbook is required?
The course will not strictly follow or make assignments from a specific textbook.  Any recent freshman physics textbook will suffice. Reading assignments will be given by topic, including links to several free online physics textbooks. </description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>1044</course_id><title>Incarceration's Witnesses: American Prison Writing</title><published_date>2014-10-27T09:52:10-04:00</published_date><course_length>6 weeks</course_length><effort>3 to 4 hours per week</effort><subject>Humanities</subject><price>FREE</price><level>Introductory</level><school>HamiltonX</school><language>English</language><url>https://www.edx.org/course/incarcerations-witnesses-american-prison-hamiltonx-eng142x</url><status>Future Dates To Be Announced</status><instructors><instructor><name>Doran Larson</name><bio>null</bio><img>https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/person/image/doran_larson_110x110.jpg</img></instructor></instructors><description>This is an Archived Course

The U.S. incarcerates a larger number and percentage of its own citizens than any nation on earth: larger than China, Russia, Cuba, or Iran. American ex-offenders are arrested again at a rate of 67% within three years, and 75% within five years of release. This course looks inside U.S. prisons, through the history of literary witness produced by incarcerated people. This history will help us to understand the mass-scale prison’s rise, its day-to-day practices, and why it fails so badly at the task of rehabilitation. Through prison witness, we may hope to begin to understand what is needed to make the U.S. prison a more socially constructive institution. Among other texts, we will read and discuss Fourth City: Essays from the Prison in America, The (online) American Prison Writing Archive, hosted and made possible by Hamilton College's Digital Humanities Initiative, and come to a sense of the moral weight that prison witness must carry in any truly democratic debate on the criminal justice system.How first-person testimonial by incarcerated people can help us understand the American prison system

这门课是从头开始学C++吗?
不是。本课程假定你已经学过C语言，只讲授C++中面向对象和泛型的部分。
C语言不够用吗?为什么还要学C++?
因为C++比C语言更加适合用来编写需要多人协作的大型程序。
学习面向对象编程，我为什么不去学Java，要学C++呢？
C++程序运行效率比Java高，因此需要讲究速度的大型程序，比如3D游戏，C++比Java更适合。另外，C++可以编写任何程序，比如设备驱动程序，而Java很难用于编写贴近硬件底层的程序。此外，学习C++，相比于学习Java，对计算机的工作原理会理解得更加深刻一些。另外，许多IT大公司面试时，常会问关于C++的问题。
我是学生，似乎没什么机会些大程序，那如何能体会C++的优势呢？

东南亚在中国之南，且濒临海洋，所以古代把它称为“南海”或“南洋”。“东南亚”这个名称，是第二次世界大战期间才出现的。东南亚地区很早就有人类 活动，并在公元前后形成了原始的文化形态，主要表现在东南亚的岩画、巨石、瓮葬和铜鼓等特色鲜明文化遗迹。从公元3世纪开始，印度文化、中国文化、伊斯兰 文化和西方文化陆续进入东南亚地区，经历了长期的本土化过程，与东南亚的本土文化进行了充分的融合，形成了独特的文化形态和文化特点。

1967 年，印度尼西亚、泰国、新加坡、菲律宾四国外长和马来西亚副总理在曼谷举行会议，发表了《曼谷宣言》（《东南亚国家联盟成立宣言》），正式宣告东南亚国家 联盟（简称“东盟”）成立。20世纪80年代后，文莱（1984年）、越南（1995年）、老挝（1997年）、缅甸（1997年）和柬埔寨（1999 年）5国先后加入东盟，使这一组织涵盖整个东南亚地区。

由于中国与东南亚在地理位置上的相邻关系，奠定了东南亚地区在中国对外关系中的 “首要”地位。随着中国与东南亚交流层次的逐步深入，中国扩大了国际影响力，积累了丰富的开展国际交流的经验。但是，由于中国民众对于东南亚文化的了解程 度还有提升的空间，从而也在中国与东南亚的交流中造成了一定的问题。本课程将将系统梳理东南亚文化发展进程的基础上，以兼顾东南亚传统文化与现代文化的特 点，以具体的文化现象为中心，为同学们呈现东南亚文化的多样性与独特性。
 
"Southeast Asia" is the term which appeared during World War II. In Chinese history documents, this region was called “Nan Yang” or “Nan Hai”. From the beginning of the 3rd century AD, Indian culture, Chinese culture, Islamic culture and Western culture have moved into this area. After a long process of localization, external culture and the native culture were fully fused, forming a unique cultural expression and cultural characteristics.

In 1967, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines and Malaysia issued "Bangkok Declaration" to declare the establishment of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was established. After the 1980s, Brunei (1984), Vietnam (1995), Laos (1997), Myanmar (1997) and Cambodia (1999) has joined the ASEAN, so that this organization covering the entire Southeast Asian region.

As the geographical neighbor of China, the Southeast Asian region plays "top" role in China's foreign relations. With the gradual deepening of exchanges between China and Southeast Asia, misunderstanding of cultures caused some problems. In order to improve the understanding of Chinese people about the neighbor countries, this course will show the development steps of Southeast Asian culture, and explain the traditional and modern culture features of Southeast Asia through the specific cultural phenomenons.

Playing drums, telling stories, touching stones, creating wildly colorful altars, dancing, eating and drinking special substances are all basic religious activities. Examples will range across Native American, Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim, Christian, and Jewish rituals and symbols, and materials will traverse fields from art history to anthropology, philosophy to poetry, science to religious studies. We will toggle between broad theories of religions and specific case studies.

An introductory week will be followed by a week on each of the five senses, and a concluding week. Each week we will incorporate lectures, readings, podcasts, images, and videos, and students will be challenged to spend a little time "offline" and taking notice of the sensual-spiritual elements that make up our cultural life.Find ways to critically reflect on religious environments

From simulating complex phenomenon on supercomputers to storing the coordinates needed in modern 3D printing, data is a huge and growing part of our world. A major tool to manipulate and study this data is linear algebra. This course is part 1 of a 2-part course.  In this part, we’ll learn basics of matrix algebra with an emphasis on application.  This class has a focus on computer graphics while also containing examples in data mining. We’ll learn to make an image transparent, fade from one image to another, and rotate a 3D wireframe model.  We’ll also mine data; for example, we will find similar movies that one might enjoy seeing. In the topic of sports ranking, we’ll be ready to participate in March Madness and submit our own mathematically generated brackets to compete against millions of others.  The lectures are developed to encourage you to explore and create your own ideas either through your own programming but also with online tools developed for the course.  Come to this course ready to investigate your own ideas.Fundamental mathematical operations on matrices such as matrix arithmetic, norms, and solving linear systems
Applications of linear algebra in data mining such as finding similar elements in a dataset using measure of distance, a method to recognize handwritten numbers using matrix norms, and ranking sports teams
Applications of linear algebra in computer graphics such as visually approximating an image with a page of typed characters, blending images, and creating composite images.

How can Iran be stopped from getting a nuclear bomb—negotiations, sanctions, or military action? As a participant in this course, you will advise the president in deciding whether, and how, the U.S. should act. Once you’ve made your assessment, you will move on to wrestle with other scenarios preoccupying policy makers. Between the Assad regime and ISIS, civilians in Syria and Iraq face unimaginable atrocities. Should the U.S. intervene? China’s rise is rattling capitalist economies and a half-century of Pacific peace. What counterbalancing actions should Washington take? Leaks are a fact of life — but why do they happen? Who gets them, and why? Should journalists publish or withhold them? Does legal accountability lie with the leaker—or the journalist?

This six-week course casts you as advisors on the hardest decisions any president has to make. We will go behind the veil to see the dynamic between the press and the U.S. government, to explore these dilemmas. We will also have to contend with the reality that government secrets rarely stay that way. Participants will learn to navigate the political landscape of an era in which private remarks become viral tweets, and mistakes by intelligence agencies become front-page stories.

Weekly assignments require strategic thinking: Analyzing dynamics of challenges and developing strategies for addressing them.  Students will learn to summarize their analyses in a succinct “Strategic Options Memo,” combining careful analysis and strategic imagination with the necessity to communicate to major constituencies in order to sustain public support. They will also examine how policymaking is affected by constant, public analysis of government deliberations.

Urban school reform in the United States is characterized by contentious, politicized debate. This course explores a set of critical issues in the education and educational reform space, with a focus on aspects of the field that have sparked controversy and polarized views. We will dig into these debates, situating them within the larger history of public education and school reform, and considering the viewpoints, the evidence, and translation of issues into educational policy.
 
The class is designed with multiple student perspectives in mind with appropriate content and access points for policymakers, school leaders, teachers and parents or other concerned citizens. No background knowledge is required.
 
We will consider three themes in this course:
Federal Strategies in School Reform: How has the federal government legislated and incented public school reform? What are the implications of those approaches given the nature of local control in American public education? We will discuss three particular strategies the federal government has enacted recently and the diverging perspectives on them.
School Choice: How does school choice aim to improve schools? What forms does it take? Does providing school choice improve schools?
Accountability: What is the history of accountability in American public schooling? What are the policies and practices associated with accountability and what are the assumptions behind them? Does accountability lead to improved outcomes for students?You will develop an informed historical perspective about public schooling in the United States
You will better understand how the unique contextual elements of the American approach to public schooling has led to divergent views on how best to organize and improve schools
You will be able to analyze the divergent viewpoints about American public school history and school reform policy, the evidence around them, and their influence on policy and practice in the field of education</description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>1051</course_id><title>Organic Electronic Devices</title><published_date>2014-10-27T11:25:26-04:00</published_date><course_length>7 weeks</course_length><effort>6 hours per week</effort><subject>Electronics</subject><price>FREE

Technological innovations have revolutionized the way we view and interact with the world around us. Editing a photo, re-mixing a song, automatically measuring and adjusting chemical concentrations in a tank: each of these tasks requires real-world data to be captured by a computer and then manipulated digitally to extract the salient information. Ever wonder how signals from the physical world are sampled, stored, and processed without losing the information required to make predictions and extract meaning from the data?
Students will find out in this rigorous mathematical introduction to the engineering field of signal processing: the study of signals and systems that extract information from the world around us. This course will teach students to analyze discrete-time signals and systems in both the time and frequency domains. Students will learn convolution, discrete Fourier transforms, the z-transform, and digital filtering. Students will apply these concepts in interactive MATLAB programming exercises (all done in browser, no download required).
Part 1 of this course analyzes signals and systems in the time domain. Part 2 covers frequency domain analysis.
Prerequisites include strong problem solving skills, the ability to understand mathematical representations of physical systems, and advanced mathematical background (one-dimensional integration, matrices, vectors, basic linear algebra, imaginary numbers, and sum and series notation). Part 1 is a prerequisite for Part 2. This course is an excerpt from an advanced undergraduate class at Rice University taught to all electrical and computer engineering majors.Types of Fundamental Signals

Las estructuras están implicadas en nuestras vidas: las plantas, los animales, casi todo lo que fabrica el ser humano, incluso nuestro propio cuerpo, deben soportar una serie de fuerzas sin romperse, y por lo tanto prácticamente cualquier elemento de nuestro entorno es una estructura de una clase u otra. No cabe duda de que entender cómo se comportan las estructuras es fundamental para entender el mundo que nos rodea, para comprender la naturaleza y para juzgar mejor los progresos que ha hecho la humanidad a lo largo de la historia. Sin embargo, los ingenieros hemos fallado una y otra vez cuando hemos intentado explicar esta materia de forma que los no entendidos puedan entender su importancia.
Este curso pretende saltar esa brecha existente entre los expertos en cálculo de estructuras y los profanos utilizando un lenguaje asequible, empleando ejemplos históricos y proponiendo ensayos sencillos que pueden hacerse en casa. El curso abordará no sólo el problema de por qué los edificios y los puentes se caen sino también otras muchas cuestiones ¿Por qué las ventanas de los aviones son redondas? ¿Por qué los gusanos tienen esa forma? ¿Por qué los murciélagos pueden volar dentro de un rosal sin rasgarse las alas? ¿Cómo funcionan las arterias? ¿Por qué las catedrales góticas pueden ser tan esbeltas? ¿Por qué hay construcciones romanas que siguen en pie 2000 años después? ¿Qué podemos aprender sobre los constructores de las diferentes estructuras que nos han legado nuestros antepasados? Muchos contenidos de este curso pueden ser útiles para médicos, biólogos, artistas, historiadores y arqueólogos.

WHAT IS “HOW STUFF MOVES”?
Mechanics is the study of how things move. It was the first quantitative science to achieve wide power to predict behavior, including things never before directly observed. Newton, Leibniz, and others invented calculus to describe motion and we will find both differential and integral calculus extremely useful throughout this course.
This is the first in a 3-part series of courses that parallels the second-semester mechanics course taught at Harvey Mudd College. Part 1 explores the concepts of momentum, force, and energy, and how these properties define the motion of objects at everyday speeds. Part 2 examines angular motion, and Part 3 examines wave motion.  This course is an invitation to develop your problem-solving skills and to learn how to apply mathematics to all sorts of problems of the physical world. Learning the rules that govern how stuff moves in the world around us is exciting; using those rules to predict correctly something that you haven’t observed means that you really understand something. It‘s a great feeling.
WHAT SHOULD I KNOW BEFORE WE START?
You need not have taken physics before, but we assume that you have studied mathematics, up to and including a first course in calculus. You may be taking a calculus course concurrently with this course; that should be a good strategy. We will introduce important calculus ideas and methods as the need arises and provide examples.
There is a Mathematics Diagnostic Test that you can take at the beginning of this course to ensure that your mathematics background will set you up for success in this course.The basic physics of how objects move

How can we strengthen libraries and librarians in the advancement of knowledge, creativity, and literacy in the 21st century? Though libraries have been loved for over 3,600 years, their relevance in the digital age is being questioned, and their economic and social impacts are poorly understood. What is really essential about libraries and librarians, today and tomorrow? How can library members and all who support the mission of 21st-century librarianship raise the profile and support of these timeless values and services, and ensure universal access to the universe of ideas in all our communities? This course is based on what works. We’ll take an inspired, strategic, evidence-based approach to advocacy for the future of strong communities – cities, villages, universities and colleges, research and development centres, businesses, and not-for-profits.

We will cover:
Values and transformative impacts of libraries and librarianship
Research on current perceptions of libraries and librarians
Role of relationships in advocacy
Principles of influence and their impact on advocacy
Strategic thinking and planning in advocacy
Effective communication: messages, messengers, and timing
Guest speakers share their ideas, recommendations and successes. These leading advocates include, among others: 
Barbara Band, Emmbrook School, Berkshire
Cathy De Rosa, OCLC
Ken Haycock, University of Southern California
Joe Janes, University of Washington
Nancy Kranich, Rutgers University
Victoria Owen, University of Toronto
John Szabo, Los Angeles Public Library
Previous participants have said that this course – “showed me the value of building relationships,” and “made me approach our library’s advocacy much differently”, and “helped me see advocacy in a new light."

Advocacy is growing in urgency and importance on the agenda of all library associations.  In this highly competitive environment, associations help their members and their communities to build advocacy capacity.  This course meets that strategic need. It is offered in partnership with the Canadian Library Association and the American Library Association.

This interdisciplinary course explores the complex interactions between poverty, rural livelihoods, and forest resources in developing countries.  We will consider some of the dynamics that occur when impoverished people use forests in their daily lives. We will talk about the role of forests for medicines and wild foods, as sources of fuelwood and charcoal for energy, and other pressing topics that confront sustainable forest management such as the impacts of human health and diseases on forests. The course consists of modules on forests and livelihoods in developing countries, agroforestry, human health in forested environments, protected areas and their sustainability, small and medium forest enterprises (SMFEs), and  community forestry. Three cross-cutting themes (gender, tenure and forest rights, and climate change) will span all of the modules.

This course will engage you in developing a deeper understanding of the fundamental importance of forest resources in the lives and livelihoods of people in developing countries. Participants from tropical and developing countries may have lived much of what we will talk about in this course, and your experiences will deepen our understanding of the course material. Participants not from a developing country will gain a much better appreciation for the multitude of ways that people in developing countries use forest resources. Weekly videos will be complemented by readings, quizzes, and links to online resources to help you explore current scholarship in this domain. A discussion forum will enable you to delve more deeply into these issues with other participants and the course staff. The themes covered in this MOOC are important to anyone working in international forestry. </description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>1064</course_id><title>ISSCC Previews: Circuit and System Insights</title><published_date>2014-11-07T14:02:08-05:00</published_date><course_length>13 weeks</course_length><effort>30 minutes per week</effort><subject>Electronics</subject><price>FREE</price><level>Introductory</level><school>IEEEx</school><language>English</language><url>https://www.edx.org/course/isscc-previews-circuit-system-insights-ieeex-issccx</url><status>Future Dates To Be Announced</status><instructors><instructor><name>Anantha Chandrakasan</name><bio>null</bio><img>https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/person/image/anantha_chandrakasan_110x110.jpg</img></instructor><instructor><name>Elad Alon</name><bio>null</bio><img>https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/person/image/elad-alon_110x110.jpg</img></instructor><instructor><name>Shekhar Borkar</name><bio>null</bio><img>https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/person/image/shekhar-borkar_110x110.jpg</img></instructor><instructor><name>Leland Chang</name><bio>null</bio><img>https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/person/image/leland-chang_110x110.jpg</img></instructor><instructor><name>Payam Heydari</name><bio>null</bio><img>https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/person/image/payam-heydari_110x110.jpg</img></instructor><instructor><name>Mark Horowitz</name><bio>null</bio><img>https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/person/image/mark-horowitz_110x110.jpg</img></instructor><instructor><name>Nicky Lu</name><bio>null</bio><img>https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/person/image/nicky-lu_110x110.jpg</img></instructor><instructor><name>Alyosha Molnar</name><bio>null</bio><img>https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/person/image/al-molnar_110x110.jpg</img></instructor><instructor><name>Boris Murmann</name><bio>null</bio><img>https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/person/image/boris-murmann_110x110.jpg</img></instructor><instructor><name>Bram Nauta</name><bio>null</bio><img>https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/person/image/bram-nauta_110x110.jpg</img></instructor><instructor><name>Willy Sansen</name><bio>null</bio><img>https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/person/image/willy-sansen_110x110.jpg</img></instructor><instructor><name>Stefano Stanzione</name><bio>null</bio><img>https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/person/image/stefano-stanzione_110x110.jpg</img></instructor></instructors><description>This is an Archived Course

Vision may feel effortless: you open your eyes, and the world appears. But the process of focusing light into image on the back of the eye and translating it into meaningful nerve signals is incredibly complex. The retina and visual cortex are packed with intricate processing circuitry, and have been a mystery to neuroscientists for centuries. Now, answers are beginning to emerge.
 
Today, the visual system is often called the model system for neuroscience: its findings are relevant to all other areas and to investigating the deeper mysteries of the brain’s microstructure and function. In this course, we take you from the physics of focusing light onto the retina, to the processing of colors, form, and motion, and finally to the interpretation of visual information in the cortex. We distill the mysteries of the visual system by posing questions and investigating them in a series of thematic, animated videos. This journey through the eye, retina and brain will (quite literally) change how you see the world. </description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>1066</course_id><title>数据结构与算法第二部分 | Data Structures and Algorithms Part 2</title><published_date>2014-09-24T12:20:54-04:00</published_date><course_length>8 weeks</course_length><effort>4 - 8 hours/week | 小时／周</effort><subject>Computer Science</subject><price>FREE</price><level>Advanced</level><school>PekingX</school><language>English, 中文</language><url>https://www.edx.org/course/shu-ju-jie-gou-yu-suan-fa-di-er-bu-fen-pekingx-04830050-2x</url><status>Future Dates To Be Announced</status><instructors><instructor><name>张铭 Ming Zhang</name><bio>null</bio><img>https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/person/image/ming-zhang-110x110.jpg</img></instructor></instructors><description>This is an Archived Course

计算机是现代社会中用于解决问题的重要工具。利用计算机解决实际问题需要将问题抽象，并对数据进行操作，最后通过计算机程序求解问题。而本门课程主要内容就是对以上内容进行研究。
图灵奖获得者N.Wirth写了一本经典著作“程序=算法+数据结构”。数据结构，是抽象的表示数据的方式；算法，则是计算的一系列有效、通用的步骤。算法与数据结构是程序设计中相辅相成的两个方面。
我 们会围绕着“算法+数据结构=程序”的思路，以问题求解为导向进行学习。希望能够帮助大家提高理论、抽象、设计的能力。在扎实的经典理论基础上，运用问题 抽象、数据抽象、算法抽象来分析问题，应用适当的数据结构和算法来设计和实现相应的程序。通过课程学习，大家的抽象思维能力、问题求解能力将得到较大提 升，编程能力和代码质量会有质的飞跃！
在求解实际问题方面，我们会学习到通过权衡时空和其他资源开销，利用数据结构来组织数据、设计高效的算法、完成高质量的程序以满足错综复杂的实际应用需要。
此外，课程所学到的内容会被利用到计算机科学后续的各个课程中，如操作系统、软件工程、数据库概论、编译技术、计算机图形学、人机交互等。希望可以为大家将来从事计算机相关的学习、研究和开发工作打下扎实的基础。
本课程采用张铭主编的国家“十一五”规划教材《数据结构与算法》（高等教育出版社）。适合计算机以及相关理工专业的大二本科生学习，需要先修过计算概论等课程，具有结构化和面向对象的程序设计基础。
在 第一部分学完了线性表、栈与队列、字符串、二叉树、树和图这些基础数据结构之后，第二部分我们将深入学习排序、检索、索引、高级数据结构以及数据结构应用 等内容。涉及快速排序、外排序等各种经典排序算法，集合、散列、位图等检索方法，B/B+树、Trie树等索引结构，广义表、多维数组等高级线性结 构，AVL、红黑树、伸展树等平衡二叉树。第二部分课程持续8周，学习者每周在本课程上需要投入4－8小时。本课程的本次开设得到Google研究经费支 持。
Computers are an important tool for problem solving and are deeply involved in modern life. Computers perform operations on data. What is the logical relationship among data? How is data stored in computers? What algorithms are required to solve particular problems? These are the questions that will be answered in “Data Structures and Algorithms,” an important core course in Computer Science. The course also introduces students to fundamental data structures and classical algorithms used in more specialized courses, including Operating Systems, Software Engineering, Database Systems, Compiler Principles, Computer Graphics and Human Computer Interaction.
Niklaus Wirth described the important and indivisible link between algorithms and data structure in his book, Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs.
The course will build on Wirth’s ideas as it helps students improve their knowledge of theory and their ability to think abstractly to solve problems. Building on a solid theoretical foundation, students will analyze problems using data and algorithm abstraction. Students will learn how to organize data efficiently and make tradeoffs between space and time complexity, design efficient and effective algorithms, and implement high quality programs to solve complex real-world problems. After studying this course, students will be well prepared for further study and research in engineering and other computer-related areas.
This is an intermediate-level course appropriate for sophomore students majoring in computer science or other science/engineering disciplines. Students should have learned "introduction to computing", with the knowledge of structured and object-oriented programming.
This course is presented in two eight-week sessions. In session 1, we learnt Linear Lists, Stacks, Queues, Strings, Binary Trees, Trees and Graphs, which are fundamental data structures. In the second session, we will study advanced data structures and algorithms, such as Sorting, Searching, Indexing, as well as their applications thoroughly. More detailed, these chapters include a variety of classic Sorting algorithms (Quicksort, External Sorting), Searching methods (Sets, Hash Tables, Bitmaps), Indexing structures (B/B+ trees, Trie trees), Advanced List-Structure (generalized lists, Multi-dimensional arrays) and Balanced Binary Trees (AVL, Red-Black trees, Splay trees). The second part of the course lasts eight weeks. Each week, student will spend 4-8 hours to follow this course.
Students who score 60% or higher will receive an Honor Code Certificate.
The Autumn 2014 Sessions of this course are supported by Google.
课程采用的算法语言? Which programming languages does the course use?
本课程采用基于C++的伪代码授课和出习题。编程作业是POJ自动评判的，该平台目前接受 C、C++、Java等都可以。
The course’s content and exercises are both based upon C++ pseudo code. Programming assignments are automatically assessed by POJ which accepts code written in C/C++ and JAVA.帮助学生学习如何运用数据结构和算法解决复杂的实际问题

Entrepreneurship and Healthcare in Emerging Economies aims to engage students in an inter-disciplinary approach to understanding the nature of complex health problems throughout the world, with an illustrative focus on South Asia. Students will become acquainted with prior attempts to address these problems, to identify points of opportunity for smart entrepreneurial efforts, and to propose and develop their own candidate solutions.
Throughout, the emphasis is on individual agency—what can the learner do to address a defined problem? While we use the lens of health to explore entrepreneurial opportunities, students will see that both problems and solutions are inevitably of a multi-disciplinary nature, and we will draw on a range of sectors and fields of study.

Capturing and analyzing data has changed how decisions are made and resources are allocated in businesses, journalism, government, and military and intelligence fields. Through better use of data, leaders are able to plan and enact strategies with greater clarity and confidence. Data drives increased organizational efficiency and a competitive advantage. Simply, analytics provide new insight and actionable intelligence.
In education, the use of data and analytics to improve learning is referred to as learning analytics. Analytics have not yet made the impact on education that they have made in other fields. That’s starting to change. Software companies, researchers, educators, and university leaders recognize the value of data in improving not only teaching and learning, but the entire education sector. In particular, learning analytics enables universities, schools, and corporate training departments to improve the quality of learning and overall competitiveness. Research communities such as the International Educational Data Mining Society (IEDMS) and the Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR) are developing promising models for improving learner success through predictive analytics, machine learning, recommender systems (content and social), network analysis, tracking the development of concepts through social systems, discourse analysis, and intervention and support strategies. The era of data and analytics in learning is just beginning.
Data, Analytics, and Learning provides an introduction to learning analytics and how it is being deployed in various contexts in education, including to support automated intervention, to inform instructors, and to promote scientific discovery. Additionally, we will discuss tools and methods, what skills data scientists need in education, and how to protect student privacy and other rights. The course will provide a broad overview of the field, suitable for a broad audience. Learners will explore the logic of analytics, the basics of finding, cleaning, and using educational data, predictive models, text analysis, and activity graphs and social networks. We will discuss use of analytics in data domains such as log files and text data.  Tableau Software is partnering with University of Texas Arlington to provide analytics software to course participants as well as technical support and guest lectures. Additional software will be introduced and discussed throughout the course.
How this course works:
This course will experiment with multiple learning pathways. It has been structured to allow learners to take various pathways through learning content - either in the existing edX format or in a social competency-based and self-directed format. Learners will have access to pathways that support both beginners, and more advanced students, with pointers to additional advanced resources. In addition to interactions within the edX platform, learners will be encouraged to engage in distributed conversations on social media such as blogs and Twitter.How to identify trade offs between proprietary and open source tools commonly used in learning analytics

This class engages students in a transdisciplinary conversation about representations of HIV/AIDS: in science writing, journalism, visual art, literature, drama, and popular culture. We believe that scientists and cultural critics can learn valuable lessons from one another, even as they create their own responses to HIV/AIDS. Today, over 30 years since the first scientific reports of HIV/AIDS, the pandemic remains a major health concern throughout the world. But, rays of hope have led to speculation that an AIDS-free generation may be possible. In such a timely moment, it is essential for us to connect across the "two cultures" as we consider the social and scientific implications of HIV/AIDS.The basics of how to do literary analysis and how to read a scientific article

Shakespeare wrote for a popular audience and was immensely successful. Shakespeare is also rightly regarded as one of the greatest playwrights the world has known. This course will try to understand both Shakespeare’s popularity and his greatness by starting from a simple premise: that the fullest appreciation of Shakespeare can be achieved only when literary study is combined with analysis of the plays as theatre. Hence, as we delve into the dimensions that make Shakespeare’s plays so extraordinary--from the astonishing power of their language to their uncanny capacity to illuminate so much of human life--we will also explore them in performance from Shakespeare’s own theatre to the modern screen. At the same time, actors will occasionally join our effort and demonstrate ways of bringing the text alive as living theatre. Plays to be studied will include Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Much Ado About Nothing, Othello, King Lear, and The Winter's Tale.

Musculoskeletal AnatomyX invites students to join basic science and clinical faculty at Harvard Medical School (HMS) to learn about several musculoskeletal injuries commonly seen in clinical practice.
For each case, students visit the HMS Clinical Skills Center to observe the initial patient encounter and physical examination by an orthopedic surgeon. Following the patient encounter, students complete the interactive gross anatomy, histology and radiology learning sessions essential for understanding the case. The anatomy learning sessions include observing actual dissections in the Harvard Medical School anatomy laboratories revealing and explaining the human anatomy relevant for each clinical case.
After completing the case learning sessions, students review pertinent radiology images, commit to a tentative diagnosis from a list of differential diagnoses, and accompany the patient to a virtual operating room to observe the surgical treatment.  In the virtual operating room, students observe narrated videos of actual surgical procedures.
Clinical content for each case is developed in close collaboration with leading orthopedic surgeons and radiologists at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
This course will contain videos, photographs, and other content, including anatomical images and videos showing cadaver dissection, that some people may find offensive, disturbing or inappropriate.

8.EFTx is an online version of MIT's graduate Effective Field Theory course. The course follows the MIT on-campus class 8.851 as it was given by Professor Iain Stewart in the Fall of 2013, and includes his video lectures, resource material on various effective theories, and a series of problems to facilitate learning the material. Anyone can register for the online version of the course, and students at MIT or Harvard can also register for 8.S851 for course credit.
Effective field theory (EFT) provides a fundamental framework to describe physical systems with quantum field theory. In this course you will learn both how to construct EFTs and how to apply them in a variety of situations. We will cover the majority of the common tools that are used by different effective field theories. In particular: identifying degrees of freedom and symmetries, formulating power counting expansions (both dimensional and non-dimensional), field redefinitions, bottom-up and top-down effective theories, fine-tuned effective theories, matching and Wilson coefficients, reparameterization invariance, and various examples of advanced renormalization group techniques. Examples of effective theories we will cover are the Standard Model as an effective field theory, integrating out the massive W, Z, Higgs, and top, chiral perturbation theory, non-relativistic effective field theories including those with a large scattering length, static sources and Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET), and a theory for collider physics, the Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET).
Course Flow
Since this is an advanced graduate physics course, you will find that self motivation and interaction with others is essential to learning the material. The purpose of the online course is to set you up with a foundation, to teach you to speak the language of EFT, and to connect you with other students and researchers that are interested in learning or broadening their exposure to this subject. Each week you will complete automatically graded homework problems to test your understanding and to help you master the material. You are expected to discuss the homework with other people in the class, but your online responses must be done individually. To facilitate these interactions there will be a forum for student-to-student discussions, with threads to cover different topics, and moderators with experience in this field. Student learning and discussions will also be prompted by questions posed after each lecture topic.
There will be no tests or final exam, but at the end of the course each student will give a 30 minute presentation on an EFT topic of their choosing. The subject of effective field theory is rich and diverse, and far broader than we will be able to cover in a single course. The presentations will create an opportunity for you to learn about additional subjects beyond those in lecture from your fellow students. To facilitate this learning opportunity, each student will be required to watch and grade eight presentations from among their fellow students. Of these eight, you will view 5 presentations that will be chosen for you, and you will view at least 3 more that you choose yourself from among the available topics.
Since this is a graduate course we anticipate that learning the subject, and having the 8.EFTx materials available as an online resource will be more valuable to most of you than obtaining a grade. Therefore anyone who registers for the course will be able to retain access to the course materials after the course has ended. Since some of you may find a grade useful, we will compute a grade for everyone by using a combination of homework problems (50%) and your final research presentation project (50%).  For many of the course elements you may work at your own pace. The presentation project will be due December 16th.  For those following the suggested schedule there is a one-week break over the Christmas &amp; New Years holiday, and two homework problems that are due in January.
FAQ
What do I have to buy in order to participate in the course?
Nothing. All edX courses are free.
The lectures, homework, and lecture notes are all available online.
Will certificates be awarded?
Yes. Online learners who achieve a passing grade in 8.EFTx will earn for free a certificate of mastery.
These certificates will indicate you have successfully completed the course, but will not include a specific grade.
Certificates will be issued by edX under the name of MITx.
What textbook do I need for the course?
In 8.EFTx readings will be mainly from a latex version of the lecture notes and freely available online arXiv research articles.
Occasionally additional reading from commonly available quantum field theory textbooks will be suggested to supplement these free sources.
When can I watch the lectures?
You can watch the lectures any time at your leisure.
Can I register to the class after the start date has passed?
Yes, you can register at any time between the start date and the end date.
To obtain the certificate, however, you will have to get at least 60% of the total available points for the class.
I don't have the prerequisites. Can I still take the course?
We do not check students for prerequisites, so you are certainly allowed to try.
However, 8.EFTx does depend on experience with quantum field theory.
Who can register for this course?
Unfortunately, learners from Iran, Sudan, Cuba and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time.
While edX has received a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to offer courses to learners from Iran, Sudan and Cuba, our license does not cover this course.
Separately, EdX has applied for a license to offer courses to learners in the Crimea region of Ukraine, but we are awaiting a determination from OFAC on that application.
We are deeply sorry the U.S. government has determined that we have to block these learners, and we are working diligently to rectify this situation as soon as possible.To Identify degrees of freedom and symmetries

化学与社会课程的授课对象是非科学类本科生，课程的内容涵盖了化学基础和应用的诸多方面。本课程的目标是：培养和提高非科学类学生的科学素养，使学生掌握一些基本的化学知识，对化学家思考问题、解决问题的方法有所了解，拓展学生的视野和知识面，理解当今人类社会所面临的若干重大挑战与化学之间的关联，进而有助于学生自身的职业发展。
化学与社会的主要内容包括化学基本概念、有机化学、高分子化学、材料化学、环境化学、地球化学、能源化学、生物化学、食品化学、医药化学和日用化学等。在课程的开始阶段，将简要介绍一些基本的化学概念和常识，然后依次介绍化学的一些重要分支以及它们在社会生活中的广泛应用。
化学起源于古老的神秘主义。东方道家和西方炼金术士们在追求长生不老和无尽财富的过程中奠定了实验化学的基础，发展出一套比较系统的化学实验方法和设备。尽管金丹术士们没有实现他们最初的目标，但是他们却取得了一个更为伟大的成就，那就是化学作为一门科学诞生了。
化学以理论和实验为基础，面向广阔的应用领域，经过三百多年的发展，已经成为人类文明的支柱学科。回顾人类发展史，几乎每个文明时期的标志性进展都与化学家的贡献密切相关。冶铁技术、人工合成氨技术、橡胶和塑料的合成以及纳米材料都最先出自化学家之手，因此毫不夸张地讲，化学是人类文明的基石。
化学与社会这门课的目的不是培养化学家，而是介绍化学及其成就，描述这门学科的过去、现在和未来。因此，这门课程就像是一艘“观光飞船”，带着同学们俯瞰这片神奇的领域，沿途领略化学中最具代表性的区域。通过学习化学与社会，学生不仅仅可以学到一些基本的化学知识，也可以对化学学科的历史和现状、化学与社会的关系、目前化学领域的某些热点问题以及化学的未来前景有一个轮廓式的了解。

Teaching object non-scientific and social class undergraduate chemistry curriculum, course content covers many aspects of basic and applied chemistry. The objective of this course is to: develop and improve non-science students' scientific literacy so that students have some basic knowledge of chemistry, chemists thinking, problem solving understanding, expand their horizons and knowledge, understanding today Several major challenges facing human society association between the chemical and, thereby contribute to students' own career development.
The main content of the chemical and the basic concepts of society, including chemical, organic chemistry, polymer chemistry, materials chemistry, environmental chemistry, geochemistry, energy, chemistry, biochemistry, food chemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry and household chemistry. At the beginning of the course, will briefly introduce some basic concepts and knowledge of chemistry, followed by some important branches of chemistry, and they are widely used in social life.
Chemical originated in ancient mysticism. East and West Taoist alchemists in pursuit of immortality and endless wealth in the process laid the foundation for chemistry experiments, to develop a more systematic method and apparatus for chemical experiments. Although saver warlocks do not realize their initial goal, but they made one more great achievement, it is a chemical used as a science was born.
Chemistry with theoretical and experimental basis for the broad application areas, after three hundred years of development, has become a pillar disciplines of human civilization. Recalling the history of human development, almost iconic during the progress of each civilization are closely related to the contribution of chemists. Metal fabrication technology, artificial ammonia technology, synthetic rubber and plastics and nano materials are first hand from the chemist, and therefore no exaggeration to say that the chemical is a cornerstone of human civilization.
The purpose of this course is not the culture and society of chemical chemist, but describes the chemical and its achievements, describing the discipline's past, present and future. Therefore, this course is like a "tourist spaceship", with students overlook this magical area, along a taste of the chemical in the most representative area. Through the study of chemistry and society, students can not only learn some basic knowledge of chemistry, the relationship can be the history and status quo of chemistry, chemical and society, current and future prospects of some hot issues in the field of chemistry and the chemical has a contour Formula understanding.人文和社科类学生的化学课程

计算机是现代社会中用于解决问题的重要工具。利用计算机解决实际问题需要将问题抽象，并对数据进行操作，最后通过计算机程序求解问题。而本门课程主要内容就是对以上内容进行研究。
图灵奖获得者N.Wirth写了一本经典著作“程序=算法+数据结构”。数据结构，是抽象的表示数据的方式；算法，则是计算的一系列有效、通用的步骤。算法与数据结构是程序设计中相辅相成的两个方面。
我 们会围绕着“算法+数据结构=程序”的思路，以问题求解为导向进行学习。希望能够帮助大家提高理论、抽象、设计的能力。在扎实的经典理论基础上，运用问题 抽象、数据抽象、算法抽象来分析问题，应用适当的数据结构和算法来设计和实现相应的程序。通过课程学习，大家的抽象思维能力、问题求解能力将得到较大提 升，编程能力和代码质量会有质的飞跃！
在求解实际问题方面，我们会学习到通过权衡时空和其他资源开销，利用数据结构来组织数据、设计高效的算法、完成高质量的程序以满足错综复杂的实际应用需要。
此外，课程所学到的内容会被利用到计算机科学后续的各个课程中，如操作系统、软件工程、数据库概论、编译技术、计算机图形学、人机交互等。希望可以为大家将来从事计算机相关的学习、研究和开发工作打下扎实的基础。
本课程采用张铭主编的国家“十一五”规划教材《数据结构与算法》（高等教育出版社）。适合计算机以及相关理工专业的大二本科生学习，需要先修过计算概论等课程，具有结构化和面向对象的程序设计基础。
课程主要包括的内容有：线性表，栈与队列，字符串，二叉树，树，图，排序（内排序，外排序），检索，索引，高级数据结构、以及数据结构应用。课程持续16周（分为两个session，每个8周），学习者每周在本课程上需要投入4－8小时。
本课程的本次开设得到Google研究经费支持。
Computers are an important tool for problem solving and are deeply involved in modern life. Computers perform operations on data. What is the logical relationship among data? How is data stored in computers? What algorithms are required to solve particular problems? These are the questions that will be answered in “Data Structures and Algorithms,” an important core course in Computer Science. The course also introduces students to fundamental data structures and classical algorithms used in more specialized courses, including Operating Systems, Software Engineering, Database Systems, Compiler Principles, Computer Graphics and Human Computer Interaction.
Niklaus Wirth described the important and indivisible link between algorithms and data structure in his book, Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs.
The course will build on Wirth’s ideas as it helps students improve their knowledge of theory and their ability to think abstractly to solve problems. Building on a solid theoretical foundation, students will analyze problems using data and algorithm abstraction. Students will learn how to organize data efficiently and make tradeoffs between space and time complexity, design efficient and effective algorithms, and implement high quality programs to solve complex real-world problems. After studying this course, students will be well prepared for further study and research in engineering and other computer-related areas.
This is an intermediate-level course appropriate for sophomore students majoring in computer science or other science/engineering disciplines. Students should have learned "introduction to computing", with the knowledge of structured and object-oriented programming.
This course is presented in two eight-week sessions.
Students who score 60% or higher will receive an Honor Code Certificate.
The Autumn 2014 Sessions of this course are supported by Google.

This course, the first installment of the multi-part Poetry in America series, covers American poetry in cultural context through the year 1700. The course begins with Puritan poets--some orthodox, some rebel spirits--who wrote and lived in early New England. Focusing on Anne Bradstreet, Edward Taylor, and Michael Wigglesworth, among others, we explore the interplay between mortal and immortal, Europe and wilderness, solitude and sociality in English North America.
Led by Harvard Professor Elisa New, Poetry in America surveys nearly 400 years of American poetry. Through video lectures, archival images and texts, expeditions to historic sites, interpretive seminars with large and small groups, interviews with poets and scholars, and conversations about poems with distinguished Americans, Poetry in America embarks on a journey through the literature of a nation. Distinguished guests, including President Bill Clinton, Elena Kagan, Henry Louis Gates, Eve Ensler, John McCain, Andrea Mitchell, Michael Pollan, Drew Faust, Tony Kushner, and Nas, among others, bring fresh perspectives to the study of American Poetry.

Globalization is a fascinating spectacle that can be understood as global systems of competition and connectivity. These man-made systems provide transport, communication, governance, and entertainment on a global scale. International crime networks are outgrowths of the same systems. Topics include national identity, language diversity, the global labor market, popular culture, sports and climate change.
However, an increase in integration has not brought increased equality. Globalization creates winners and losers among countries and global corporations, making competition the beating heart of the globalization process.
The globalization process exemplifies connectivity. Globalization is unimaginable without the unprecedented electronic networks that project dominant cultural products into every society on earth.

The last century ushered in significant progress. Philosophers, scientists, artists, and poets overthrew our understanding of the physical world, of human behavior, of thought and its limits, and of art, creativity, and beauty. Scientific progress improved the way we lived across the world. Yet the last century also brought increased levels of war, tyranny, and genocide. Man pushed boundaries of good and evil, right and wrong, justice and injustice – and people lost faith in values. Now, thinkers and leaders are reconstructing theories of value and creating institutions to embody them. Join this thought-provoking, broad-sweeping course as it draws intriguing connections between philosophy, art, literature, and history, illuminating our world and our place in it.

This course is Part II of a two-part mathematical introduction to the mechanics and control of robots that can be modeled as kinematic chains. Topics covered include the concept of a robot’s configuration space and degrees of freedom, static grasp analysis, the description of rigid body motions, kinematics of open and closed chains, and the basics of robot control. The emphasis is not on the latest research trends and technological innovations in robotics, but on learning the fundamental concepts and core principles that underlie robotics as a scientific discipline. The intent is to help students acquire a unified set of analytical tools for the modeling and control of robots, together with a reliable physical intuition that recognizes the unique and interdisciplinary nature of robotics—in short, content that will serve as a reliable foundation for whatever trends may appear later, and remain relevant to both the practitioner and researcher. NOTE: Part II will cover screw motions and the product of exponentials kinematics formula, inverse kinematics of open chains, velocity kinematics and statics, closed chain kinematics, and basics of robot control.The basics of robot control

Statistics 2 at Berkeley is an introductory class taken by about 1,000 students each year. Stat2.3x is the last in a sequence of three courses that make up Stat2x, the online equivalent of Berkeley's Stat 2. The focus of Stat2.3x is on statistical inference: how to make valid conclusions based on data from random samples. At the heart of the main problem addressed by the course will be a population (which you can imagine for now as a set of people) connected with which there is a numerical quantity of interest (which you can imagine for now as the average number of MOOCs the people have taken). If you could talk to each member of the population, you could calculate that number exactly. But what if the population is so large that your resources will not stretch to interviewing every member? What if you can only reach a subset of the population?
Stat 2.3x will discuss good ways to select the subset (yes, at random); how to estimate the numerical quantity of interest, based on what you see in your sample; and ways to test hypotheses about numerical or probabilistic aspects of the problem.
The methods that will be covered are among the most commonly used of all statistical techniques. If you have ever read an article that claimed, "The margin of error in such surveys is about three percentage points," or, "Researchers at the University of California at Berkeley have discovered a highly significant link between ...," then you should expect that by the end of Stat 2.3x you will have a pretty good idea of what that means. Examples will range all the way from a little girl's school science project (seriously – she did a great job and her results were published in a major journal) to rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court.
The fundamental approach of the series was provided in the description of Stat2.1x and appears here again: There will be no mindless memorization of formulas and methods. Throughout the course, the emphasis will be on understanding the reasoning behind the calculations, the assumptions under which they are valid, and the correct interpretation of results. </description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>1091</course_id><title>Mechanics ReView</title><published_date>2014-04-16T16:16:54-04:00</published_date><course_length>15 weeks</course_length><effort>8 hours/week</effort><subject>Engineering</subject><price>FREE</price><level>Introductory</level><school>MITx</school><language>English</language><url>https://www.edx.org/course/mechanics-review-mitx-8-mrevx</url><status>Future Dates To Be Announced</status><instructors><instructor><name>David E.

Mechanics ReView is a second look at introductory Newtonian Mechanics. It will give you a unified overview of mechanics that will dramatically increase your problem-solving ability. It is open to all students who meet the prerequisites (see right), but is especially designed for teachers and students who want to improve their existing understanding of mechanics.
Newtonian mechanics is the study of how forces change the motion of objects. This course begins with force, and moves on to straight-line motion, momentum, mechanical energy, rotational motion, angular momentum, and harmonic oscillators. Optional units include planetary orbits and a unit whose problems require multiple concepts to be applied to obtain one solution.
NOTE: New Section “Problem-solving Pedagogy”
We have developed a special approach to organizing the physics content knowledge and for applying it when solving problems.  This approach is called “Modeling Applied to Problem Solving” and has been researched carefully and has proven effectiveness for improving students’ performance in a later physics course on Electricity and Magnetism.
If you are a teacher looking to improve your knowledge of mechanics, or to learn new approaches to teach your students, we encourage you to sign up in the special teacher section featuring a discussion forum for teachers to discuss teaching ideas and techniques related to the topics discussed in this course.  To join these discussions,  verify yourself as a teacher, and we will sign you up in the teacher forum.
Note that this forum is exclusively reserved for teachers, so please do not register if you are not a teacher.
Teachers in the United States, and especially in Massachusetts, can receive extra benefit from this course. We offer Professional Development Points (PDPs) at no charge to teachers in Massachusetts who complete our course. If you are in a different state, we instead offer Continuing Education Units through the American Association of Physics Teachers. There is a fee for this certificate.
Course Syllabus
Note: Taking this Course Involves Using Some Experimental Materials
The RELATE group that authors and administers this course is an education research group, dedicated to understanding and improving education, especially online.  We showed that 8.MReV generated slightly more conceptual learning than a conventionally taught on-campus course  - but we were unable to find exactly what caused this learning.   (So far this is the only published measurement of learning in a MOOC).  This summer we will be comparing learning from different types of online activities that  will be administerered to randomly assigned sub-groups of our students.  At certain points in the course, new vs. previously used sequences of activities will be assigned to different groups.  We will then use common questions to compare the amount learned. Which group receives the new activities will be switched so that neither group will have all new activities.
Our experimental protocol has been approved by the MIT Committee on Use of Human Subjects.  As part of this approval we have the obligation to inform you about these experiments and to assure you that:
We will not divulge any information about you that may be identified as yours personally (e.g. a discussion post showing your user name). 
The grade for obtaining a certificate will be adjusted downwards (from 60%) to compensate if one group has harder materials.
Note: By clicking on the registration button, you indicate that you understand that everyone who participates in this course is randomly assigned to one of the groups described above. 
Welcome, and we hope you will both learn from and enjoy this course.
FAQs
Is there a required textbook?
You do not need to buy a textbook. All material is included in this edX course and is viewable online. If you would like to use a textbook with the course (for example, as a reference), most calculus-level books are suitable. Introductory physics books by Young and Freedman, Halliday and Resnick, or Knight are all appropriate (and older editions are fine).
  What if I take a vacation?
The course schedule is designed with this in mind! Course contents are released four weeks ahead of the deadline, so even if you have a four-week vacation, you do not need to miss any deadlines and can still complete all of the material.
  Will I get a certficiate?
Yes! This course awards certificates to all who satisfactorily complete the required portion of the course.
  How are grades assigned?
There are three parts of the course that are worth points: Checkpoint problems that are folded in with the reading, Homework problems that come at the end of each unit, and Quizzes that are at the end of every 1-2 units. Each is worth a varying number of points, and you will not have to do every problem.
The course consists of 11 required units and three optional units. You do not need to complete the optional units in order to receive a certificate.

EECS149.1x introduces students to the design and analysis of cyber-physical systems --- computational systems that are integrated with physical processes. Applications of such systems include medical devices and systems, consumer electronics, toys and games, assisted living, traffic control and safety, automotive systems, process control, energy management and conservation, environmental control, aircraft control systems, communications systems, instrumentation, critical infrastructure control (electric power, water resources, and communications systems for example), robotics and distributed robotics (telepresence, telemedicine), defense systems, manufacturing, and smart structures.
A major theme of the course is on the interplay of practical design with formal models of systems, including both software components and physical dynamics. A major emphasis will be on building high confidence systems with real-time and concurrent behaviors. Students will apply concepts learned in lectures to programming a robotic controller in a specially-designed virtual laboratory environment with built-in automatic grading and feedback mechanisms.
This edX course is an online adaptation of the UC Berkeley undergraduate course EECS 149, covering a subset of topics that are especially relevant for the lab component of that class.Gain an understanding of the design and analysis of computational systems that are integrated with physical processes

This is an introductory astronomy survey class that covers our understanding of the physical universe and its major constituents, including planetary systems, stars, galaxies, black holes, quasars, larger structures, and the universe as a whole. We will learn how modern astronomical observations and applications of physics we know from the planet Earth reveal the nature of these objects and explain their observed properties, and tell us how they form and evolve. We will also examine various cosmic phenomena, from variable or exploding stars to the expansion of the universe and the evidence for dark matter, dark energy, and the big bang. The universe as a whole and all of its major constituents are evolving, and we now have a fairly complete and consistent picture of these processes that is based on the objective evidence from observations and the laws of physics. The goal of this class is both to learn about the fascinating objects and phenomena that populate the universe, and to understand how we know all that.Gain an understanding of the physical universe, including planetary systems, stars, galaxies, black holes, quasars, larger structures, and the universe as a whole

Statistics 2 at Berkeley is an introductory class taken by about 1000 students each year. Stat2.2x is the second of three five-week courses that make up Stat2x, the online equivalent of Berkeley's Stat 2.
The focus of Stat2.2x is on probability theory: exactly what is a random sample, and how does randomness work? If you buy 10 lottery tickets instead of 1, does your chance of winning go up by a factor of 10? What is the law of averages? How can polls make accurate predictions based on data from small fractions of the population? What should you expect to happen "just by chance"? These are some of the questions we will address in the course.
We will start with exact calculations of chances when the experiments are small enough that exact calculations are feasible and interesting. Then we will step back from all the details and try to identify features of large random samples that will help us approximate probabilities that are hard to compute exactly. We will study sums and averages of large random samples, discuss the factors that affect their accuracy, and use the normal approximation for their probability distributions.
Be warned: by the end of Stat2.2x you will not want to gamble. Ever. (Unless you're really good at counting cards, in which case you could try blackjack, but perhaps after taking all these edX courses you'll find other ways of earning money.)
The fundamental approach of the series was provided in the description of Stat2.1x and appears here again: There will be no mindless memorization of formulas and methods. Throughout the course, the emphasis will be on understanding the reasoning behind the calculations, the assumptions under which they are valid, and the correct interpretation of results.

Too much mathematical rigor teaches rigor mortis: the fear of making an unjustified leap even when it lands on a correct result. Instead of paralysis, have courage: Shoot first and ask questions later. Although unwise as public policy, it is a valuable problem-solving philosophy and the theme of this course: how to guess answers without a proof or an exact calculation, in order to develop insight.
You will learn this skill by mastering six reasoning tools---dimensional analysis, easy cases, lumping, pictorial reasoning, taking out the big part, and analogy. The applications will include mental calculation, estimating population growth rates, understanding drag without differential equations, singing musical intervals to estimate logarithms, approximating integrals, summing infinite series, and turning differential equations into algebra.
Your learning will be supported by regular readings that you discuss with other students, by short tablet videos, by quick problems to help you check your understanding, by weekly homework problems, review and and a final exam. You will work hard, and, by the end of the course, have learned a rough-and-ready approach to using mathematics to understand the world.
All required readings are available within the courseware, courtesy of The MIT Press. A print version of the course textbook, Street-Fighting Math, is also available for purchase. The MIT Press is offering enrolled students a special 30% discount on books ordered directly through the publisher’s website. To take advantage of this offer, please use promotion code SFM30 at The MIT Press. 
FAQ
Do I need to buy a textbook?
Back in 2010, MIT Press agreed to publish the textbook, *Street-Fighting Mathematics*, under a free license (in print and online).
Thus, the book is legally available all over the internet, including on this course platform.
As a registered student in this course, you can also purchase a printed book from MIT Press at a discount.
Do you often get into street fights?
The last time was in high school, when I was attacked for being “different” and suspended for fighting back.
However, in my problem-solving fights (and now that I’m older!), I regularly use reasoning tools and we’ll do the same in this course. </description></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>1096</course_id><title>United States Health Policy</title><published_date>2013-12-20T12:23:23-05:00</published_date><course_length>13 weeks</course_length><effort>4 hours/week</effort><subject>Health &amp; Safety</subject><price>FREE

Many Americans complain that they do not understand the U.S. health reform law called the Affordable Care Act (or Obamacare). They are right, and the main reason is because most Americans do not understand the basics of the U.S. health care system and U.S. health policy. Featuring some of the nation’s foremost teachers and thought leaders, this course provides students with a basic and thorough understanding of the U.S. health care system focusing on access, quality of care, and costs. Students will learn how the system is structured, how care is organized, delivered, and financed, and how the Affordable Care Act will influence the future of the system. Students will understand the U.S. health policy making structure process at the federal, state, and local levels. Students who complete this course will be able to interpret current controversies around US health policy and develop informed opinions on future policy developments.

This course provides a mathematical introduction to the mechanics and control of robots that can be modeled as kinematic chains. Topics covered include the concept of a robot’s configuration space and degrees of freedom, static grasp analysis, the description of rigid body motions, kinematics of open and closed chains, and the basics of robot control. The emphasis is not on the latest research trends and technological innovations in robotics, but on learning the fundamental concepts and core principles that underlie robotics as a scientific discipline. The intent is to help students acquire a unified set of analytical tools for the modeling and control of robots, together with a reliable physical intuition that recognizes the unique and interdisciplinary nature of robotics—in short, content that will serve as a reliable foundation for whatever trends may appear later, and remain relevant to both the practitioner and researcher. This course is the first of two parts of “Robot Mechanics and Control.” Part II will start shortly after completion of Part I.Robot configuration space and degrees of freedom

How does cellular technology enable massive surveillance? Do users have rights against surveillance? How does surveillance affect how we use cellular and other technologies? How does it affect our democratic institutions? Do you know that the metadata collected by a cellular network speaks volumes about its users? In this course you will explore all of these questions while investigating related issues in WiFi and Internet surveillance. The issues explored in this course are at the intersection of networking technology, law, and sociology and will appeal to anyone interested in the technical, political, and moral questions inherent in the use of information networks. The course will include broad overviews for the novice, while pointing to the detailed resources needed for those engaged in the development of corporate or governmental policies.
FAQ
Is there a required textbook?
No. A list of supplemental resources, including textbooks, will be provided. The textbook, Cellular Convergence and the Death of Privacy, is optional.
How much time will I spend on the course during the week?
Expect to spend 4-8 hours per week. This depends on a number of factors, including how much you want to engage with the material and the level of understanding you desire.
Do I need to have taken an electrical and computer engineering course before?
No. Though there will be discussion of electrical and computer engineering (ECE) ideas, the professor will assume no prior ECE training.
I am not familiar with U.S. or European history but I am interested in how the law regarding cell phones works. Can I take this course?
Yes. I will have relevant links to helpful background material for each section that should make it possible for those with no knowledge of U.S. or European history to take the class.
Is this class about building a network?
This class is primarily about how historical privacy law has made it possible for current information technologies to be used to collect data and conduct surveillance rather than how to build a network. While the course will touch on important engineering developments and information technology uses, this class will focus more on the intersection of networking technology, law, and sociology. If you want to know how cell phones collect data and why this data can be used in court, this is the class for you.
Will certificates be awarded?
Yes. If you complete the work and achieve a passing grade in the course, you can earn a Honor Code Certificate, which indicates that you have completed the course successfully.

We are surrounded by information, much of it numerical, and it is important to know how to make sense of it. Stat2x is an introduction to the fundamental concepts and methods of statistics, the science of drawing conclusions from data.
The course is the online equivalent of Statistics 2, a 15-week introductory course taken in Berkeley by about 1,000 students each year. Stat2x is divided into three 5-week components. Stat2.1x is the first of the three.
The focus of Stat2.1x is on descriptive statistics. The goal of descriptive statistics is to summarize and present numerical information in a manner that is illuminating and useful. The course will cover graphical as well as numerical summaries of data, starting with a single variable and progressing to the relation between two variables. Methods will be illustrated with data from a variety of areas in the sciences and humanities.
There will be no mindless memorization of formulas and methods. Throughout Stat2.1x, the emphasis will be on understanding the reasoning behind the calculations, the assumptions under which they are valid, and the correct interpretation of results.
FAQ
What is the format of the class?
Instruction will be consist of brief lectures and exercises to check comprehension. Grades (Pass or Not Pass) will be decided based on a combination of scores on short assignments, quizzes, and a final exam.
How much does it cost to take the course?
Nothing! The course is free.
Will the text of the lectures be available?
Yes. All of our lectures will have transcripts synced to the videos.
Do I need to watch the lectures live?
No. You can watch the lectures at your leisure.

Alexander the Great conquered most of the world known to the ancient Greeks, fused the eastern and western peoples of his empire, and became a god – before his 33rd birthday. This course explores the life, leadership, and legacies of history’s warrior, and one of its most controversial leaders, an ambiguous genius whose story helps us to understand not only the history of warfare, but also different ideas about human sexuality, the history of relations between east and west, and the religious beliefs both of ancient polytheists and modern monotheists.

This introductory course has the same rigor as the regular M.I.T. course of the same name, which is one of the first subjects in M.I.T.'s Mechanical Engineering undergraduate curriculum.
In this course, students will learn to analyze and predict the dynamic behavior of objects and systems, their motions and associated forces, and understand mechanical systems of complexity that are representative of engineering practice.  Students will also analyze the kinematics of mechanisms, understand torque and angular momentum in rigid bodies in rotation, and imbalance in rotating systems. Finally students will derive nonlinear equations of motion for a wide variety of mechanical systems, solve them using numerical methods in MATLAB as well as plot and interpret results.
The course combines a unique blend of rigor and realism to produce fundamental skills in an accessible, entertaining format.

We live on the surface of a dynamic and yet paradoxically stable planet that experiences a remarkable range of energetic phenomena, from waves and currents in the ocean to wind and thunderstorms in the atmosphere. This course traces how the remarkable concept called energy is the natural way of describing, understanding and unifying these diverse phenomena. The course traces the cascade of energy from sunlight to its final destination in a thermal form, considering differential surface heating, the role of convection and buoyancy and the formation of the Earth’s circulation system, and the links to the ocean circulation system. We consider the curvature and rotation of the Earth as key constraints on a system driven by sunlight and energy transformations.

How much time will the course take?
Obviously the answer will depend on your background and motivation to master the course material. Each week will consist of 5 or 6 segments that will each take 5 to 10 minutes to watch or listen to once. There will be some exploratory questions for each lesson and a confirmation quiz for each week. There will be one exploratory activity for each week. The average commitment will be 2-3 hours per week with perhaps 20 hours required for the whole course.
What background does the course assume?
We’ll ask you to pull out a calculator from time to time (but not all the time!) simply as this will help you really master the key ideas. The key thing is to have a curiosity and interest in what makes our planet tick!
What kind of learning activities will the course involve?
The activities are designed to use basic household objects, and our own senses, to engage with observations of the world, and to think about what these mean and lead to. We’ll get you to sense how cold or warm different objects get when left in the sun, and to observe how energy explains things we see and hear.
What difference will the course make to my life?
The course has the conviction that it is hard to care for or value things that we don’t appreciate or have never considered. Although harsh in certain places and times, the Earth’s surface is remarkably habitable. Many forms of life can make their way in many kinds of terrain and climate. What produces these conditions? How are they maintained? We will seek to answer those questions in rudimentary form at least.
What conversations will the course help to perform?
Courses often imagine a context in which the course material is discussed, and this one is no different. It imagines a setting with family or friends where you might have just learned of a news event involving a storm like a hurricane or thunderstorm, or where a community might have experienced a flood or a drought, or merely unusual weather. You might have heard of El Nino or climate change in the news. This course will give you a background to better engage in a conversation about these great matters, and offer a better sense of the complexity, challenge and wonder connected to living on the surface of such an energetic planet.How energy is transformed in its movement around the earth

Addressing students' interests in 20th century Western Music Culture and incorporating music theory, the course examines 20th century Western music. By combining theory and practice, the course not only aims to provide a clear view of the historical development of the music, but also emphasizes the training of aural skills and the accumulation of musical knowledge. The course covers not only classical music, such as neo-classical, expressionism, nationalism and other genres, but also explores in depth jazz, rock, and pop music of the 20th century. While studying Chinese music and other forms of national folk music in the 20th century world music context, students will also analyze large and complex works such as opera, musicals, and film music. By enhancing students’ understanding of 20th century Western music (classical music, pop music, folk music, comprehensive art) as a foundation, three core questions will be addressed: what is music, what is the 20th century Western music, and what is effective listening? The course aims to guide students to examine the three listening modes of 20th century Western music with the hope of forming a diverse and multi-faceted, knowledge and understanding of the 20th-century Western music culture phenomena, expanding students’ horizons, enhancing their ability to reason by analogy, and promoting cross-disciplinary, creative development.
The course is one of the PKU-DeTao MOOCs, which is a joint effort by Peking University and DeTao Masters Academy. 该课程是“北大-德稻网络开放课程”中的一门，由北京大学与德稻教育联合提供。

Will I fail to keep up in the course due to my lack of understanding about the field of music?
Our content is adjusted to a general audience. 

课程是否会因在音乐领域积累不足而无法跟进？
教师依照课程核心，一方面给出清晰课程线索，跟进不难，另一方面，教师尽可能调整课程内容，照顾到全体情况。根据以往的经验，课程结束，同学均可跟进课程标准，且不乏各样收获。
Are there content knowledge pre-requisites for this course?
An earnest desire to learn and a proactive, professional attitude are more important than prior knowledge of content matter. The learners are expected to absorb the basic content points quickly and use them as a base for further learning.

课程内容秉持怎样的上课标准？
教师保持一贯上课理念，认为专业，关于态度，不关乎知识，不会因同学不同程度，顾左右言其他，忽略最核心最关键知识点及问题的涉及。
Which is more important for this course, knowledge or ability?
This course is most concerned on the development of music listening ability, though some knowledge of music will be helpful. 
课程重视知识还是能力？
课 程最关心音乐聆听能力的发展，在提供行之有效聆听技术的同时，安排适当知识内容的传授。加之考试不重知识，而重能力，因此，课程中因教室光线不足而造成无 法做太多笔记，恰恰是教师所希望的。课后传发同学的曲目说明，其中所标出的知识点，所指系能力而非知识。在音乐领域，所谓历史是听觉样本，即艺术品本身积 累起来的，而非人名和作品名串联起来的。艺术史，是感觉的历史，不是文字描述的历史。
What is the aim of the music puzzle assignment within the course?
The purpose of the assignment is to prepare and develop audiometry and memory skills.

课程所谓音乐拼图作业的目的是什么？
作 业的目的，在于听觉甄别力和记忆力的筹备与发展。相当于我们小时候玩得拼图或积木游戏，从局部观察到整体把握，这一训练所形成的对线条、形状、色泽等构成 物的甄别与记忆，不仅是视觉所需，也是发达听觉所必备。多数情况下，类似课程作业的练习，在中国音乐课程中，很少会有。之所以课程一开始便这样做，是因为 知道学生听觉的普遍问题。不少同学在实践之初，会遇到困难，这很正常，如果没有做好接受困难的准备，也就不必来此课程分享，也就不必来北大读书了。
Will the course provide information about music composition and technology?
No. Music composition mastery requires long-term training, usually at a conservatory level.

课程是否可能或可以提供关于作曲的知识与技术？
课 程不可能在作曲方面给予单独帮助，通过目前的教学方式，尽管正在探索，教师只能也必须照顾到最大多数同学的需求，这一难处，是客观的，请多谅解。关于作曲 四大件的技术发展，在音乐学院有一套完整的训练程序，乐理是入门，和声是基础，二者建立关于调性音乐系统的初阶。随后的复调写作，作曲系耗时约需一年甚至 更多，根据全面仿作练习，帮助同学发展多声思维和多声部操控技术。配器是第三梯度，约需一年时间完成，全面掌握乐队法。曲式分析，是封顶收官之课。将之前 所有梯队课程的内容，一并总结。
Will the course be available in English?
The videos in the course will include English subtitles. However, the rest of the course content will only be available in Mandarin.
这门课程使用英语授课吗？
视频中教师使用中文授课，有英文字幕，但是课程的其他内容，如阅读、作业题、讨论等都只用中文。什么是20世纪西方音乐

Quantum computation is a remarkable subject building on the great computational discovery that computers based on quantum mechanics are exponentially powerful. This course aims to make this cutting-edge material broadly accessible to undergraduate students, including computer science majors who do not have any prior exposure to quantum mechanics. The course starts with a simple introduction to the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics using the concepts of qubits (or quantum bits) and quantum gates. This treatment emphasizes the paradoxical nature of the subject, including entanglement, non-local correlations, the no-cloning theorem and quantum teleportation. The course covers the fundamentals of quantum algorithms, including the quantum fourier transform, period finding, Shor's quantum algorithm for factoring integers, as well as the prospects for quantum algorithms for NP-complete problems. It also discusses the basic ideas behind the experimental realization of quantum computers, including the prospects for adiabatic quantum optimization and the D-Wave controversy.

Quantitative Methods in Clinical and Public Health Research is the online adaptation of material from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health's classes in epidemiology and biostatistics. Principled investigations to monitor and thus improve the health of individuals are firmly based on a sound understanding of modern quantitative methods. This involves the ability to discover patterns and extract knowledge from health data on a sample of individuals and then to infer, with measured uncertainty, the unobserved population characteristics. This course will address this need by covering the principles of biostatistics and epidemiology used for public health and clinical research. These include outcomes measurement, measures of associations between outcomes and their determinants, study design options, bias and confounding, probability and diagnostic tests, confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, power and sample size determinations, life tables and survival methods, regression methods (both, linear and logistic), and sample survey techniques. Students will analyze sample data sets to acquire knowledge of appropriate computer software. By the end of the course the successful student should have attained a sound understanding of these methods and a solid foundation for further study.
