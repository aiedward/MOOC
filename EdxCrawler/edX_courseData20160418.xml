However, at the university level and in industry, we learn that science is not as simple as we once thought. We are constantly confronted by questions about the unknown and required to use creative, integrated approaches to solve these problems. By bringing together knowledge from multidisciplinary fields, we are empowered with the ability to generate new ideas. The goal of this course is to develop skills for generating new ideas at the interface between chemistry and biology by analyzing pioneering studies.</description><learn_about>How to generate ideas for research and business

Unfortunately, lending money is a risky business - there is no 100% guarantee that you will get all your money back. If the borrower defaults, you will face losses in your portfolio. Or, in a bit less extreme scenario, if the credit quality of your counterparty deteriorates according to some rating system, the loan will become more risky. These are typical situations in which credit risk manifests itself.</description><learn_about>The definition and the implications of credit risk for banks and other financial institutions

Throughout the case studies, we will make use of exploratory plots to get a general overview of the shape of the data and the result of the experiment. We start with RNA-seq data analysis covering basic concepts of RNA-seq and a first look at FASTQ files. We will also go over quality control of FASTQ files; aligning RNA-seq reads; visualizing alignments and move on to analyzing : counting reads in genes; Exploratory Data Analysis and variance stabilization for counts; count-based differential expression; normalization and batch effects. Finally, we cover : inferring expression of transcripts (i.e. alternative isoforms); differential exon usage. We will learn the basic steps in analyzing DNA methylation data, including reading the raw data, normalization, and finding regions of differential methylation across multiple samples. The course will end with a brief description of the basic steps for analyzing ChIP-seq datasets, from read alignment, to peak calling, and assessing differential binding patterns across multiple samples.</description><learn_about>Mapping reads

Teniendo en cuenta lo anterior, se pretende generar un espacio para comprender cómo el ser humano desarrolla y adquiere las habilidades de lectura y escritura así como las dificultades más comunes en su adquisición, desde una perspectiva neuropsicológica y cognitiva. Esto, con el fin de ofrecer pautas para identificar cuándo un niño presenta alguna o varias de estas dificultades y qué hacer para ayudarlo en su correcta apropiación.</description><learn_about>Reconocer las implicaciones en la adquisición del proceso de la lecto-escritura en la etapa escolar, desde una aproximación neuropsicológica.</learn_about><url>https://www.edx.org/course/aproximacion-neuropsicologica-de-la-javerianax-puj-e-1601x-06</url></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>course-v1:NYIF+RMPC1.2x+1T2016</course_id><title>Measuring Risk: Equity, Fixed Income, Derivatives and Forex</title><published_date>2016-03-07T10:25:14-05:00</published_date><course_intro>Understand how to describe the various approaches utilized for determining value at risk.</course_intro><subject>Subject: Economics &amp; Finance</subject><level>Level: Intermediate</level><school>Institution: New York Institute of Finance</school><description>This economics and finance course is a survey of risk measures and risk measurement practices applied to individual securities and portfolios.

Ce questionnement d’ordre général peut trouver une première réponse dans l’étude historique de la confrontation entre christianisme et philosophie dans l’Antiquité. Cette confrontation a joué un rôle très important dans la constitution de la doctrine chrétienne. Elle prend la forme d’une polémique entre les chrétiens et les philosophes, mais également d’un rapprochement, les chrétiens reprenant à la philosophie un grand nombre de concepts et de modes de raisonnement pour penser, exprimer et défendre leur foi. On verra ce qui oppose le christianisme et la philosophie comme deux voies d’accès concurrentes à la vérité, avant d’envisager différents aspects de la dette du christianisme à l’égard de la philosophie antique. On se demandera pour finir quel a été le rôle du christianisme dans l’histoire de la philosophie en tant que telle.</description><learn_about>Analyser la constitution de la doctrine chrétienne dans le cadre de la confrontation entre le christianisme et la philosophie dans l’Antiquité

This novel is remarkable for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that Shelley wrote the novel when she was only 18 years old.

Frankenstein is a representation of both the Gothic and Romantic movements, and is often considered to be one of the earliest novels of science fiction as well. This story has had a huge influence on literature and popular culture, and has generated many adaptations in the forms of movies and plays.  The first film adaptation, in fact, appeared in 1910.

Participants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion. Course materials will include background information for understanding the text, as well as vocabulary and language support. Assessment will include quizzes and short writing assignments.

Calculus is an elementary Mathematical course in any Science and Engineering Bachelor. Pre-university Calculus will prepare you for the Introductory Calculus courses by revising four important mathematical subjects that are assumed to be mastered by beginning Bachelor students: functions, equations, differentiation and integration. After this course you will be well prepared to start your university calculus course. You will learn to understand the necessary definitions and mathematical concepts needed and you will be trained to apply those and solve mathematical problems. You will feel confident in using basic mathematical techniques for your first calculus course at university-level, building on high-school level mathematics. We aim to teach you the skills, but also to show you how mathematics will be used in different engineering and science disciplines.</description><learn_about>Understand, visualize and manipulate different elementary functions, like powers, roots, polynomials, trigonometric functions, exponential and logarithmic functions.

La ecuación química representa lo que sucede cuando tiene lugar un proceso en el que unas sustancias se convierten en otras mediante una “reacción química”.

En las reacciones se cumple la ley de la conservación de la masa y es posible calcular las cantidades de reactivos que reaccionan y de productos que se obtienen.
 
El estudio de las reacciones químicas y de los aspectos cuantitativos de las mismas, es decir su “estequiometría”, es competencia de la Química, una materia básica que se estudia en muchas titulaciones Universitarias.
 
Este curso va dirigido a los alumnos que acceden a la Universidad, especialmente aquellos que no han cursado Química y que requieren de los conocimientos básicos en estos aspectos.

The story received little very public interest when it first appeared. In fact, only eleven complete copies of  1887 are known to exist. Many adaptations of Sherlock Holmes exist, however, and he continues to fascinate readers as an enigmatic detective.

This is the story of Dracula's move from Transylvania to England to find new blood and spread the curse of the undead. It also introduces the now-famous character of Professor Abraham Van Helsing.

The novel is categorized in many different ways: vampire, horror, and gothic fiction. It also addresses concepts such as women in Victorian culture, colonialism, sexuality, and post-colonialism. Although Stoker was not the first writer to tell the story of a vampire, he is credited for giving the vampire its modern form. This story has been adapted to many different forms in film and theater.

Comment la politique économique peut-elle rétablir ou contribuer à la bonne santé d’un pays ? Ces questions sont au cœur de la programmation financière. Nos cours de PPF (Programmation et politiques financières) vous permettront d’acquérir les bases nécessaires pour y répondre.
 
La programmation financière est un cadre qui permet d’analyser l’état actuel de l’économie, de prévoir la direction qu’elle prend, et de déterminer les politiques économiques qui peuvent en changer le cours.
 
La première partie du cours de PPF, présentée par l’Institut du FMI pour le développement des capacités, vous permettra d’acquérir les compétences de base indispensables pour mener à bien la programmation financière. Dans ce cours, vous découvrirez les principales caractéristiques des quatre grands secteurs macroéconomiques (réel, financier, extérieur et monétaire), vous apprendrez comment lire, interpréter et analyser les comptes de chacun d’eux, et vous comprendrez à quel point ils sont interdépendants.
(La deuxième partie du cours de PPF portera sur la formulation de projections de base et l’élaboration d’un programme d’ajustement.)
 
Au long de ce cours, les économistes du FMI vous guideront dans les comptes et dans l’analyse d’une économie. En outre du suivi de conférences sous forme de vidéos, vous serez appelés à répondre à des questions sur les concepts expliqués, à résoudre de brefs exercices pratiques, à réfléchir avec les autres participants sur l’évolution économique de votre pays, et à travailler sur les données d’un pays imaginaire. Les dossiers de lecture vous seront fournis.
 
Que vous soyez un cadre de la fonction publique chargé de dossiers économiques pour votre pays ou que votre travail repose sur l’exploitation de données économiques, ou tout simplement si vous souhaitez mieux comprendre l’évolution économique d’un pays, ce cours vous apportera une formation pratique en analyse macroéconomique, et nous attendons avec intérêt votre participation à ce fascinant apprentissage!

How have urbanisation, mobility, digital spaces, and globalization changed the way we perceive it? This course aims to help you feel comfortable with the notion of space. The simplest way to understand it is to connect your daily life, your perceptions and your practices to the concepts of contact and remoteness. In SpaceX, we will explore together the city, urbanisation, urbanity, and urbanism, the individual actor in a globalising World, the emerging digital spatialities, the space-time couple, and the complex relation between societies and bio-physical worlds. Moreover, we will see that cartography is a powerful tool. By the end of the course, we will enable you to not only read but also draw your own maps. Finally, the issues of action on space through spatial agency and spatial justice will be addressed. In each of the nine sessions, a recognised specialist will be filmed in a particular place—a ‘thinking place’—throughout the World, to help us simultaneously inhabit and understand space.</description><learn_about>A greater understanding of space as perception and daily-life practice.

However, this novel is most remembered for its depiction of health violations and unclean conditions in the American meatpacking industry.

These findings were based on an investigation Sinclair did as a journalist..  Sinclair spent several weeks gathering information while working in the meatpacking plants of the Chicago stockyards for the newspaper . was first published in serial form in 1905 in the newspaper. A film version of the novel was made in 1914, but it has been lost.

The novel highlights working class poverty, the lack of social support, harsh living and working conditions, and a bleak outlook for the working poor. This is contrasted with the corruption of those in power.

Dive into the heart of the psychological mechanisms at play in negotiations.  </course_intro><subject>Subject: Business &amp; Management</subject><level>Level: Introductory</level><school>Institution: LouvainX</school><description>Souvent confinée à l’étude des techniques permettant de vendre une encyclopédie en 24 volumes à une octogénaire récalcitrante ou à l’art de marchander son salaire, la négociation est souvent abordée sous un angle exclusivement utilitariste. Mais négocier ce n’est pas se limiter à la recherche du bénéfice maximum. La négociation traverse toutes les dimensions de la vie humaine. Nous négocions tous les jours, dans toutes les sphères de notre existence : au travail, avec la famille, les amis… Dès qu’il s’agit de partager des biens matériels mais aussi de résoudre une divergence d’intérêts, de concilier différentes envies, rêves, goûts, couleurs…
 
Ce cours s’éloigne de l’approche classique des négociations et tente de rendre compte des phénomènes psychologiques à la base du comportement. L’approche poursuivie sera descriptive plutôt que prescriptive. Contrairement aux théoriciens du jeu qui « examinent ce que de super-hommes, ultra-intelligents et impeccablement rationnels devraient faire dans les situations compétitives », nous explorerons la façon dont « des êtres imparfaits se comportent dans la réalité » (Raïffa, 1982, p. 21). Ainsi, les êtres humains poursuivent des motivations, ont des attentes, des préjugés, des biais et des émotions. Ils analysent l’information qui leur est soumise et prennent des décisions à travers le spectre de leurs propres limites cognitives. Leurs actions fluctuent en fonction de la situation ou de leur personnalité. Toutes ces variables influencent non seulement le comportement des personnes mais, plus fondamentalement, elles modifient la dynamique même de résolution des divergences. Ce cours mettra en évidence ces variables multiples et offrira aux étudiants une compréhension fine et détaillée des processus psychologiques qui entrent en jeu avant, pendant et après toute négociation.

But what makes a good learning game? Where do ideas come from and how do you create them? These are the questions that this course tries to answer.
The premise of learning games from some perspectives seems like a perfect and easy solution - get people to learn things they don’t want to by motivating them through game play. To others it seems like an oxymoron - if learning is hard then it can’t possibly be fun at the same time. The key to designing good learning games is to reconcile these perspectives by creating games that focus on creating environments based on “hard fun.” This idea will be a central tenet of this course.</description><learn_about>Characteristics of a “learning game” and an understanding of ways that games can provide meaningful experiences

You see them every day: on clocks, in the stock market, in sports, and all over the news. Algebra is all about figuring out the numbers you don't see. You might know how fast you can throw a ball, but can you use this number to determine how far you can throw it? You might keep track of stock prices, but how can you figure out how much money you've made (or lost) in the market? And you may already know how to tell time, but can you calculate at what times a clock's hour and minute hands are  aligned? With algebra, you can answer all of these questions, using the numbers you already know to solve for the . Algebra is an essential tool for all of high school and college-level math, science, and engineering. So if you're starting out in one of these fields and you haven't yet mastered algebra, then this is the course for you!

Along the way, you'll learn a few different ways to find the area of a triangle, you'll discover a shortcut for counting the number of stones in the Great Pyramid of Giza, and you'll even come up with your own estimate for the size of the Earth.

Perhaps there are no more salient topics in the information age and the global economy than a comprehensive understanding of how learning takes place and what predicts and determines human behavior. The course is a primer, meant to provide substantive content through which to understand the human condition and to inspire students to continue their learning and growth.
 
Students interested in the study of psychology are interested in why people do, say and think what they do. They have questions about how learning takes place, how genetics dictate certain traits but not others, how memories are formed, where to draw the line between normality and disorder, whether a damaged brain can regain function and the predictors of addiction.
 
Through this introductory course, students will have the opportunity to understand the science of psychology and how psychologists measure mental function and behavior and how the results are reported. They will better understand perception and consciousness and the mysteries of sleep and dreams. Through child development, they will understand how the brain is ready for learning and pre-wired for language. Motivation, cognition and personality will be analyzed through the lens of past and current psychological thought. Students will understand the statistical reality of the normal distribution and how that is relevant to most traits. They will review new research on the plasticity of the brain and consider whether intelligence is fixed or flexible. Lastly, the array of disorders and dysfunction will be analyzed and discussed and the line between normal and abnormal will be considered.</description><learn_about>An understanding of what psychology is and its history

During this process of change, the capital of a military empire that once invaded East Asia experienced occupation by the U.S. armed forces, hosted the Olympic Games, and transformed into a consumer hub where young people could enjoy economic “wealth.” It is important to know that this process was recorded in countless photographs, documentary films, TV programs, and so on. We will retrieve many of these archived pictures and videos and analyze what happened in postwar Tokyo from different perspectives. In Part 1, you will look at the changes that occurred in postwar Tokyo over a quarter of a century from four different perspectives: 1) occupation and Americanism; 2) imperial gaze and royal wedding; 3) The Olympic city; and 4) economic-cultural clash in Shinjuku. This examination of urban history will provide you with the insights necessary when considering changes in other large cities in Asia, such as Seoul, Beijing, and Bangkok, at the end of the twentieth century.</description><learn_about>Noteworthy factors which promoted the development and change of Tokyo in the postwar period

In postwar Tokyo, countless gazes fell upon others; gazes from and upon Americans and the Emperor, gazes going up skyscrapers or rushing aggressively through the cityscape, and gazes twining and wriggling among classes, genders, and ethnic groups in downtown Tokyo. In Part 2, we will focus on the geopolitics of these gazes in modern Tokyo. What kinds of gazes fell upon the war orphans, the poor, and the marginalized groups in Tokyo? How did students themselves, who represented the vast accumulation of knowledge in Tokyo, perform in front of these gazes? Moreover, how did cinema or television shows, as media for these gazes, implicate the whole city? In answering these questions, we will identify the geopolitics historically involved in the practice of “visualizing postwar Tokyo.”</description><learn_about>The way of the dynamic exchange of gazes in postwar Tokyo from different perspectives

In this introduction to ancient Greek culture and literature, learners will experience, in English translation, some of the most beautiful works of ancient Greek literature and song-making spanning over a thousand years from the eighth century BCE through the third century CE: the Homeric and ; tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides; songs of Sappho and Pindar; dialogues of Plato, and by Philostratus. All of the resources are free and designed to be equally accessible and transformative for a wide audience.

You will gain access to a supportive learning community led by Professor Gregory Nagy and his Board of Readers, who model techniques for “reading out” of ancient texts. This approach allows readers with little or even no experience in the subject matter to begin seeing this literature as an exquisite, perfected system of communication.

This is a hands-on, learn-by-doing course that shows you how to build solutions to real-world problems using embedded systems. The course uses a bottom-up approach to problem solving, building gradually from simple interfacing of switches and LEDs to complex concepts like display drivers, digital to analog conversion, generation of sound, analog to digital conversion, graphics, interrupts, and communication. We will present both general principles and practical tips for building circuits and programming the microcontroller in the C programming language. You will develop debugging skills using oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, and software instrumentation. Laboratory assignments are first performed in simulation, and then you will build and debug your system on the real microcontroller.

Participants in the course will follow seventeen lessons, each of which will present a mix of science (no prerequisites!) and the broader, relevant cultural surround.  Or we might be looking at the philosophical roots and philosophical consequences of Einstein’s works.  At other times we will be fully engaged with historical and political questions: the building, dropping, and proliferation of nuclear weapons, for example. 
 
Typically, in a lesson (about an hour of streamed material), there will be opportunities for individual mini-essay writing, some multiple choice questions to bolster your understanding of the science, and a group activity which might one week be a debate and another a collective commentary on elements of an artwork from 1920s Weimar Germany.   </description><learn_about>Through the life and work of Albert Einstein, the changing role of physics in the 20th and 21st centuries.

The questions we will take up include: Is extreme poverty a thing of the past? What is economic life like when living under a dollar per day? Are the poor always hungry? How do we make schools work for poor citizens? How do we deal with the disease burden? Is microfinance invaluable or overrated? Without property rights, is life destined to be "nasty, brutish and short"? Should we leave economic development to the market? Should we leave economic development to non-governmental organizations (NGOs)? Does foreign aid help or hinder? Where is the best place to intervene? And many others.

At the end of this course, you should have a good sense of the key questions asked by scholars interested in poverty today, and hopefully a few answers as well.</description><learn_about>To identify and analyze some of the root causes of underdevelopment using principles of economics

The first goal of the course is to gain a detailed understanding of the structure and function of the fundamental building blocks of the mammalian brain, its synapses and neurons. The second goal is to understand neuronal networks, with specific emphasis on the interactions of excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic neurons.

Some place the origin of dogs over 100,000 years ago; others place the start of dogs just 12,000 years ago. Claims for the location of the origin of dogs range from China to Europe and many places in between.

How are contracts formed? What makes a contract enforceable? What happens when one party breaks a promise?</course_intro><subject>Subject: Law</subject><level>Level: Intermediate</level><school>Institution: HarvardX</school><description>Learn about contracts from Harvard Law Professor Charles Fried, one of the world’s leading authorities on contract law. Contracts are promises that the law will enforce. But when will the law refuse to honor a promise? What happens when one party does not hold to their part of the deal?

We are exposed to contracts in all areas of our life — agreeing to terms when downloading a new computer program, hiring a contractor to repair a leaking roof, and even ordering a meal at a restaurant. Knowing the principles of contracts is not just a skill needed by lawyers, it illuminates for everyone a crucial institution that we use all the time and generally take for granted.

This contract law course, with new materials and updated case examples, is designed to introduce the range of issues that arise when entering and enforcing contracts. It will provide an introduction to what a contract is and also analyze the purpose and significance of contracts. Then, it will discuss the intent to create legal relations, legality and morality, and the distinction between gifts and bargains. The course also investigates common pitfalls: one-sided promises, mistake, fraud, and frustration. With the knowledge of what makes contracts and how they can go wrong, Professor Fried will discuss remedies and specific performance. Finally, Professor Fried will introduce how contracts can create rights for third parties. 

The course’s instructor, Charles Fried, has been teaching at Harvard Law School for more than 50 years and has written extensively on contracts. Not only is Professor Fried a leading authority on contract law, but he also utilizes a story-telling approach to explaining the topic, which creates a unique and interesting class experience.</description><learn_about>A theoretical background of contracts, trust, and promise

This novel was first published as a serial novel in Lippincott’s Monthly Magazine in 1890.

The Picture of Dorian Gray was immediately controversial, and was censored by the magazine’s editors. Even with the censorship, reviewers still thought that Wilde ought to have been prosecuted for violating laws concerning public morality. This story has two important themes: the idea of selling one’s soul, and the theme of living a double life. Wilde takes these themes to their extreme.

While the development of cities in different parts of the world is moving in diverse directions, all estimations show that cities worldwide will change and grow strongly in the coming years. Especially in the tropics over the next 3 decades, it is expected that the number of new urban residents will increase by 3 times the population of Europe today. Yet already now, there is an extreme shortage of designers and urban planners able to understand the functioning of a city as a system, and to plan a sustainable and resilient city. To answer questions like: Which methods can contribute to the sustainable performance of a city, and how can we teach this to the next generations, the ETH Future Cities Laboratory in Singapore has produced over the last 3 years many necessary research results. “Future Cities” aims to bring these latest results to the places where they are needed most.</description><learn_about>Explore the city as the most complex human-made “organism” with a metabolism that can be modeled in terms of stocks and flows

Beginning with a discussion of the dramatic change in historians’ interpretations of the period in the last two generations, the course goes on to discuss how Reconstruction turned on issues of continued relevance today. Among these are: who is an American citizen and what are citizens’ rights; what is the relationship between political and economic freedom; which has the primary responsibility for protecting Americans’ rights – the federal or state governments; and how should public authorities respond to episodes of terrorism? The course explores the rewriting of the laws and Constitution to incorporate the principle of equality regardless of race; the accomplishments and failings of Reconstruction governments in the South; the reasons for violent opposition in the South and for the northern retreat from Reconstruction; and the consolidation at the end of the nineteenth century of a new system of white supremacy.</description><learn_about>The dramatic change in historians’ interpretations of the period in the last two generations

This course is divided into two parts. In the first part (), we explored the various properties of signals and systems, characterization of Linear Shift Invariant Systems, convolution and Fourier Transform. Building on that, in this part (EE210.2x) we will deal with the Sampling theorem, Z-Transform, discrete Fourier transform and Laplace transform. The contents of the first part are prerequisites for doing this part. Ideas introduced in this course will be useful in understanding further electrical engineering courses which deal with control systems, communication systems, power systems, digital signal processing, statistical signal analysis and digital message transmission. The concepts taught in this course are also useful to students of other disciplines like mechanical, chemical, aerospace and other branches of engineering and science.</description><learn_about>How to analyze the effect of sampling

Este curso va dirigido a los alumnos que acceden a la Universidad, especialmente aquellos que no han cursado Química y que requieren de los conocimientos básicos en estos aspectos.
 
En este curso aprenderás a identificar los tipos de enlace que pueden presentarse en los diferentes compuestos químicos y a predecir qué tipo de enlace predomina en un compuesto en base a las características de los elementos que lo constituyen. Así mismo, podrás deducir qué enlace presenta un compuesto observando sus características y comportamiento. Profundizarás en el estudio del enlace covalente y entenderás la relación entre las interacciones moleculares y las propiedades físicas de los compuestos. En definitiva, adquirirás las habilidades necesarias para reconocer todo tipo de enlaces y relacionar la estructura de un compuesto con las propiedades físicas que manifiesta.

This course provides an introduction to traditional Chinese ethical thought and focuses on the pervasive contrast in the way Chinese and Westerners think about ethical guidance or guidance concerning what is right and what is wrong, good or bad.  Traditional Western orthodoxy uses the metaphor of a law – in its most familiar popular form, the command of a supernatural being backed by a threat of eternal punishment or reward – to explain ethical guidance. The Classical Chinese philosophers by contrast were all naturalists. They talked about ethical guidance using a path metaphor – a natural dào.</description><learn_about>Describe various conceptions of the relation between humanity and nature presented in classical Chinese philosophical thought

This course is designed to give students a thorough introduction to early (pre-221 BCE) Chinese thought, its contemporary implications, and the role of religion in human well-being. Important themes to be discussed include the ideal of wu-wei or “effortless action,” the paradox of how one can consciously try not to try, mindfulness techniques and self-cultivation, models of the self and society, rationality versus emotions, trust and human cooperation, and the structure and impact of different spiritual and political ideals.</description><learn_about>Later developments in Confucianism and Daoism

The Call of the Wild is a 1903 novel written by Jack London. The story is set in the Yukon, the far northern territory of Canada/Alaska, during the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush. During this period, good sled dogs were in high demand. The novel's main character is a dog named Buck, who lives on a California ranch.

London himself lived nearly a year in the Yukon, collecting material for the novel. Like many older popular novels, was serialized in the in the summer of 1903. A month later, it was released as a  book. The novel’s great popularity and success made London famous. The appeal of this story comes from its simplicity as a tale of survival. As early as 1908, the story was adapted to film. Since then, there have been other adaptations.

Participants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion. Course materials will include background information for understanding the text, as well as vocabulary and language support. Assessment will include quizzes and short writing assignments.</description><learn_about>Read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence

Energy subsidies are an issue in practically every country in the world. Pre-tax subsidies, which arise when energy consumers pay less than the supply cost of energy, are high in many emerging and developing economies, and have risen in recent years. Although pre-tax subsidies are not a large enough problem in advanced economies to cause fiscal difficulties, these countries have tax subsidies, where the taxes imposed on energy are not high enough to account for all of the adverse effects of excessive energy consumption, including on the environment. The issue of energy subsidy reform is not new. Despite widespread recognition of their adverse consequences, energy subsidies have proven difficult to reform.</description><learn_about>How to measure energy subsidies

This is an interactive course about the basic concepts of Systems, Control and their impact in all the human activities. First, the basic concepts of systems, dynamics, structure and control are introduced. Then, looking at many examples in Nature and human made devices, we will realize that the dynamic behavior of most systems can be modified by adding a control system. Later we will see how knowing how to evaluate the dynamic behavior of a system and measure its performance will provide the tools to design new controlled systems fulfilling some requirements.

By considering which are the benefits of control and the challenges for the future we will open the mind to tackle new applications and develop new scenarios from the micro-systems level to the common systems and the whole universe. An overview of the techniques available for a deeper introduction to the subject will be presented at the end.

Control technology is said to be a hidden technology. We do not notice it under normal operation, but it appears if a failure happens. Looking around in Nature and at human made devices, we realize that their behavior presents analogies and that we can manipulate their temporal evolution.

Characterizing the dynamic behavior of systems and the possibility to change it by introducing control devices is the main aim of the course. You will learn to analyze the dynamic properties of a system and the options to change its behavior according to some requirements.You will learn the basic concepts to undertake further studies in control engineering and its use in a variety of disciplines, from human and social sciences to any engineering field. </description><learn_about>You will learn to analyze the dynamic properties of a system and the options to change its behavior according to some requirements.

The business landscape is changing so rapidly that traditional management, business and computing courses do not meet the needs for the next generation of workers in the business world. Most traditional methods are of a repetitive, rule-based nature and will be gradually replaced by Artificial Intelligence. In the knowledge era, the most value added job will be to manage knowledge, which includes how knowledge is created, mined, processed, shared and reused in different trades and industry. At the same time, the amount of data and information (prerequisites of knowledge) is exploding exponentially. By 2020, IDC projects that the size of the digital universe will reach 40 zetabytes from all sources including, websites, weblog, sensors, and social media. Big data will transform how we live, work and even think. These trends and more will have a profound effect on how we see the world and create policies. In this course, the following topics are covered:</description><learn_about>Understand the role of Knowledge Management (KM) practitioners in creating business value.
Become familiar with the techniques and tools for capturing, processing, classifying and organizing knowledge.
How to analyze large quantities of data and information  through analytics.
Understand the role of social media and technologies in innovating new business services.

The use of English for doing business in multinational settings is a fact of life for many business people. As Asian economies expand and become more involved in the global economy, a lingua franca – a language used to communicate among groups of people who do not share a mother tongue – is needed to exchange information. This course has two goals. The first is to introduce non-native speakers of English to methods for developing spoken English language and communication skills for doing business in Asia. The second is to examine the impact of interculturality and globalization on English communications. By exploring and participating in a business simulation set in Asia, you will develop the principal skills for effective communication in English when conducting business in China and other Asian countries.</description><learn_about>Pronounce sounds clearly and use rhythm appropriately and persuasively

Interrupted time series analysis and regression discontinuity designs are two of the most rigorous ways to evaluate policies with routinely collected data. ITSx comprehensively introduces analysts to interrupted time series analysis (ITS) and regression discontinuity designs (RD) from start to finish, including definition of an appropriate research question, selection and setup of data sources, statistical analysis, interpretation and presentation, and identification of potential pitfalls.
 
At the conclusion of the course, students will have all the tools necessary to propose, conduct and correctly interpret an analysis using ITS and RD approaches. They will also develop a real-life research proposal that could form the basis of future research. This will help them position themselves as a go-to person within their company, government department, or academic department as the technical expert on this topic.
 
ITS and RD designs avoid many of the pitfalls associated with other techniques. As a result of their analytic strength, the use of ITS and RD approaches has been rapidly increasing over the past decade. These studies have cut across the social sciences, including:</description><learn_about>The strengths and drawbacks of ITS and RD studies

Pourquoi respirons-nous ? A quoi servent nos poumons ? Quel est le lien entre l’oxygène et la vie ? Ces questions ouvrent un vaste champ de découvertes et de curiosités pour mieux comprendre la  respiration. Ce cours s’adresse à toute personne qui souhaite apprivoiser, s’approprier ou approfondir le fonctionnement de la respiration et des poumons, autrement dit la physiologie respiratoire humaine.
 
Plongés au cœur de l’université et de la pratique hospitalière, durant  sept semaines, vous côtoierez professeurs, professionnels de la santé, internes et étudiants de médecine. Vous y apprendrez des notions de niveau universitaire qui ont été sélectionnées et adaptées afin que toute personne intéressée puisse les comprendre et y donner du sens. Ainsi, nous aborderons des thèmes proches du monde qui vous entoure : la respiration lors d’un effort physique, en altitude, le rôle des polluants atmosphériques, l’asthme….
 
A chaque leçon, un expert abordera des domaines concrets et pratiques : comment apprécier l’oxygénation d’un patient, pourquoi lui administrer de l’oxygène, que signifie hyperventiler….
 
Ce cours vous fera entrer en profondeur dans un monde où l’atmosphère est faite d’anatomie humaine, de physique des volumes et des pressions, de gaz et de sang, d’oxygène et de CO2, de poumons et de tissus, de tabagisme et de bronchite chronique.
 
Au terme de ce cours, vous serez capables de</description><learn_about>Expliquer et décrire les principes d’oxygénation, de ventilation, de transport et de consommation d’oxygène, de diffusion de gaz entre l’air et le sang par des schémas et par des calculs utilisant des formules fondamentales

Le politique nous concerne tous : chaque jour, des décisions publiques sont adoptées qui impactent notre quotidien. Dans quel contexte ces décisions sont-elles adoptées ? Au 21ème siècle, de nombreux paradoxes brouillent la vision que nous pouvons en avoir. Qu’est-ce que le pouvoir dans la société actuelle ? Quels acteurs en détiennent ? L’État demeure-t-il un acteur politique majeur s’il est concurrencé par des organisations internationales et régionales ? Comment la démocratie prônée par la communauté internationale se différencie-t-elle des régimes autoritaires voire totalitaires ? Quelle est la place des idéologies dans le monde actuel ?

Politics of Freedom: The Civil War, 1861-1865 narrates the history of the American Civil War. While it examines individual engagements and the overall nature of the military conflict, the focus is less on the battlefield than on political, social, and economic change in the Union and the Confederacy. Central to the account are the road to emancipation, the role of black soldiers, the nature of Abraham Lincoln’s wartime leadership, internal dissent in both the North and South, the changing position of women in both societies, and the war’s long-term economic and intellectual impact. We end with a look at the beginnings of Reconstruction during the conflict.</description><learn_about>no info</learn_about><url>https://www.edx.org/course/civil-war-reconstruction-1861-1865-new-columbiax-hist1-2x</url></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>course-v1:PrincetonX+CEE262.1x+1T2016</course_id><title>The Art of Structural Engineering: Bridges</title><published_date>2015-09-22T09:37:31-04:00</published_date><course_intro>Learn about bridge design and discover how structural engineering is a creative discipline and art form.</course_intro><subject>Subject: Engineering</subject><level>Level: Introductory</level><school>Institution: PrincetonX</school><description>This is an Archived Course

Banking and financial markets encompass the ‘ecosystem’ that (a) channelizes money from those who have it (i.e., savers/investors) to those who need it (i.e., borrowers) and (b) facilitate cross-border flow of funds through exchange of currencies. That ecosystem of banks and financial markets (including Central Banks) has deepened in size, sophistication and complexity over the years. However, in recent times they have also been the subject of abuse, failures and economic distress in several countries resulting in a ‘contagion’ that has concurrently impacted several countries around the World! </description><learn_about>The theory and concepts underlying banking and financial markets and the ‘symbiotic’ relationship between the two

This global health and life sciences course enables learners to investigate health problems affecting large populations – the whole world in fact! By understanding the big numbers in global mortality and their causes and distributions you will learn how to think numerically about global health. We will use real data from real people to ask the questions: What are the major causes of death in the world? Why do we need cause of death statistics? How does counting the dead help the living?
 
We begin with a historical perspective on global mortality and end with a hopeful look toward future trends. In between, you will learn about how death prior to old age can be avoided, worldwide mortality rates, and specific diseases such as HIV, malaria, childhood conditions, chronic diseases, and risk factors such as smoking. This course will help you use population statistics to understand how rapid gains in health are possible.</description><learn_about>What major factors drive changes in health

This course provides a quantitative and model-based introduction to basic economic principles, and teaches how to apply them to make sense of a wide range of real world problems. Examples of applications include predicting the impact of technological changes in market prices, calculating the optimal gasoline tax, and measuring the value of new products. This is a real Caltech class. It will be taught concurrently to Caltech and on-line students. This has two implications. On the costs side: the class is challenging, makes extensive use of calculus, and will demand significant effort. On the benefit side: successful completion of the class will provide you with an in-depth understanding of basic economics, and will permanently change the way you see the world.</description><learn_about>Understand, apply, and analyze calculus-based economic models

Jane Eyre is a novel by English writer Charlotte Brontë. It was published in 1847 under her pen name, Currer Bell.

is often referred to as a , or coming-of-age story. It follows the feelings and experiences of the protagonist and title character, Jane Eyre, from youth to adulthood.  The story has both elements of social criticism as well as a strong moral core. Many critics have considered this book to be ahead of its time, mostly due to Jane’s individualism, as well as story themes that include classism, sexuality, religion, and feminism.

All over the world, including India, there is an aspiration that every student should be actively engaged in their learning. Achieving this aspiration demands highly skilled teachers and quality teacher education. 
 
This course introduces teacher educators to Open Educational Resources – freely available learning materials that can be adapted for use in particular contexts.  The course explores how you can use OER in the design and delivery of your teacher education programmes to help you bring about the transformation of classroom teaching and learning.   Throughout the course there will be a particular focus on the OER generated by TESS- India. These innovative multi-lingual text and video OER () aim to support teachers in developing participatory approaches through modelling links between theory and practice in classroom activities.   You will explore the values and pedagogy underpinning teacher education OER from TESS-India and other repositories and learn how you can adapt and incorporate these OER for your own contexts and students. 
 
Through participation in the course you will develop skills in locating, adapting and producing OER. Collaboration and the co-creation of OER will be key themes; you will be introduced to ways of working and open practices that you will be able to take forward into your professional working.  Through the course you may also form and strengthen your professional support network of fellow teacher educators. 
 
The course is designed primarily for teacher educators working in the Indian context in both pre-service and in-service education with primary and secondary school teachers in formal and informal programmes. However it has significant application for teacher educators globally. </description><learn_about>How to recognise and model active, learner-centred teaching approaches

Life on our planet is diverse. While we can easily recognize this in our everyday surroundings, an even more diverse world of life can be seen when we look under a microscope. This is the world of microorganisms. Microorganisms are everywhere, and although some are notorious for their roles in human disease, many play important roles in sustaining our global environment. We will explore these and in particular, those that thrive in the most extreme environments on our planet, the extremophiles.</description><learn_about>Basic principles of evolution

Hoy en día, más del 80 por ciento de la población en América Latina y el Caribe vive en zonas urbanas, y para el 2050 será casi el 90 por ciento. Esta creciente urbanización plantea desafíos importantes para los más de 15 mil municipios que existen en la región, exigiendo a los mismos hacer frente a las demandas de nuevos empleos, servicios urbanos, escuelas, transporte, viviendas y seguridad de forma consciente y planificada. Estas ciudades quieren avanzar hacia el desarrollo sostenible, buscando la manera de crecer económicamente, de forma inclusiva y respetando el medioambiente. ¿Pero cómo se avanza hacia el sueño de la sostenibilidad? ¿Cómo conseguimos crear actividad económica sin contaminar el aire y los ríos? ¿Cómo podemos crear riqueza y que los recursos lleguen a todas las personas? ¿Cómo hacer ciudades más seguras y participativas?
 
Para reflexionar sobre estas y otras preguntas, el BID ha creado un curso que busca fortalecer en los participantes las capacidades para gestionar el desarrollo sostenible de las ciudades, a través del dominio conceptual, procedimental y actitudinal de las principales áreas de competencia de la ciudad y de la herramienta de la Iniciativa Ciudades Emergentes y Sostenibles del BID, permitiéndoles desarrollar habilidades y construir estrategias innovadoras y multisectoriales para dar respuesta a los desafíos de la sostenibilidad.

This course will explore Jane Austen’s 1813 novel of manners,  Pride and Prejudice. Although the story of the Bennet sisters takes place at the turn of the 19th century, it still fascinates modern readers. One of the most popular books in the English language, consistently placing near the top of lists of "most loved books." Modern interest in the book has resulted in a number of adaptations for film and stage--since 1940, there have been four TV and movie versions of this book, as well as a plethora of spin-off books, including and .

Participants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion. Course materials will include background information for understanding the text, as well as vocabulary and language support. Assessment will include quizzes and short writing assignments.</description><learn_about>Read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence

We increasingly depend on reliable and affordable supply of energy, water, transport, telecommunication and information services to improve livability and facilitate economic development. However, today's infrastructure systems are drastically changing. They are becoming more and more web-based, interconnected and transnational, with increasingly fragmented public and private ownership, while new technologies are on their way. The capital need for investment in new infrastructures and upgrading of ageing infrastructures is tremendous.</description><learn_about>To diagnose the main challenges with respect to infrastructure (water, energy, transport, ICT) development for the future in a social-technical perspective

Have you ever wondered how information is transmitted using your mobile phone or a WiFi hotspot? This introductory course seeks to enable you to understand the basic engineering tools used and tradeoffs encountered in the design of these communication systems.  
 
This course is divided into three parts. In Part 1, we examine the point-to-point link, which communicates information from a single transmitter to a single receiver. Part 2 examines how multiple transmitters can share the same physical channel. Part 3 discusses how information can be transmitted reliably from one station to another over a network that connects multiple stations. Online interactive exercises are included to help build your intuition.

This course was inspired by and built upon the course 6.02 Digital Communication Systems developed at MIT, which Prof Bertram Shi worked on during his sabbatical in 2009.</description><learn_about>Learn how multiple transmitters can share the same physical channel.

The use of English for doing business in multinational settings is a fact of life for many business people. And, as Asian economies expand and become more involved in the global economy, having the ability to write clear and concise English is important when exchanging information. This course has two goals. The first is to introduce non-native speakers of English to methods for developing  English language and communication skills for doing business in Asia. The second is to examine the impact of cross-cultural interactions and globalization on English communications. By exploring and participating in a business simulation set in Asia, you will develop the principal skills for effective communication in English when conducting business in China and other Asian countries.</description><learn_about>Plan, research and structure a piece of writing according to the needs of a specific reader and purpose

The Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC) is a computer science principles course developed at the University of California, Berkeley, intended to broaden participation in computing to non-traditional groups. Computing has profoundly changed the world, opening up wonderful new ways for people to connect, design, research, play, create, and express themselves. However, just  a computer is only a small part of the picture. The real transformative and empowering experience comes when one learns how to  the computer, to translate ideas into code.</description><learn_about>The basics of computer programming using Snap!

When you're sick, you may wonder, "Why me?" But the real question should be, "Why am I not sick all the time?" You might even ask, "Why does my body respond with a fever, and is it really a good idea to lower it?" This course explores immunology, how the body defends itself from constant assault by parasites and pathogens. This course will present the fundamentals of both innate and adaptive immunity, emphasizing functional interactions among cells and organs. We will cover signaling, pathogen recognition and the division of labor among myeloid, lymphoid and supporting cells. The subject matter will also supply health professionals and biomedical researchers with the basic vocabulary and concepts necessary to understand both clinical press releases and primary literature. The course materials also provide support to other immunology instructors by presenting difficult concepts in creative ways using analogies and models.</description><learn_about>The importance of disease defense

A successful manager makes good decisions. To make good decisions, you need to understand the market forces that impact your business and personal life. This is true for managers in large multinationals or small businesses, in non-profit organizations or in the government. Individuals and households also make decisions. They decide on what to learn, where to work, how much to save, where to invest, and what goods to buy, among others. Most modern societies depend on markets to organize economic activity: they are market economies. A large number of decisions you make as individuals or as managers relate to markets. So it is important for you to know how markets work and how to make good decisions as a manager or as an individual operating in a market environment. This is what this course will teach you.</description><learn_about>How markets work; supply, demand and market equilibrium

Whether you are an EU citizen or not, this course concerns you! The EU is a major global actor in the field of human rights. EU treaties state that human rights are a fundamental value of the Union, which must be a ‘silver thread’ in all its policies. The EU now acts within an impressive array of competences, and therefore has the potential to impact – positively or negatively – anyone’s human rights.</description><learn_about>How the EU works

DNA encodes our genetic information and is passed on within cells to maintain living organisms and to produce the next generation. The recognition of DNA as the genetic material and the ensuing identification of its structure and coding mechanism were both revolutionary and foundational.  These discoveries led to transformational integration across the biological sciences with a common understanding of this fundamental unit of life! Join this exploration of DNA structure, packaging, replication, and manipulation.</description><learn_about>Methods that identified DNA as the genetic material

Over thirty years ago, confident in the superiority of American military power, the United States set out to "fix" the Greater Middle East. Since that time, U.S. troops, covert operatives and proxies have engaged in costly exertions in predominantly Muslim societies everywhere from the Levant and the Persian Gulf to East Africa and Central Asia. With what result? Washington's efforts have exacted a terrible toll, squandering vast amounts of blood and treasure. In the meantime, the Islamic world has become less stable while anti-American radicalism flourishes. America’s War for the Greater Middle East has failed, and that failure is irreversible.</description><learn_about>How the U.S. military engaged--and failed--in efforts to "fix" the Greater Middle East

Eating well and understanding the nuances of food has become a complicated and often confusing experience. Virtually every day brings news about some “miracle food” that we should be consuming or some "poison" we should be avoiding. One day it's tomatoes to prevent cancer, then flaxseed against heart disease or soybeans for menopause. At the same time, we are warned about trans fats, genetically modified foods, aspartame and MSG. Dietary supplements are often touted as the key to health or a factor in morbidity. According to some, dairy products are indispensable while others urge us to avoid them. The same goes for meat, wheat and soy; the list goes on.</description><learn_about>The foundations of a healthy diet

En un lugar de la UAM, cuyo nombre merece recordar, habita la España de El Quijote. 

Un espacio en el que su monarquía creó el primer imperio global de la Historia. Un tiempo, entre los siglos XVI y XVII, en el que su sociedad alcanzó la excelencia en las artes y las letras.

Aunque ese esplendor se dio en plenos aires de cambio. Pues España pasó de la hegemonía a la decadencia, de la expansión a la crisis.

Esta asignatura pretende trazar la historia de aquella época. Entre el Renacimiento y el Barroco su cultura marcó la pauta en Occidente. Las obras literarias -La Celestina, El Lazarillo, etc.- se tradujeron enseguida en las imprentas europeas y americanas. Las ropas marcaron la moda cortesana. La tendencia más fashion era “vestir a la española”. Los tratados militares y políticos fueron estudiados por los enemigos.

La acumulación de talentos en la Villa y Corte de Madrid (Cervantes, Lope, Velázquez, etc.), tuvo réplicas en las grandes ciudades de imperio. Pues en Sevilla, Lisboa, Barcelona, Nápoles, México o Lima se multiplicaron academias literarias, estrenos teatrales y fiestas. Una síntesis de pueblos unidos por la lealtad a la Corona y la fe católica.

En nuestro recorrido por esa España de  pasaremos de la campana al reloj y de la geografía fantástica a la real. La sociedad estuvo - Conocer la Historia de España en el Siglo de Oro a través de como hilo conductor.</description><learn_about>Conocer la Historia de España en el Siglo de Oro a través de El Quijote como hilo conductor

How can you help your students to see history as a living, breathing record of the past? How can you motivate students to ask probing questions and seek complex answers? How can you bridge their historical knowledge with a lifelong commitment to civic action?

With this course, middle and high school teachers will find new ways to engage students in and out of the classroom. Co-taught by Dr. Kathy Swan, Professor of Education at the University of Kentucky, and Naomi Coquillon, Manager of Youth and Teacher Programs at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History, this course will offer teachers useful and readily applicable strategies and tactics to incorporate inquiry-based learning methods into their existing history lessons.

The course brings together the new College, Career and Civic Life (C3) Framework for Social Studies with the Smithsonian’s hands-on, museum-based educational techniques that bring historical artifacts to life for millions of visitors each year. Through explanation, demonstration, and dynamic examples, the course offers teachers practical ideas for how to entice students to craft complex and incisive questions; think critically about primary and secondary historical sources; form and support their opinions with evidence; and communicate their conclusions in ways that will prepare them to be engaged citizens of the world. Demonstrations will feature the Smithsonian National Museum of American History’s exhibitions and vast collection of historical artifacts and will offer ideas and resources to help teachers everywhere incorporate object- and inquiry-based teaching techniques and Smithsonian online resources into their own classrooms.</description><learn_about>How to use and apply the inquiry arc of the C3 Framework for Social Studies, engaging students in a deeper process of historical inquiry

This course will explore A Study in Scarlet, an 1887 detective mystery novel by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. This novel introduced the iconic Sherlock Holmes and his friend Dr. John Watson. The book's title comes from a speech Holmes gives to Doctor Watson about his work, saying: "There's the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it."

The story received little very public interest when it first appeared. In fact, only eleven complete copies of  1887 are known to exist. Many adaptations of Sherlock Holmes exist, however, and he continues to fascinate readers as an enigmatic detective.

Participants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion. Course materials will include background information for understanding the text, as well as vocabulary and language support. Assessment will include quizzes and short writing assignments.</description><learn_about>Read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence

Robots today move far too conservatively, using control systems that attempt to maintain full control authority at all times. Humans and animals move much more aggressively by routinely executing motions which involve a loss of instantaneous control authority. Controlling nonlinear systems without complete control authority requires methods that can reason about and exploit the natural dynamics of our machines.

This course introduces nonlinear dynamics and control of underactuated mechanical systems, with an emphasis on computational methods. Topics include the nonlinear dynamics of robotic manipulators, applied optimal and robust control and motion planning. Discussions include examples from biology and applications to legged locomotion, compliant manipulation, underwater robots, and flying machines.</description><learn_about>no info</learn_about><url>https://www.edx.org/course/underactuated-robotics-mitx-6-832x-0</url></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>course-v1:ColumbiaX+HIST1.1x+3T2015</course_id><title>The Civil War and Reconstruction - 1850-1861: A Nation Divided</title><published_date>2015-08-20T12:14:35-04:00</published_date><course_intro>Discover how the issue of slavery came to dominate American politics, and how political leaders struggled and failed to resolve the growing crisis in the nation.</course_intro><subject>Subject: History</subject><level>Level: Introductory</level><school>Institution: ColumbiaX</school><description>This is an Archived Course

A House Divided: The Road to Civil War, 1850-1861 begins by examining how generations of historians have explained the crisis of the Union.  After discussing the institution of slavery and its central role in the southern and national economies, it turns to an account of the political and social history of the 1850s. It traces how the issue of the expansion of slavery came to dominate national politics, and how political leaders struggled, unsuccessfully, to resolve the growing crisis. We will examine the impact of key events such as Bleeding Kansas, the Dred Scott decision, the Lincoln-Douglas debates, and John Brown’s raid on Harper’s Ferry, and end with the dissolution of the Union in the winter of 1860-61.</description><learn_about>An overview of the political and social history of the 1850s

As contemporary humans, we are a product of our evolutionary past. That past can be directly observed through the study of the human fossil record, the materials preserved for archaeological study, and the DNA of living and extinct human populations. This course will provide an overview of human evolutionary history from the present--contemporary human variation in a comparative context--through our last common ancestor with the living great apes, some 5-7 million years in the past. Emphasis will be placed on major evolutionary changes in the development of humans and the methodological approaches used by paleoanthropologists and related investigators to develop that knowledge.</description><learn_about>How the forces of evolution shape patterns of biological variation

You’re acquainted with your DNA, but did you know that your cells synthesize enough DNA during your lifetime to stretch a lightyear in length? How does the cellular machinery accomplish such a feat without making more mistakes than you can survive? Why isn’t the incidence of cancer even higher than it is? And, if the DNA in each and every cell is two meters long, how is this genetic material compacted to fit inside the cell nucleus without becoming a tangled mess?
 
Are you ready to go beyond the “what" of scientific information presented in textbooks and explore  scientists deduce the details of these molecular models?
 
Take a behind-the-scenes look at modern molecular genetics, from the classic experimental events that identified the proteins involved in DNA replication and repair to cutting-edge assays that apply the power of genome sequencing. Do you feel confident in your ability to design molecular biology experiments and interpret data from them? We've designed the problems in this course to build your experimental design and data analysis skills.
 
Let’s explore the limits of our current knowledge about the replication machinery and pathways that protect the fidelity of DNA synthesis. If you are up for the challenge, join us in 7.28x Part 1: DNA Replication and Repair.

This course will explore Bram Stoker’s 1897 classic vampire novel, Dracula, which is famous for introducing the vampire Count Dracula. This is the story of Dracula's move from Transylvania to England to find new blood and spread the curse of the undead. It also introduces the now-famous character of Professor Abraham Van Helsing.

The novel is categorized in many different ways: vampire, horror, and gothic fiction. It also addresses concepts such as women in Victorian culture, colonialism, sexuality, and post-colonialism. Although Stoker was not the first writer to tell the story of a vampire, he is credited for giving the vampire its modern form. This story has been adapted to many different forms in film and theater.

Participants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion. Course materials will include background information for understanding the text, as well as vocabulary and language support. Assessment will include quizzes and short writing assignments.</description><learn_about>Read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence

Language is an integral part of society. Wherever we come from, the words we use and the way in which we use them are fundamental to our cultural identity. In today’s increasingly globalised world, however, ‘linguicide’ – the loss of a language – is becoming all too common. But there is hope. The language revival movement has emerged as an important and effective response, and this course will introduce you to its key principles and techniques.
 
After discussing powerful answers to the question of  languages should be revived, we’ll investigate . Far more than just a simple process of recovering literacy and lost letters, language revival involves a deep and complex engagement with history, human rights, identity and wellbeing. You will also learn what’s being done around the world right now, and how effective these techniques have been.</description><learn_about>Explore connections between language and identity.

Múltiples y diversas manifestaciones muestran que se están produciendo unos profundos cambios en el mundo. El modelo de la sociedad industrial está dejando paso a un nuevo modelo de sociedad, aún difuso, en el que la capacidad de transformar la información en conocimiento es clave. Es fácil deducir que para esta nueva sociedad emergente se necesita un concepto de educación bien distinto al que requería la sociedad industrial.

La complejidad de los problemas emanados de una rápida globalización de la economía así como  los grandes avances en la tecnología de la información (TI) han acelerado la aparición de sucesivas crisis económicas y sociales en las que tanto gobiernos de muchos países como empresas encuentran dificultades para adaptarse a esta nueva situación  y cambiar con agilidad sus modelos de  gobierno y gestión.

Por otro lado la agresión al medio ambiente y el cambio climático  y  la necesidad de atender los requerimientos  de agentes económicos y sociales reclaman su derecho a desempeñar el rol que les corresponde. Emergen tendencias como la Responsabilidad Social Corporativa, vinculada a procesos de reporte estandarizado, como el que marca Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) y a mejoras en los esquemas de Gobernanza Corporativa, necesarias para armonizar los distintos ecosistemas tanto sociales como empresariales y ambientales garantizando la legítima participación de todas las partes interesadas y equiparando la información generada a la financiera a la hora de tomar decisiones.

En este escenario, los activos utilizados tanto por gobiernos como empresas para desarrollar deben ser administrados de manera eficaz y eficiente para incrementar el valor de las organizaciones de manera incremental y continua garantizando principalmente  la sostenibilidad económico financiera de esas organizaciones. Dentro de esos activos, la información y la TI adquieren valor importantísimo para facilitar  las necesidades de transformación de las organizaciones y, especialmente gobernar y gestionar el uso adecuado de la TI tal como señala la norma ISO/IECE 38500.

En cualquier caso, la implantación de éstas  tecnologías requiere un cambio profundo en la cultura de las organizaciones, públicas y privadas y la adopción de principios y políticas internas que impidan posibles perjuicios a todas las partes interesadas en el éxito de dichas organizaciones.

La aplicación de las distintas normas mencionadas así como  renovación del concepto de Gobernanza Corporativa aplicada a los distintos activos y especialmente a la TI (dirección y control en el uso y gestión de los mismos) es uno de los grandes retos a los que se enfrenta hoy el mundo económico financiero así como la generación de conocimiento e inteligencia para resolver los graves problemas de nuestros días y en el futuro. Esta nueva forma de trabajar hará que las empresas sean más responsables, comprometidas, humanas,  productivas, y más eficaces y eficientes en el liderazgo, formación y aptitud personal así como un uso adecuado de la TI por parte de la organización.</description><learn_about>no info</learn_about><url>https://www.edx.org/course/responsabilidad-social-corporativa-y-su-oecx-b1156-x</url></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>course-v1:BUx+SABR101x+2T2015</course_id><title>Sabermetrics 101: Introduction to Baseball Analytics</title><published_date>2015-02-18T23:21:14-05:00</published_date><course_intro>An introduction to sabermetrics, baseball analytics, data science, the R Language, and SQL. </course_intro><subject>Subject: Data Analysis &amp; Statistics</subject><level>Level: Introductory</level><school>Institution: BUx</school><description>This is an Archived Course

This course will provide fundamental knowledge in immunology as well as some advanced topics from cutting-edge research results, such as cancer immunotherapy and novel vaccine development.
 
Immunity is the body’s system of protection from attack by pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. Immunology has a long history, and researchers around the world faced with the “enemies of human life” have solved numerous immunological mysteries, and contributed to a paradigm shift in immunology. Nonetheless, it is as yet unknown how certain diseases like AIDS, influenza and allergies can be completely conquered. The latest immunological research is revealing that immunity is also strongly correlated with an increasing number of other diseases such as cancer, arteriosclerosis and diabetes. If we could fully understand the mechanism of immunity, we should be able to treat such diseases. We would like to introduce basic knowledge of immunology revealed by past research and share our insights on the latest findings with you for the future development of immunology.
 
During this course you will learn the mechanisms of the immune system and deepen your understanding of forefront immunology research and development of medical applications.  We especially encourage young people who are interested in life-science and immunology to join this course, as it will assist consideration of immunology research as a career.
 
The part one of the course consists of 5 lectures of about 90 minutes each.
The first week covers introductory subjects and specific topics follow from the second week.
 

Week 1. Introduction: Overview of immunology
Week 2. Innate immunity
Week 3. Acquired immunity 1

Far too frequently, the people who have the most to say have the hardest time saying it. Many of the best minds in our society, our most talented employees and our most promising students, fail to have the impact they could because of ineffective strategies for communicating their ideas and insights to others.</description><learn_about>Review communications skills
Though many students learn communications skills early in their academic career, they may have not practiced, or may have forgotten, many useful communications tactics. Additionally, by the time these students begin to develop expertise in specific disciplines and begin working in certain industries, the communication needs become specialized and more challenging.
Help experts assess the value of communication and gain confidence in their abilities
Some people don't want to communicate. They don't feel it is their job. They want to focus on their own technical areas of expertise. Perhaps they fear it a little because it is not their "area" or they simply dismiss it as unimportant. Either way, such beliefs ultimately become constraints on their own success and run counter to the expectations of others who oversee their work.
Help professionals bridge the communication gap
Many people often underestimate how hard it is to effectively communicate and think they do a better job than they actually do. After all, their content makes sense to them, and if someone else doesn't understand, it must be their fault.</learn_about><url>https://www.edx.org/course/communicating-strategically-purduex-pn-15-2</url></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>course-v1:ASUx+MCO425x+2T2015</course_id><title>Media LIT: Overcoming Information Overload</title><published_date>2015-04-24T10:14:42-04:00</published_date><course_intro>Take control of information overload and make media serve you better.</course_intro><subject>Subject: Communication</subject><level>Level: Introductory</level><school>Institution: ASUx</school><description>This is an Archived Course

Media literacy helps us understand, analyze and create media. While we rely on good journalism to provide accurate information, we also have responsibilities of our own in this media-saturated environment. We can no longer be passive consumers of media.

This course will examine James Joyce’s collection of fifteen short stories called simply Dubliners. This volume was first published in 1914, but not without a struggle. Joyce first submitted these stories to a publisher in 1905, and had it rejected 17 times before it was finally published in 1914. It has become one of the classics of English language literature, despite its rocky beginnings.

 depicts middle class Irish life in the early part of the 20th century. The first stories are narrated by protagonists who are children. As the stories continue, they examine the lives of characters in increasingly older stages of life. Interestingly, many of the characters who appear in these short stories appear later in minor roles in Joyce’s famous novel .
 
Participants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion. Course materials will include background information for understanding the text, as well as vocabulary and language support. Assessment will include quizzes and short writing assignments.

Principles of Biochemistry integrates an introduction to the structure of macromolecules and a biochemical approach to cellular function. Topics addressing protein function will include enzyme kinetics, the characterization of major metabolic pathways and their interconnection into tightly regulated networks, and the manipulation of enzymes and pathways with mutations or drugs. An exploration of simple cells (red blood cells) to more complex tissues (muscle and liver) will be used as a framework to discuss the progression in metabolic complexity. Learners will also develop problem solving and analytical skills that are more generally applicable to the life sciences.

Everyone experiences adversity and stress at some level, whether it’s the pressure to perform in school or work, relationship problems, financial difficulties, or simply the number of tasks to do in a short period of time. All stress isn’t bad, but chronic stress can take its toll on our minds, bodies, and behavior. Research has shown that people can learn and use specific resilience skills (such as optimistic thinking, relaxation strategies, choosing one’s attention) and positive routines (good sleep, scheduling in fun, and so on) in order to better manage stress, bounce back quicker after a setback, be more effective in their academic and vocational pursuits, develop stronger relationships with others, be physically and mentally healthy, and be satisfied with their lives overall. In short, resilience is ordinary magic and can be learned. It does not necessarily mean that you have to be born resilient or get lucky in life.</description><learn_about>no info</learn_about><url>https://www.edx.org/course/becoming-resilient-person-science-stress-uwashingtonx-ecfs311x-0</url></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>course-v1:Microsoft+DEV202.1x+2015_T4</course_id><title>Building Cloud Apps with Microsoft Azure – Part 1</title><published_date>2015-05-14T10:27:42-04:00</published_date><course_intro>Learn to build real-world cloud solutions from Microsoft experts.</course_intro><subject>Subject: Computer Science</subject><level>Level: Intermediate</level><school>Institution: Microsoft</school><description>This is an Archived Course

Bootstrap is an open source project originally created by Twitter to enable creation of responsive, mobile first web pages. Bootstrap has a standard set of classes that allow developers to quickly create applications that scale to devices of all sizes, and incorporate common components such as dialog boxes and validation. Bootstrap has become a de facto standard for web design.
 
This course is designed to be a primer on Bootstrap. By the end of the three modules you will have gained the knowledge to create pages common to all web applications, and implement the most frequently used components and classes provided by Bootstrap. You will also see how to use the tooling provided by Visual Studio to assist you in creating pages as quickly as possible.</description><learn_about>How to implement Bootstrap in existing web sites

The Bible says that Jesus was identified as God's beloved son at his baptism. The same identification was made about Israel in the Old Testament and the disciples of Christ at their baptism. The striking similarity of these titles establishes a tight interrelationship between the people Israel, the person of Jesus Christ, and the church.
 
In this course, we will explore how a close reading of the book of Genesis, the Gospels, and early Christian writers can shed further light on these relationships and, in so doing, deepen our understanding of the figure of Jesus Christ.  Unlike many other treatments, this course does not presume that Jesus’ character can be plumbed solely by an examination of the Gospel stories. The witness of the Jewish scriptures and the lives of the saints are also important sources for this task.
 
The course will be eight weeks in length and organized around three topical questions:
Who is Israel? (primary source material: the book of Genesis)
Who is Jesus? (primary source material: the Gospels and the Creeds)
Who is the Church? (primary source material: a selection of post-Biblical Christian writers)
 
No matter what your background in the study of theology, this course will provide a fresh approach to the identify of Jesus Christ that will reveal how the church has explored the unmeasurable depths of his person.</description><learn_about>Recognize major people, places, and events of the Old and New Testament as related to the narratives of Israel and Jesus

The goal of this course is to provide high school students and college freshman a broad outline of engineering and help them decide on a career in engineering. The first part of this course is focused on exploring the different disciplines of engineering and providing participants with a broad background in different areas of engineering.
 
Do you want to learn how race-cars are built? How robots are able to work independently? How unmanned vehicles are designed and built? How is energy harvested? How is energy stored? How are organs built? How is the body imaged? How do you design an aircraft? How do electrons travel in micro and nanoelectronics? How are drugs delivered in the body? How do you build on soils that are unstable? How do robots see? How is light used in devices? How is data stored and managed? How is pollution mitigated? How are electrical signals processed? How are strong and tough materials designed and built? How is thermal energy managed? How is data transmitted? How are systems integrated? How do you make sure goods and services reach their destination? How do you start a company? What are the underlying ethical and social responsibilities of being a professional engineer? These are all things that engineers are dealing with on a daily basis and will form the basis of the first part of the course.
 

 
Mathematics is an integral part of engineering and Engineering Mathematics is the process of applying the principles of mathematics to solve real life engineering problems.  A reference textbook will be used for this part of the course and is entitled
 
Topics to be covered in mathematics will include: application of algebra in engineering in linear and quadratic equations, trigonometry in motion of robots, application of complex numbers in electrical circuits, use of systems of equations to solve problems in statics, dynamics and DC circuits. Concepts of derivatives will be introduced and its application in engineering problems such as dynamics, electrical circuits and mechanics will be explored. In a similar fashion concepts of integrals will be examined in the context of engineering applications such as statics, dynamics and electrical circuits. The intent of this course is not to establish mastery of mathematics but rather develop an understanding of the role played by mathematics to help solve engineering problems. Participants in this course will have a better understanding of calculus and differential equations and their relevance in solving engineering problems as they progress in their engineering education.</description><learn_about>Learn the role of Engineering in the development of technology

In recent years, flying robots such as miniature helicopters or quadrotors have received a large gain in popularity. Potential applications range from aerial filming over remote visual inspection of industrial sites to automatic 3D reconstruction of buildings. Navigating a quadrotor manually requires a skilled pilot and constant concentration. Therefore, there is a strong scientific interest to develop solutions that enable quadrotors to fly autonomously and without constant human supervision. This is a challenging research problem because the payload of a quadrotor is uttermost constrained and so both the quality of the onboard sensors and the available computing power is strongly limited. </description><learn_about>Understand the flight principles of quadrotors and their application potential

Problems with healthcare quality, access, and costs bedevil all countries. This course explores how to create successful global business innovations in health care that can better meet consumer and social needs. Upon conclusion, you will learn to evaluate opportunities and gain an understanding of the elements necessary for viable healthcare business models.
 
Innovating in Health Care (IHC) enables participants to meet and interact with others who are also interested in improving health care. Through case study analysis and application of the “Innovating in Health Care Framework”, this course focuses on evaluating and crafting healthcare startup business models that focus on the six factors that critically shape new healthcare ventures: Financing, Structure, Public Policy, Consumers, Technology, and Accountability. Innovating in Health Care discusses the impact of these factors on business models for three different kinds of innovations: Consumer-focused, technology-driven, and integrations which create scale.

In this introductory course, you’ll learn the engineering principles that can be applied to structural systems everywhere: in nature, in furniture, in mechanical and aerospace systems, and in any solid object  that resists a load.
 
Together we’ll explore how structures work, why they were designed the way they were designed, how they support loads, and where forces flow through them.
 
You’ll learn through a series of hands-on, inquiry-based activities with easily accessible materials, as well as with online simulation tools. We’ll provide lots of guidance for each activity but also encourage you to be creative and experiment so that you may discover the forms and designs that work best.  
 
More specifically we’ll:</description><learn_about>How and why the world's structures (including structures in the natural and biological world) were designed and constructed the way they were

Homer’s account of the Trojan War in the Iliad explores the effects of warfare upon Greeks and Trojans alike. It illustrates not only the challenges that the combatants faced, but also the plight of innocent victims– women, children, and the elderly. Though the is often regarded as a kind of Greek national epic, Homer is remarkably even-handed in his treatment of the two sides, even seeming to favor the Trojans over the Greeks at times. He repeatedly emphasizes the horrors of war and his varied descriptions of deaths on the battlefield are unparalleled in both intensity and, paradoxically, poetic charm. The primary objective of warfare in the imaginary time period depicted by Homer is to attain personal glory through acts of individual prowess, with the good of the community seen as a secondary goal.
 
This course explores the idea that war is both universal and particular. The Vietnam War was not the same as the Iraq War. In every war, some things are the same, while some are different. Intense suffering and horrific acts are inevitable. However, the mode of fighting, the resources, the arms, the equipment, the treatment of prisoners, the command structure, and the ideology driving men and women to fight all differ.</description><learn_about>The causes and contentions of the Trojan War through the eyes of Homer

The concept of a Smart City holds much promise for improving the quality of life for city dwellers, but what exactly do we mean by “Smart City?” It means aligning information technologies to citizens’ needs in order to enhance their day-to-day lives by increasing efficiency, lowering costs, and engaging more directly with city dwellers. Smart City has emerged as an interdisciplinary concept that covers different aspects related to big cities, including the infrastructure that enables communication between channels and entities for overcoming economic backwardness in a community, and for addressing differences between various urban and suburban zones. A dynamic model is observed that can be analyzed as a complex system. Since a city can´t be visualized in only one perspective, this course tackles some of its individual sectors to obtain the key performance indicators that are essential to improving the quality of life, including: urbanization, communication, education, and economy. Quantifying that data is useful for estimating consumed resources, forecasting shortages, and correcting damage in a timely manner.

Once participants understand the importance of a Smart City and its classifications, they will learn to identify the impact of using metrics to measure its performance. A very important skill to develop is how to classify a metric and to identify its units or measure. The main focus of this course is to develop participants’ basic knowledge of a Smart City by being able to identify the parameters involved in its creation. Participants will also be able to define and establish the necessary metrics to measure the performance of a Smart City.</description><learn_about>The definition and key elements of a Smart City

WHAT IS “HOW STUFF MOVES”?
Mechanics is the study of how things move. It was the first quantitative science to achieve wide power to predict behavior, including things never before directly observed. Newton, Leibniz, and others invented calculus to describe motion and we will find both differential and integral calculus extremely useful throughout this course.</description><learn_about>The basic physics of how objects move

When you meet a new person, it is hard to know what to expect.  You may not be able to read the person or understand what they mean. Even if you want to have a good relationship with them, this lack of understanding can make interactions tense, unpredictable and scary! The same is true for a lot of people as they encounter statistics and mathematical ways of working with data.  Statistics can be confusing and opaque.  Symbols, Greek letters, very large and very small numbers, and how to interpret all of this can leave to feeling cold and disengaged—even fearful and resentful.</description><learn_about>Select appropriate statistical tests for data according to the levels of measurement

The modern smartphone is enabled by a billion-plus nanotransistors, each having an active region that is barely a few hundred atoms long. Interestingly the same amazing technology has also led to a deeper understanding of the nature of current flow on an atomic scale and my aim is to make these lessons from nanoelectronics accessible to anyone in any branch of science or engineering. I will assume very little background beyond linear algebra and differential equations, although we will be discussing advanced concepts in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics that should be of interest even to specialists.
 
In the first half of this course (4 weeks) we will introduce a new perspective connecting the quantized conductance of short ballistic conductors to the familiar Ohm's law of long diffusive conductors, along with a brief description of the modern nanotransistor. In the second half (4 weeks) we will address fundamental conceptual issues related to the meaning of resistance on an atomic scale, the interconversion of electricity and heat, the second law of thermodynamics and the fuel value of information.
 
Overall I hope to show that the lessons of nanoelectronics lead naturally to a new viewpoint, one that changes even some basic concepts we all learn in freshman physics. This unique viewpoint not only clarifies many old questions but also provides a powerful approach to new questions at the frontier of modern nanoelectronics, such as how devices can be built to control the spin of electrons.
 
This course was originally offered in 2012 on nanoHUB-U and the accompanying text was subsequently published by World Scientific. I am preparing a second edition for publication in 2015, which will be used for this course. The manuscript will be made available to registered students.

Perhaps no story is as essential to get right as the history of capitalism. Nearly all of our theories about promoting progress come from how we interpret the economic changes of the last 500 years. This past decade’s crises continue to remind us just how much capitalism changes, even as its basic features—wage labor, financial markets, private property, entrepreneurs—endure. While capitalism has a global history, the United States plays a special role in that story. This course will help you to understand how the United States became the world’s leading economic power, revealing essential lessons about what has been and what will be possible in capitalism’s on-going revolution.</description><learn_about>Describe the development of American capitalism as a historical process that emerged from political choices, business cultures, entrepreneurial decisions, and technological transformations.

This course, the fourth installment of the multi-part Poetry in America series, explores the poetry of Emily Dickinson, one of America’s most distinctive and prolific poets. While Dickinson wrote nearly 2,000 poems during her lifetime, she chose never to publish, opting instead to revisit and revise her works throughout her lifetime.  Keeping this dynamic of self-revision in mind, we will consider a number of Dickinson’s poems—many seemingly in tension with one another—concerned with Nature, Art, the Self, and Darkness. We will travel to the Dickinson Collection at Harvard's Houghton Library, and to Amherst, Massachusetts, paying a visit to the house in which the poet lived and wrote until her death in 1886. Distinguished guests for this module include NBA athlete Jason Collins, dancers Damian Woetzel and Charles “Lil Buck” Riley, and President and CEO of the New America Foundation Anne Marie Slaughter, among others.
 
Led by Harvard Professor Elisa New, surveys nearly 400 years of American poetry. Through video lectures, archival images and texts, expeditions to historic sites, interpretive seminars with large and small groups, interviews with poets and scholars, and conversations about poems with distinguished Americans, Poetry in America embarks on a journey through the literature of a nation. Distinguished guests, including President Bill Clinton, Elena Kagan, Henry Louis Gates, Eve Ensler, John McCain, Andrea Mitchell, Michael Pollan, Drew Faust, Tony Kushner, and Nas, among others, bring fresh perspectives to the study of American Poetry.</description><learn_about>How to understand the work of Emily Dickinson -- as it is shaped by 19th-century New England culture and as her innovations transcend that culture

This course looks inside U.S. prisons, through the history of literary witness produced by incarcerated people. This history will help us to understand the mass-scale prison’s rise, its day-to-day practices, and why it fails so badly at the task of rehabilitation. Through prison witness, we may hope to begin to understand what is needed to make the U.S. prison a more socially constructive institution. Among other texts, we will read and discuss Fourth City: Essays from the Prison in America, The (online) American Prison Writing Archive, hosted and made possible by Hamilton College's Digital Humanities Initiative, and come to a sense of the moral weight that prison witness must carry in any truly democratic debate on the criminal justice system.</description><learn_about>How first-person testimonial by incarcerated people can help us understand the American prison system

东南亚在中国之南，且濒临海洋，所以古代把它称为“南海”或“南洋”。“东南亚”这个名称，是第二次世界大战期间才出现的。东南亚地区很早就有人类 活动，并在公元前后形成了原始的文化形态，主要表现在东南亚的岩画、巨石、瓮葬和铜鼓等特色鲜明文化遗迹。从公元3世纪开始，印度文化、中国文化、伊斯兰 文化和西方文化陆续进入东南亚地区，经历了长期的本土化过程，与东南亚的本土文化进行了充分的融合，形成了独特的文化形态和文化特点。

1967 年，印度尼西亚、泰国、新加坡、菲律宾四国外长和马来西亚副总理在曼谷举行会议，发表了《曼谷宣言》（《东南亚国家联盟成立宣言》），正式宣告东南亚国家 联盟（简称“东盟”）成立。20世纪80年代后，文莱（1984年）、越南（1995年）、老挝（1997年）、缅甸（1997年）和柬埔寨（1999 年）5国先后加入东盟，使这一组织涵盖整个东南亚地区。

由于中国与东南亚在地理位置上的相邻关系，奠定了东南亚地区在中国对外关系中的 “首要”地位。随着中国与东南亚交流层次的逐步深入，中国扩大了国际影响力，积累了丰富的开展国际交流的经验。但是，由于中国民众对于东南亚文化的了解程 度还有提升的空间，从而也在中国与东南亚的交流中造成了一定的问题。本课程将将系统梳理东南亚文化发展进程的基础上，以兼顾东南亚传统文化与现代文化的特 点，以具体的文化现象为中心，为同学们呈现东南亚文化的多样性与独特性。
 
"Southeast Asia" is the term which appeared during World War II. In Chinese history documents, this region was called “Nan Yang” or “Nan Hai”. From the beginning of the 3rd century AD, Indian culture, Chinese culture, Islamic culture and Western culture have moved into this area. After a long process of localization, external culture and the native culture were fully fused, forming a unique cultural expression and cultural characteristics.

In 1967, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines and Malaysia issued "Bangkok Declaration" to declare the establishment of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was established. After the 1980s, Brunei (1984), Vietnam (1995), Laos (1997), Myanmar (1997) and Cambodia (1999) has joined the ASEAN, so that this organization covering the entire Southeast Asian region.

As the geographical neighbor of China, the Southeast Asian region plays "top" role in China's foreign relations. With the gradual deepening of exchanges between China and Southeast Asia, misunderstanding of cultures caused some problems. In order to improve the understanding of Chinese people about the neighbor countries, this course will show the development steps of Southeast Asian culture, and explain the traditional and modern culture features of Southeast Asia through the specific cultural phenomenons.</description><learn_about>中国、印度、阿拉伯与西方各种文化类型在该地区的传播和影响

Playing drums, telling stories, touching stones, creating wildly colorful altars, dancing, eating and drinking special substances are all basic religious activities. Examples will range across Native American, Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim, Christian, and Jewish rituals and symbols, and materials will traverse fields from art history to anthropology, philosophy to poetry, science to religious studies. We will toggle between broad theories of religions and specific case studies.

An introductory week will be followed by a week on each of the five senses, and a concluding week. Each week we will incorporate lectures, readings, podcasts, images, and videos, and students will be challenged to spend a little time "offline" and taking notice of the sensual-spiritual elements that make up our cultural life.</description><learn_about>Find ways to critically reflect on religious environments

From simulating complex phenomenon on supercomputers to storing the coordinates needed in modern 3D printing, data is a huge and growing part of our world. A major tool to manipulate and study this data is linear algebra. This course is part 1 of a 2-part course.  In this part, we’ll learn basics of matrix algebra with an emphasis on application.  This class has a focus on computer graphics while also containing examples in data mining. We’ll learn to make an image transparent, fade from one image to another, and rotate a 3D wireframe model.  We’ll also mine data; for example, we will find similar movies that one might enjoy seeing. In the topic of sports ranking, we’ll be ready to participate in March Madness and submit our own mathematically generated brackets to compete against millions of others.  The lectures are developed to encourage you to explore and create your own ideas either through your own programming but also with online tools developed for the course.

Las estructuras están implicadas en nuestras vidas: las plantas, los animales, casi todo lo que fabrica el ser humano, incluso nuestro propio cuerpo, deben soportar una serie de fuerzas sin romperse, y por lo tanto prácticamente cualquier elemento de nuestro entorno es una estructura de una clase u otra. No cabe duda de que entender cómo se comportan las estructuras es fundamental para entender el mundo que nos rodea, para comprender la naturaleza y para juzgar mejor los progresos que ha hecho la humanidad a lo largo de la historia.

How can we strengthen libraries and librarians in the advancement of knowledge, creativity, and literacy in the 21st century? Though libraries have been loved for over 3,600 years, their relevance in the digital age is being questioned, and their economic and social impacts are poorly understood. What is really essential about libraries and librarians, today and tomorrow? How can library members and all who support the mission of 21st-century librarianship raise the profile and support of these timeless values and services, and ensure universal access to the universe of ideas in all our communities? This course is based on what works. We’ll take an inspired, strategic, evidence-based approach to advocacy for the future of strong communities – cities, villages, universities and colleges, research and development centres, businesses, and not-for-profits.

We will cover:</description><learn_about>Acquire insights on your own motivations, reflect on the principles of librarianship, and identify what’s at stake for libraries
Employ key research relevant to advocacy for libraries: evidence on perceptions of libraries; values and assumptions of decision makers; and the dynamics of influence
Consider and apply ways to exert influence and engage others
Adopt a strategic perspective in planning for your advocacy
Communicate more effectively, and develop and strengthen strategic relationships
Plan and apply best practice to move an advocacy objective forward

Innovation and Commercialization is taught by distinguished practicing innovators. They debunk the concept of innovation as a linear process, from research to development to product in the market. They present a simple model for understanding it as a highly iterative process, in which you cycle repeatedly through many factors in the areas of Technology, Market and Implementation -- until the right pieces come together. Prof. Fitzgerald tells the story of his own major innovation, tracing it along the winding path into products we use every day.

This interdisciplinary course explores the complex interactions between poverty, rural livelihoods, and forest resources in developing countries.  We will consider some of the dynamics that occur when impoverished people use forests in their daily lives. We will talk about the role of forests for medicines and wild foods, as sources of fuelwood and charcoal for energy, and other pressing topics that confront sustainable forest management such as the impacts of human health and diseases on forests. The course consists of modules on forests and livelihoods in developing countries, agroforestry, human health in forested environments, protected areas and their sustainability, small and medium forest enterprises (SMFEs), and  community forestry. Three cross-cutting themes (gender, tenure and forest rights, and climate change) will span all of the modules.

This course will engage you in developing a deeper understanding of the fundamental importance of forest resources in the lives and livelihoods of people in developing countries. Participants from tropical and developing countries may have lived much of what we will talk about in this course, and your experiences will deepen our understanding of the course material. Participants not from a developing country will gain a much better appreciation for the multitude of ways that people in developing countries use forest resources. Weekly videos will be complemented by readings, quizzes, and links to online resources to help you explore current scholarship in this domain. A discussion forum will enable you to delve more deeply into these issues with other participants and the course staff. The themes covered in this MOOC are important to anyone working in international forestry.</description><learn_about>no info</learn_about><url>https://www.edx.org/course/forests-livelihoods-developing-countries-ubcx-forest222x</url></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>IEEEx/ISSCCx/3T2014</course_id><title>ISSCC Previews: Circuit and System Insights</title><published_date>2014-11-07T14:02:08-05:00</published_date><course_intro>ISSCC Previews: Circuit and System Insights, covering several fields, including wireless and wireline communication, analog, digital, and memory.</course_intro><subject>Subject: Electronics</subject><level>Level: Introductory</level><school>Institution: IEEEx</school><description>This is an Archived Course

Vision may feel effortless: you open your eyes, and the world appears. But the process of focusing light into image on the back of the eye and translating it into meaningful nerve signals is incredibly complex. The retina and visual cortex are packed with intricate processing circuitry, and have been a mystery to neuroscientists for centuries. Now, answers are beginning to emerge.
 
Today, the visual system is often called the model system for neuroscience: its findings are relevant to all other areas and to investigating the deeper mysteries of the brain’s microstructure and function. In this course, we take you from the physics of focusing light onto the retina, to the processing of colors, form, and motion, and finally to the interpretation of visual information in the cortex. We distill the mysteries of the visual system by posing questions and investigating them in a series of thematic, animated videos. This journey through the eye, retina and brain will (quite literally) change how you see the world.</description><learn_about>no info</learn_about><url>https://www.edx.org/course/light-spike-sight-neuroscience-vision-mitx-9-01-1x</url></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>SNUx/SNU216B.226.1x/1T2014</course_id><title>International Politics in the Korean Peninsula, Part 1</title><published_date>2014-02-04T11:45:50-05:00</published_date><course_intro>An introduction to archetypes of politics and contemporary issues of the inter-Korean relationship.</course_intro><subject>Subject: History</subject><level>Level: Introductory</level><school>Institution: SNUx</school><description>This is an Archived Course

This class engages students in a transdisciplinary conversation about representations of HIV/AIDS: in science writing, journalism, visual art, literature, drama, and popular culture. We believe that scientists and cultural critics can learn valuable lessons from one another, even as they create their own responses to HIV/AIDS. Today, over 30 years since the first scientific reports of HIV/AIDS, the pandemic remains a major health concern throughout the world. But, rays of hope have led to speculation that an AIDS-free generation may be possible. In such a timely moment, it is essential for us to connect across the "two cultures" as we consider the social and scientific implications of HIV/AIDS.</description><learn_about>The basics of how to do literary analysis and how to read a scientific article

Shakespeare wrote for a popular audience and was immensely successful. Shakespeare is also rightly regarded as one of the greatest playwrights the world has known. This course will try to understand both Shakespeare’s popularity and his greatness by starting from a simple premise: that the fullest appreciation of Shakespeare can be achieved only when literary study is combined with analysis of the plays as theatre. Hence, as we delve into the dimensions that make Shakespeare’s plays so extraordinary--from the astonishing power of their language to their uncanny capacity to illuminate so much of human life--we will also explore them in performance from Shakespeare’s own theatre to the modern screen. At the same time, actors will occasionally join our effort and demonstrate ways of bringing the text alive as living theatre. Plays to be studied will include , and .</description><learn_about>no info</learn_about><url>https://www.edx.org/course/shakespeare-page-performance-wellesleyx-eng112x</url></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>HarvardX/AT1x/2T2014</course_id><title>AnatomyX: Musculoskeletal Cases</title><published_date>2014-04-15T13:44:29-04:00</published_date><course_intro>Learn the anatomy basic to understanding common musculoskeletal injuries.

This course has two goals. The first is to introduce you to the things that philosophers think about. We will look at some perennial philosophical problems: Is there a God? What is knowledge, and how do we get it? What is the place of our consciousness in the physical world? Do we have free will? How do we persist over time, as our bodily and psychological traits change? The second goal is to get you thinking philosophically yourself. This will help you develop your critical reasoning and argumentative skills more generally. Along the way we will draw from late, great classical authors and influential contemporary figures.</description><learn_about>How to construct and analyze philosophical arguments

Sociology offers us a powerful set of tools with which to interpret our relationship to a global social and cultural economy. This course extends conventional sociology to foster an understanding of how the conditions of our everyday lives fit in with broader trends of continuity and change in regions across the world. We use the global garment industry as a vehicle for mobilizing our sociological imaginations, and follow the movements of capital, materials, and labor in the garment industry to examine the economic and cultural exchanges that keep our complex world in motion. Along the way, we’ll learn to critically read social scientific texts and construct evidence-based arguments.</description><learn_about>Understand the sociological imagination and how to connect your biography to global histories

The last century ushered in significant progress. Philosophers, scientists, artists, and poets overthrew our understanding of the physical world, of human behavior, of thought and its limits, and of art, creativity, and beauty. Scientific progress improved the way we lived across the world. Yet the last century also brought increased levels of war, tyranny, and genocide. Man pushed boundaries of good and evil, right and wrong, justice and injustice – and people lost faith in values. Now, thinkers and leaders are reconstructing theories of value and creating institutions to embody them. Join this thought-provoking, broad-sweeping course as it draws intriguing connections between philosophy, art, literature, and history, illuminating our world and our place in it.

7.00x is an introductory level biology course hosted by professor Eric Lander, who was one of the leaders of the Human Genome Project. The course content reflects the topics taught in the MIT introductory biology courses and many biology courses across the world. As a student, you will first focus on the structure and function of macromolecules such as DNA, RNA and proteins. You will discover how changes in the structure of some of these macromolecules alter their functions and what the implications of such changes have on human health. As you continue in the course, you will apply an understanding of heredity and information flow within cells to human health and disease and will learn about molecular biological techniques and their potential to impact our changing world. After you complete this course, you will have a foundation in biology that will allow you to understand the remarkable medical revolution going on today.</description><learn_about>no info</learn_about><url>https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-biology-secret-life-mitx-7-00x-2</url></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>SNUx/SNU446.345.2x/2T2014</course_id><title>Robot Mechanics and Control, Part II</title><published_date>2014-04-01T18:04:46-04:00</published_date><course_intro>A mathematical introduction to the mechanics and control of robots.</course_intro><subject>Subject: Computer Science</subject><level>Level: Advanced</level><school>Institution: SNUx</school><description>This is an Archived Course

This course is Part II of a two-part mathematical introduction to the mechanics and control of robots that can be modeled as kinematic chains. Topics covered include the concept of a robot’s configuration space and degrees of freedom, static grasp analysis, the description of rigid body motions, kinematics of open and closed chains, and the basics of robot control. The emphasis is not on the latest research trends and technological innovations in robotics, but on learning the fundamental concepts and core principles that underlie robotics as a scientific discipline. The intent is to help students acquire a unified set of analytical tools for the modeling and control of robots, together with a reliable physical intuition that recognizes the unique and interdisciplinary nature of robotics—in short, content that will serve as a reliable foundation for whatever trends may appear later, and remain relevant to both the practitioner and researcher. NOTE: Part II will cover screw motions and the product of exponentials kinematics formula, inverse kinematics of open chains, velocity kinematics and statics, closed chain kinematics, and basics of robot control.</description><learn_about>The basics of robot control

Statistics 2 at Berkeley is an introductory class taken by about 1,000 students each year. Stat2.3x is the last in a sequence of three courses that make up Stat2x, the online equivalent of Berkeley's Stat 2. The focus of Stat2.3x is on statistical inference: how to make valid conclusions based on data from random samples. At the heart of the main problem addressed by the course will be a population (which you can imagine for now as a set of people) connected with which there is a numerical quantity of interest (which you can imagine for now as the average number of MOOCs the people have taken). If you could talk to each member of the population, you could calculate that number exactly. But what if the population is so large that your resources will not stretch to interviewing every member? What if you can only reach a subset of the population?</description><learn_about>no info</learn_about><url>https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-statistics-inference-uc-berkeleyx-stat2-3x</url></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>MITx/8.MReVx/2T2014</course_id><title>Mechanics ReView</title><published_date>2014-04-16T16:16:54-04:00</published_date><course_intro>Mechanics ReView is an MIT-level introductory mechanics class emphasizing a strategic problem-solving approach.  It covers the same syllabus topics as the Advanced Placement Mechanics-C course.</course_intro><subject>Subject: Engineering</subject><level>Level: Introductory</level><school>Institution: MITx</school><description>This is an Archived Course

This is an introductory astronomy survey class that covers our understanding of the physical universe and its major constituents, including planetary systems, stars, galaxies, black holes, quasars, larger structures, and the universe as a whole. We will learn how modern astronomical observations and applications of physics we know from the planet Earth reveal the nature of these objects and explain their observed properties, and tell us how they form and evolve. We will also examine various cosmic phenomena, from variable or exploding stars to the expansion of the universe and the evidence for dark matter, dark energy, and the big bang. The universe as a whole and all of its major constituents are evolving, and we now have a fairly complete and consistent picture of these processes that is based on the objective evidence from observations and the laws of physics.

Too much mathematical rigor teaches rigor mortis: the fear of making an unjustified leap even when it lands on a correct result. Instead of paralysis, have courage: Shoot first and ask questions later. Although unwise as public policy, it is a valuable problem-solving philosophy and the theme of this course: how to guess answers without a proof or an exact calculation, in order to develop insight.</description><learn_about>no info</learn_about><url>https://www.edx.org/course/street-fighting-math-mitx-6-sfmx</url></CourseInfo><CourseInfo><course_id>HarvardX/PH210x/1T2014</course_id><title>United States Health Policy</title><published_date>2013-12-20T12:23:23-05:00</published_date><course_intro>Learn the essentials of U.S. health care policy from some of the nation's top experts.</course_intro><subject>Subject: Health &amp; Safety</subject><level>Level: Introductory</level><school>Institution: HarvardX</school><description>This is an Archived Course

Many Americans complain that they do not understand the U.S. health reform law called the Affordable Care Act (or Obamacare). They are right, and the main reason is because most Americans do not understand the basics of the U.S. health care system and U.S. health policy. Featuring some of the nation’s foremost teachers and thought leaders, this course provides students with a basic and thorough understanding of the U.S. health care system focusing on access, quality of care, and costs. Students will learn how the system is structured, how care is organized, delivered, and financed, and how the Affordable Care Act will influence the future of the system. Students will understand the U.S. health policy making structure process at the federal, state, and local levels. Students who complete this course will be able to interpret current controversies around US health policy and develop informed opinions on future policy developments.</description><learn_about>How the U.S. health care system is organized, financed, and governed

This course provides a mathematical introduction to the mechanics and control of robots that can be modeled as kinematic chains. Topics covered include the concept of a robot’s configuration space and degrees of freedom, static grasp analysis, the description of rigid body motions, kinematics of open and closed chains, and the basics of robot control. The emphasis is not on the latest research trends and technological innovations in robotics, but on learning the fundamental concepts and core principles that underlie robotics as a scientific discipline. The intent is to help students acquire a unified set of analytical tools for the modeling and control of robots, together with a reliable physical intuition that recognizes the unique and interdisciplinary nature of robotics—in short, content that will serve as a reliable foundation for whatever trends may appear later, and remain relevant to both the practitioner and researcher. This course is the first of two parts of “Robot Mechanics and Control.” Part II will start shortly after completion of Part I.</description><learn_about>Robot configuration space and degrees of freedom

A wondrously romantic belief is that brilliant thinkers magically produce brilliant ideas: Einstein jostles his hair and relativity falls out. We can enjoy these fanciful visions of leaps of genius, but we should not be fooled into believing that they’re reality. Brilliant innovators are brilliant because they practice habits of thinking that inevitably carry them step by step to works of genius. No magic and no leaps are involved.

Professor Starbird will discuss how habits of effective thinking and creativity can be taught and learned through mathematics. Anyone who practices them will inevitably create new insights, new ideas, and new solutions.

We live on the surface of a dynamic and yet paradoxically stable planet that experiences a remarkable range of energetic phenomena, from waves and currents in the ocean to wind and thunderstorms in the atmosphere. This course traces how the remarkable concept called energy is the natural way of describing, understanding and unifying these diverse phenomena. The course traces the cascade of energy from sunlight to its final destination in a thermal form, considering differential surface heating, the role of convection and buoyancy and the formation of the Earth’s circulation system, and the links to the ocean circulation system. We consider the curvature and rotation of the Earth as key constraints on a system driven by sunlight and energy transformations.</description><learn_about>How energy is transformed in its movement around the earth

Quantum computation is a remarkable subject building on the great computational discovery that computers based on quantum mechanics are exponentially powerful. This course aims to make this cutting-edge material broadly accessible to undergraduate students, including computer science majors who do not have any prior exposure to quantum mechanics. The course starts with a simple introduction to the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics using the concepts of qubits (or quantum bits) and quantum gates. This treatment emphasizes the paradoxical nature of the subject, including entanglement, non-local correlations, the no-cloning theorem and quantum teleportation. The course covers the fundamentals of quantum algorithms, including the quantum fourier transform, period finding, Shor's quantum algorithm for factoring integers, as well as the prospects for quantum algorithms for NP-complete problems. It also discusses the basic ideas behind the experimental realization of quantum computers, including the prospects for adiabatic quantum optimization and the D-Wave controversy.</description><learn_about>How to understand the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics using the concepts of qubits (or quantum bits) and quantum gates

Quantitative Methods in Clinical and Public Health Research is the online adaptation of material from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health's classes in epidemiology and biostatistics. Principled investigations to monitor and thus improve the health of individuals are firmly based on a sound understanding of modern quantitative methods. This involves the ability to discover patterns and extract knowledge from health data on a sample of individuals and then to infer, with measured uncertainty, the unobserved population characteristics. This course will address this need by covering the principles of biostatistics and epidemiology used for public health and clinical research. These include outcomes measurement, measures of associations between outcomes and their determinants, study design options, bias and confounding, probability and diagnostic tests, confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, power and sample size determinations, life tables and survival methods, regression methods (both, linear and logistic), and sample survey techniques. Students will analyze sample data sets to acquire knowledge of appropriate computer software. By the end of the course the successful student should have attained a sound understanding of these methods and a solid foundation for further study.
