But not many of those ideas are based on science. That’s where this course comes in.
“The Science of Happiness” is the first MOOC to teach the ground-breaking science of positive psychology, which explores the roots of a happy and meaningful life. Students will engage with some of the most provocative and practical lessons from this science, discovering how cutting-edge research can be applied to their own lives. Created by UC Berkeley’s Greater Good Science Center, the course will zero in on a fundamental finding from positive psychology: that happiness is inextricably linked to having strong social connections and contributing to something bigger than yourself—the greater good. Students will learn about the cross-disciplinary research supporting this view, spanning the fields of psychology, neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and beyond.
What’s more, “The Science of Happiness” offers students practical strategies for tapping into and nurturing their own happiness, including trying several research-backed activities that foster social and emotional well-being, and exploring how their own happiness changes along the way.
The course’s co-instructors, Dacher Keltner and Emiliana Simon-Thomas, are not only leading authorities on positive psychology but also gifted teachers skilled at making science fun and personal. They’ll be joined by world-renowned experts discussing themes like empathy, mindfulness, and gratitude—experts including Barbara Fredrickson, Paul Ekman, Sonja Lyubomirsky, and Jon Kabat-Zinn.

That crazy data collection from your boss? Megabytes of sensor data to analyze? Looking for a smart way visualize your data in order to make sense out of it? We’ve got you covered!
Using video lectures and hands-on exercises, we will teach you cutting-edge techniques and best practices that will boost your data analysis and visualization skills.
We will take a deep dive into data analysis with spreadsheets: PivotTables, VLOOKUPS, Named ranges, what-if analyses, making great graphs - all those will be covered in the first weeks of the course. After that, we will investigate the quality of the spreadsheet model, and especially how to make sure your spreadsheet remains error-free and robust.
Finally, once we have mastered spreadsheets, we will demonstrate other ways to store and analyze data. We will also look into how Python, a programming language, can help us with analyzing and manipulating data in spreadsheets.
EX101x is created using Excel 2013 and Windows. Most assignments can be made using another spreadsheet program and operating system as well, but we cannot offer full support for all configurations.
The goal of this course is to help you to overcome data analysis challenges in your work, research or studies. Therefore we encourage you to participate actively and to raise real data analysis problems that you face in our discussion forums. 
This course is part of the Data Analysis XSeries.

Learner Testimonials
“I’ve thought long and hard to come up with a better MOOC than this one (I’ve completed 25 of these things over the past 2 years) and can’t do it. 8.05x is #1 and I suspect will stay that way for some time to come.”
 “Being an engineering student from India trying to shift to Physics, I am often faced with the requirement to study topics on my own. Very often this has led me to feel inadequate. 8.05x was the perfect opportunity for me to both gain knowledge and evaluate my understanding on a high quality international platform. It has really exceeded my expectations. Now, at the end of fifteen weeks, I feel more confident and hopefully I am more knowledgeable.”</description><learn_about>Entanglement and Bell inequality.

This course teaches the basics of computer graphics that apply to all of these domains.

Students will learn to create computer-generated images of 3D scenes, including flybys of objects, make a real-time scene viewer, and create very realistic images with raytracing.  We will start with a simple example of viewing a teapot from anywhere in space, understanding the basic mathematics of virtual camera placement.  Next, you will learn how to use real-time graphics programming languages like OpenGL and GLSL to create your own scene viewer, enabling you to fly around and manipulate 3D scenes.  Finally, we will teach you to create highly realistic images with reflections and shadows using raytracing.CSE167x teaches the foundations of computer graphics. 
This course runs for 6 weeks and consists of four segments. Each segment includes an individual programming assignment:
Overview and Basic Math (Homework 0: 10% of grade)
Transformations (Homework 1: 20% of grade)
OpenGL and Lighting (Homework 2: 35% of grade)
Raytracing (Homework 3: 35% of grade)
This term, students who earn a total score of 50% or greater will have passed the course and may obtain a certificate from UC San DiegoX.
FAQ
What is the format of the class?
The class will consist of lecture videos, brief exercises, and homework assignments. Each of the four segments of the course will have 2-3 lectures. Each lecture includes 3-5 lecture videos, which last between 10 and 20 minutes. There will be a brief exercise after each lecture video to help you test your understanding of the material. 
Your score will be determined entirely by programming assignments for which you will receive immediate autograder feedback. You may submit your assignment to the autograder multiple times; only your last submission will count.
Programming projects are to be implemented individually without copying code from other students, largely identical online resources, or previous instances of the class. However, short of posting or sharing actual explicit code, you are encouraged to collaborate and discuss problems in the discussion forums.
Will the text of the lectures be available?
Yes. All of our lectures will have transcripts synced to the videos.
Do I need to watch the lectures live?
No. You can watch the lectures at your leisure. You can "work ahead" if you want to move faster than the due dates. Conversely, you can progress at a slower pace. Please note that certificates will only be awarded to students who obtain the requisite score by turning in assignments by the established deadlines.
How much does it cost to take the course?
Nothing: the course is free. If you expect to be doing a lot of graphics programming in the future, we would recommend the OpenGL and GLSL programming guides, but it is by no means required to purchase them. There are many free online resources for these topics, and we will be posting links to them.
What computer system do I need for the course?
The course material involves C++/OpenGL/GLSL programming that is portable. We provide skeleton code for all major platforms (Windows, Mac OS, Linux). This is a modern course involving programmable shaders, but any machine built in the last few years should be adequate. We provide many compilation hints and tips, and Homework 0 is to ensure you can compile and work with the autograder. You do need some kind of C++ development environment; we provide several resources to get you started for Homework 0. In the highly unlikely event you cannot get your machine to work, you will hopefully have adequate time to find another system.
Will I learn Maya/DirectX/3D Studio Max etc.?
This is a course on the foundations of computer graphics and covers concepts, not the intricacies of a particular software package. That said, you will be able to write complex interactive and offline 3D graphics programs at the end of the course in C++, OpenGL and GLSL.

This novel is among the first in major American literature to be written in dialect, characterized by regional Southern English. While this makes the writing difficult to understand at first, it also gives us a window into the language of the time.

The story is noted for its colorful descriptions of people and places along the Mississippi River. Set in the American South after the Civil War, this book features a society that has ceased to exist about twenty years prior. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is often described as a satire on deep-rooted attitudes, particularly racism, in the South.
 
Participants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion.

El Cálculo Diferencial es el lenguaje en el que algunas leyes de la naturaleza se expresan, por ejemplo: nos permite describir el movimiento y el cálculo de trayectorias en dinámica, nos ayuda a resolver problemas de áreas y volúmenes, a resolver problemas extremales en campos como economía y matemática financiera.
En este curso se presentan los conceptos y demostraciones con extrema precisión y cuidado; se hace énfasis en los fundamentos del Cálculo para que lo que se enseña quede fundamentado y claramente explicado.
Se estudia el cálculo diferencial de funciones de variable real, por lo tanto, se parte de una estructura algebraica de los números reales. Utiliza conceptos puramente métricos, por eso se introduce el concepto de distancia para explicar que nos vamos acercando a algo, es decir, se define la estructura del espacio métrico  que da paso al primer tema sucesiones de números reales continúa con sucesiones convergentes, derivadas de una función hasta llegar a problemas extremales en dos variables y multiplicadores de Lagrange.</description><learn_about>no info</learn_about><url>https://www.edx.org/course/calculo-diferencial-galileox-cmath001x</url></CourseInfo></ROOT>
